From the western corner, all types of weather comes into the world. And from the northern corner destruction comes into the world. The northern corner Hashem created, but didn't finish. He said, 'Anyone who claims to be a god, come and finish this northern corner. When you come to try and finish it, you will see that I am G-d.' From the northern corner comes all demons and evil spirits, and all destructive forces into the world. This is what it means 'From the north evil shall break forth.'\""
