                "Rabbi Elazar ben Shammua was once walking by the seashore when he noticed a boat sinking at sea. A moment later he watched as a man holding onto a plank of wood floated onto shore. Other Jews were walking by. Because the man was naked, he covered himself and pleased: \"I am a son of Esau, your brother. I have lost everything. Please give me a garment to cover myself.\" The Jews refused and said: \"Your people have treated our people with cruelty. Therefore, may all your people be stripped bare as you are today.\" The man then turned to Rabbi Elazar and said, \"You are an honorable man; please help me.\" Rabbi Elazar took off a garment and gave it to him. Then he brought him to his home, fed him, and gave him money with which to begin his life again.", 
                "When the emperor died, the rescued man succeeded him. He ordered that all Jews in his state be killed.  The Jews turned to Rabbi Elazar and asked him to plead for them. When the man, who was now the ruler, saw Rabbi Elazar standing before him, he said: \"Does not your Torah teach 'You shall not hate an Edomite, for he is your brother'? I told your people that I was the son of Esau, and they treated me with hatred, not with kindness.\"", 
                "Rabbi Elazar replied: \"Though they are guilty of breaking the law of the Torah, forgive them.\"", 
                "The king, recalling what Elazar had done for him, answered: \"Because of what you did for me, I will forgive them.\""
