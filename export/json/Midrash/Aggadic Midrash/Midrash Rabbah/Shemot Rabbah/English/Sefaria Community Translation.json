            "\"And the child (Moses) grew\" - Twenty four months she nursed him, and you say \"and the child grew\"?! Rather he grew, not in the way of the [rest] land. “And she brought him to the daughter of Pharaoh…” The daughter of Pharaoh would kiss and hug and adore him (Moses) as if he were her own son, and she would not take him out of the king’s palace. And because [Moses] was so beautiful, everyone yearned to see him. One that would see him would not leave his presence. And it was that Pharaoh would kiss him (Moses) and hug him, and he would remove Pharaoh’s crown and place it on his own head, as he would do to him in the future when he was great. And just as the Holy One Blessed is He said to Hiram (Ezekiel 28:18), “…I have brought fire from within you, it will consume you…”, similarly the daughter of Pharaoh raised the one who would punish her father in the future. And even the anointed king, that is destined to punish Edom, sits among them in their [own] province, as it says (Isaiah 27:10) “…there shall the calf (the Messiah) graze and there lie down and destroy its branches.” And some of the observers sitting among them were the magicians of Egypt that said, “We are wary of this, that he is taking your crown and placing it on his head, that he not be the one we say (i.e. prophesy) that will take the kingship from you.” Some said to kill him, and some said to burn him. And Jethro was sitting among them and said to them, “This child has no intent [to take the throne]. Rather, test him by bringing in a bowl [a piece of] gold and a coal. If he outstretches his hand towards the gold, [surely] he has intent [to take the throne], and you should kill him. And if he outstretches his hand towards the coal, he [surely] does not have intent [to take the throne], and he does not deserve the death penalty.” They immediately brought the bowl before him (Moses), and he outstretched his hand to take the gold, and Gabriel came and pushed his (Moses’) hand, and he grabbed the coal. He then brought his hand along with the coal into his mouth and burned his tongue, and from this was made (Exodus 4:10) “slow of speech and slow of tongue.” “And she called his name ‘Moshe’” – From here you can learn about the merit of those that perform acts of kindness. Even though Moses had many names, the only name that was set throughout the Torah, was the name that Bathyah daughter of Pharaoh called him. Even the Holy One Blessed is He did not call him by another name."

            "Our teachers have said: Once, while Moses our Teacher was tending [his father-in-law] Yitro’s sheep, one of the sheep ran away. Moses ran after it until it reached a small, shaded place. There, the lamb came across a pool and began to drink. As Moses approached the lamb, he said, “I did not know you ran away because you were thirsty. You are so exhausted!” He then put the lamb on his shoulders and carried him back. The Holy One said, “Since you tend the sheep of human beings with such overwhelming love - by your life, I swear you shall be the shepherd of My sheep, Israel.”..."

            "\"These are the laws...\" - That's is what is written, (Psalms 99:4) \"The King is mighty, He loves justice (lit. law).\" When is might given to the Holy One, blessed be He? When He does justice to the gentiles. For so was it manifest at Nebuchadnezzar the wicked, because he became haughty and said, (Daniel 4:27) \"Is this Babylon not great?\" The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, \"Wicked one! You, putrid spit, become haughty and say, (ibid.) \"The strength of my power and the honor of my majesty\"? [Do you] not know that all is Mine? Greatness is mine! Power is Mine! Honor is Mine! Majesty is Mine! So did David say, (I Chronicles 29:11) \"To You, O God, is greatness, and strength, and majesty...\" And he says, (Psalms 104:1) \"God, my God, You are very great...\" Said the Holy One, blessed be He to Nebuchadnezzar, \"The little kingship given to you is Mine.\" And so Daniel said to him, (Daniel 2:37) \"For the God of heaven has given you a kingdom, power, strength, and glory.\" - And you say 'the strength of my power and the honor of my majesty'?! Really, \"the King is mighty, He loves justice\", the might of the king of all kings, the Holy One, blessed be He, Who loves justice and gave it to Israel Whom He loves. And that which is written, (Psalms 99:4) \"You have established fairness\" - you have established fairness for your those who love you. For through the laws you gave them, they fight each other, and come for judgement, and then they make peace. Israel said before the Holy One, blessed be He: Master of the world! Until when will You withhold judgment from the gentiles? [God] said to them: When their iniquities fully ripen, as it says (Isaiah 27:2) \"In that day, chant about the fruitful vineyard!\" Does anyone pick his vineyard before it is fully ripe?! Rather after it is ripe, he picks it and puts it into the vat, and then he treads on it [to press it] and sings, and they chant responsively. So did the Holy One, blessed be He, say to Israel: Wait for Me, until Edom's iniquities become [ripe], and I will tread on it, as it states, (Psalms 60:10) \"On Edom I toss My sandal.\" I will open for you and you will respond after me. Therefore it says (Isaiah 27:2) \"In that day, chant about the fruitful vineyard!\" and (Isaiah 27:3) \"I the Lord guard it, I water it every moment.\" I am the one who watches over her to make her drink many cups, as it says, ‘I water it every moment.’ If I but come and glance at them, I obliterate them from the world, but \"Anger is not in Me,\" (Isaiah 27:4) but they are filled with anger against My children. But what will I do to them? \"I step forward and set them all on fire\" (ibid.). Rabbi Levi said: God said to the idolators: ' Israel is Mine, as it says, \"For the children of Israel are Mine as servants  (Leviticus 25:55), and anger is Mine, as it says, \"God avenges and is the master of wrath\" (Nahum 1:2), and you are filled with what is Mine against Mine?!’ As it says, Who will give me thorns and thistles will be at war! (Isaiah 27:4) Our Rabbis said that God said to them: ' If I were to change My measured way of Judgment, I would obliterate  them in a single flash of lighting, as it says, \"If I sharpen (or, 'change') the flash of My sword\" (Deut. 32:41) But what do I do? \"My hand grabs hold of Justice'  (ibid). It also says, \"Or let him take hold of My strength (Isaiah 27:5), and 'My strength' means Judgment, as it says, \"And strength to the king who loves Justice.\" (Psalms. 99:4) God said to Israel, ‘Just as I could overstep the bounds of judgment on the idolators, but I do not overstep them but hold on to judgment, so too, you must not go out of the bounds of judgment,’ as it says, \"And these are the laws.\""

            "Another explanation for zeh hadavar: “Take with you words. . .”(d’varim, Ho 14:3). This is what is meant by what is written: “I wash my palms with cleanliness and circle your altar, Yahh, to voice thanks aloud and to tell of all your miracles.” (Ps 26:6f) One might also offer bulls and rams, but exegesis says to voice thanks aloud. Accordingly, Jews say, “Ribon HaOlam (“master of the universe”), leaders sin and bring and bring a korban (“offering”) and it atones for them. The mashiach sins and brings a korban and it atones for him. We, we have no korban.” He said to them: “And if all the congregation of Yisrael stray–and the matter is hidden from the eyes of the community–and they are guilty of doing one of the negative commandments of Yahh, then, if the sin guilt for which they sinned becomes known, the community shall offer a bull of the herd as a sin offering.”(Lev 4:13f) They say to him, “We are poor and we have not what to bring for korbanot.” He says to them, “Words, I request, as it is said, ‘Take with you words and return to Yahh’ and I annul all your misdeeds.” These words are none other than divrey Torah, as it is said, “These are the d’varim that Moshe spoke to all Yisrael.(Dt 1:1) They said to him, “We do not know.” He said to them, “Weep and pray before me and I accept it. Your ancestors, when they were enslaved in Mitsrayim, it wasn’t for prayer that I redeemed them, as it is said, ‘The B’neiYisrael groaned from the work and cried out.’(Ex 2:23)In the days of Y’hoshua it wasn’t for prayer that I made miracles for them, as it is said, ‘Y’hoshua tore his garment and fell on his face before the ark of Yahh till evening.’(Jos 7:6) So what did I say to him? ‘Hold out the spear which is in your hand towards The Ai, for I give it into your hand.’(Jos 8:18) In the days of the Judges, with weeping I heard their outcry, as it is said, ‘It happened, when the B’neiYisrael cried out to Yahh on account of Midyan.’(Ju 6:7) In the days of Sh’muel it was not in prayer that I heard them, as it is said, ‘Sh’muel cried out to Yahh on behalf of Yisrael and Yahh responded to him.’(Sam 7:9) And similarly the men of Y’rushalayim, even though they had angered me, because they wept before me I had mercy on them, as it is said, ‘For thus said Yahh, “Sing out joy to Ya’akov. . .”(Jer 31:7) Oh, I request from you not sacrifices and not korbanot but words, as it is said, ‘Take with you words. . .’ This is why David said, ‘I wash my hands with cleanliness’ not intending to make an offering but to voice thanks aloud, for I am thankful to you for divrey Torah."
