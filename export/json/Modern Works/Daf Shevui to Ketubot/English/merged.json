            "Introduction<br>Ketubot, Daf Bet, Part 1 Introduction Ketuboth opens by discussing on which days of the week a virgin marries, and on which days of the week a widow (or divorcee) marries. Note that these customs have not been observed for a very long time, probably already from the time of the Talmud, and may not have even been observed in the times of the Mishnah itself.", 
            "Explanation<br> According to the mishnah a virgin is married on Wednesday so that if the husband wants to make a claim against her that she was not a virgin, he can come directly to the court which sits on Mondays and Thursdays and make a claim against her. If his virginity claim against her is accepted by the court, he may divorce her without paying her the ketubah. The chapter will continue to discuss the issue of virginity claims and how the judge is to adjudicate them. Note that virginity claims are already mentioned in Deuteronomy 22:13-22. The virginity of the bride was of high value in the ancient world and a man who thought that he was marrying a virgin but found that she was not had the right to claim that he had mistakenly married her. The mishnah does not state why widows are married on Thursday. This will be found later in the Talmud.", 
            "Shmuel asks why the Mishnah says that a virgin is married on the fourth day. Now we should note that his very question is puzzling—the Mishnah already stated why a virgin is married on Wednesday! The Talmud will ask this question soon. For now the answer is that we need a certain day to determine when a virgin is to be married so that we can know when the husband is obligated to feed her. A mishnah in the fifth chapter teaches that if the time for marriage comes and they are not married, she eats his food and if he is a Kohen, she may eat terumah. Let’s say they set the first of Adar as the wedding date. But the first of Adar falls on a Tuesday. In such a case the husband’s obligation to sustain his wife does not begin until Wednesday, for she would only be married on Wednesday. Furthermore, if she is married to a Kohen, it is from this date and onwards that she can begin to eat terumah, the food that only a priest may eat.", 
            "R. Joseph now raises a difficulty on the very statement that he himself transmitted in the name of Shmuel. [This is a strange phenomenon]. The difficulty seems to be that Shmuel used a source that was not taught [in the Mishnah] to explain another source that was taught [in the Mishnah]. However, even this difficulty is wrong. What Shmuel had really done is take one mishnah from the fifth chapter of Ketubot and used it to explain our mishnah from the first chapter of Ketubot. Therefore the Talmud rephrases his difficulty. Shmuel has used a mishnah that already has an explanation (our mishnah in the first chapter) and explained it with another mishnah that doesn’t have an explanation. This too is not such an easy difficulty—after all, the other mishnah is self-explanatory. Nevertheless, in tomorrow’s section we will see a rewritten version of Shmuel’s statement. If you’re wondering why this sugya seems to say so many things that do not make sense, it may be that it has been redacted or reedited so many times that the original meaning of Shmuel was lost in the shuffle. This is typical of sugyot at the beginning of tractates.", 
            "Introduction<br>In yesterday’s section the chapter opened explaining why virgins are married on Wednesday. Our section continues to discuss the subject.", 
            "This reworded statement of Shmuel is basically the mishnah: A virgin is married on Wednesday so that if her husband wishes to make a virginity claim, he can go to the court the next day. However, this version adds a difficulty. If virgins are wedded on Wednesday so that their husbands could come to court on Thursday with a virginity claim, then why not let them be married on Sunday and come to court on Monday. After all the court sits twice a week—Mondays and Thursdays.", 
            "Virgins are not married on Mondays because that would not leave enough time after Shabbat to prepare a proper wedding feast.", 
            "This now connects up with the earlier statement made by R. Joseph, but expands on it. If the time to get married arrives on the first day of the week, he does not feed her until the fourth day of the week. Furthermore, we learn a precedent from that case. If for some reason they cannot get married (illness or menstruation) then he need not give her food. Note that this is true even if he is sick and therefore the delay in marrying her is his fault. With regard to menstruation, women who were menstruating used to postpone their marriages because they could not have sex. Nowadays, weddings are no longer delayed for this reason.", 
            "Introduction<br>At the end of yesterday’s section we learned that if the husband or the wife delayed the wedding because of illness or menstruation, he must begin to provide her with food as soon as the date set for the wedding has passed. Today, the Talmud says that this is a question.", 
            "The Mishnah (in chapter five) clearly stated that if he has to wait a few days to marry her until Wednesday, he is not obligated to feed her until Wednesday. Note that this is at most a week’s delay. The question posed here is whether this is a precedent for other types of delays. If he can’t marry her because he is sick is he exempt from feeding her because in here too he was prevented against his will from marrying her. Or are the two cases different?", 
            "The Talmud now advances the question. If we say that if he became sick he has to provide her with food, because the delay in marriage was his fault, what if she became sick? Perhaps he could say to her that he is ready to get married, and that the delay is her fault. Therefore, he would not be obligated to provide for her. Or perhaps she could say to him in essence, tough luck. “Your field was flooded”—nothing you could do about it, but you lost out.", 
            "The Talmud now advances the question one final step. If illness might be considered his tough luck and therefore he would have to provide her with food, what about a case where she begins to menstruate and therefore has to delay the marriage? If she menstruates at her regular time, there is no doubt she cannot say to him, “Your field has been flooded” because she could have known that she was going to begin to menstruate. This was expected and therefore cannot simply be considered his bad luck. But what if she menstruates at an irregular time—can she say to him, “Your bad luck” or might this be considered the same situation as menstruating at a regular time since not all women menstruate with regularity?"
        ], 
        [
            "The mishnah uses the passive voice “they were not married” and not the active, “They did not marry them.” This means that even if the delay comes from the women, they still receive food from their husbands. However, the question is what sort of delay? If the women intentionally delayed the marriage, why should they eat of his food? That would not be fair at all. Therefore, it must refer to a situation where they were forced to delay the marriage. Nevertheless, even though the delay was due to the women, the husbands must provide them with food.", 
            "R. Ashi rejects R. Aha’s precise reading of the mishnah. He holds that only if the husband delays the marriage must he provide her with food. If the woman delays the marriage, the husband is not liable to provide for her until she is ready. The reason the mishnah used the passive, thereby referring to the woman, is to preserve the subject of the beginning of the mishnah which reads, “They give a virgin 12 months to get ready for the wedding.” Since the passive was only used to preserve the parallel with the first clause, we cannot read anything into its use.", 
            "Introduction<br>In the previous sugya we learned that if the husband was prevented by force (such as illness) from marrying his wife, he need not provide her with food. Thus we take situations of “force” (a person was prevented from doing something not of his choice) into account. The question in our sugya is whether or not force is taken into account in matters of divorce. The sugya will explain what this means.", 
            "According to Rava when it comes to divorce we don’t take issues of “force” into account. The Talmud will now give us some situations where this issue arises.", 
            "The Talmud now tries to find an earlier source for Rava. The first source is a mishnah that teaches that if a husband gives his wife a get and says to her that it will be valid only if he doesn’t return within twelve months, and then he dies within twelve months, the get is not valid because he did not return. The Talmud tries to derive from this mishnah what the rule would be if he didn’t come back because he got sick (“force”). The mishnah said it’s not a get if he dies—but if he doesn’t come back because he was sick, then the get would be valid. From here we could learn that “force” is not taken into account in matters of divorce. However, this derivation is not certain. It could be that the mishnah uses the example of death to teach us that death cannot occur after divorce. If this is what the mishnah teaches us then we could not deduce from it that if he is sick, the get is still valid.", 
            "The Mishnah already taught that there can be no divorce after death in an earlier mishnah. This would free up the mishnah of “if I do not return within twelve months” to teach that only death would prevent the get from being valid. If he doesn’t return due to illness “force” then the get would be valid.", 
            "The Talmud now posits that the mishnah about “If I don’t return within twelve months” was meant to teach against the ruling of “our rabbis” who said that the effectiveness of a document is set by its date. For instance if a man writes “thirteenth of Nisan” in his document but then says it won’t be operative until later, the document goes into effect on the thirteenth of Nisan. The mishnah rules against this position—if he says “after twelve months” then he meant to divorce her only after twelve months. Since that mishnah was needed to rule against this position of “our rabbis” it is not possible to use it prove that if he was prevented by “force” the get is valid. This leaves us with no proof of Rava’s overall position that “force” is not taken into account. The argument continues in tomorrow’s section.", 
            "Introduction<br>Today’s section continues searching for a source for Rava’s rule that we don’t take “force” into account when determining the validity of a get. As we saw what this means is that if a husband says his get will be valid if he doesn’t return within a certain period and then something happens that prevents him from returning the get is valid. The fact that it wasn’t his choice not to return (he was “forced” not to return) is not taken into account.", 
            "The mishnah says that if the husband makes such a statement and then dies before he can make it back to his wife within the twelve months the get is valid. At first the Talmud assumes that the same would be true if he grew ill. This would prove Rava’s point—we don’t take cases of “force” into consideration when determining the validity of the get.", 
            "Again the Talmud rejects the above deduction. Perhaps she is divorced only when he dies, for we could assume in that case he did not want her to be subject to the laws of levirate marriage (marriage to her dead husband’s brother in a case where the husband had no offspring). As an aside, this is why men sometimes would have written conditional gets. If they divorce their wives before they die, then the wife would not be liable for levirate marriage. Being subject to marrying his brother may not have been so desirable.<br>In any case, if the husband got sick and was prevented from returning within twelve months, he would have wanted to stay married to her. So therefore in this case it would not be a valid get. Again, we have failed to find a source for Rava’s ruling.", 
            "Here the Talmud finds a story as proof that we don’t take “force” into account.  Even if it is obvious that he wanted to return, if he’s not back, it doesn’t count. Shmuel states this explicitly. This would serve as a perfect source for Rava’s general rule that we don’t take “force” into account.", 
            "The Talmud now distinguishes between a regular case of “force” that could have been anticipated, and an unusual case. The case of the ferry not being able to cross over is a regular case. The husband should have stipulated before that if the ferry caused his delay, it would count as if he had returned. But the case of being sick is not regular. Therefore, we might take that into account. And if he is sick and cannot return for that reason, the get would be valid.<br>Thus we still have no support for Rava’s general principle. Stay tuned for tomorrow’s exciting conclusion.", 
            "Introduction<br>Today’s section concludes the search for a source for Rava’s rule if a husband cannot return due to duress the get is considered valid, even though he wanted to return and thereby annul the get.", 
            "Having failed to find an earlier source for Rava’s rule, the Talmud now resolves to saying that he stated his own reasoning. Basically he ruled that “force” is not taken into account due to the problems that would occur if it were taken into account.<br>The first problem would be for overly modest women. Let’s say that we were to take “force” into account, meaning if the husband was delayed by circumstances out of his control, the get would be invalid. In such a case, after twelve months the husband doesn’t return. For all we know he decided not to return of his own volition, as could happen. Maybe he found a different wife or a different job somewhere else. But the wife is afraid that maybe he didn’t return due to duress. She would wait for him like an “agunah”—a chained wife—and not remarry. This would obviously be a terrible situation. Therefore Rava rules that we don’t take into account why the husband did not return."
        ], 
        [
            "The problem would also occur with what the Talmud terms “loose” women. Let’s say the husband doesn’t return and it was actually due to duress. If the halakhah was that we do take duress into account, then she is not divorced. She might disregard this possibility and go get married. When he comes back and proves that he could not return due to duress, the second marriage would be annulled and any children she had from her second husband would be mamzerim. This is obviously also a terrible result.<br>Thus, to summarize, it is best for everyone if duress is not taken into account. If the husband does not return in time, the get is valid. Why he did not return is not taken into consequence.", 
            "Introduction<br>In yesterday’s section we learned that Rava does not accept claims of “force” in matters of divorce because “modest women” might wait too long to get remarried and “loose women” might not wait long enough. What this seems to mean is that if the husband does not return because of “force/duress” legally she should not be divorced but the rabbis do consider her divorced in order to avoid certain problems. The issue here is that if she is not divorced how can the rabbis just consider her divorced? Isn’t that in essence allowing a married woman to marry another man! This is the topic addressed here.", 
            "If according to the laws of the Torah she should be married because the divorce should not have been effective (the fact that he didn’t return under duress should be taken into account), then how can the rabbis treat her as divorced?", 
            "The answer is affirmative. Basically, when people get married, they do so according to rabbinic law. They are buying into the system, if you will. Therefore, the rabbis always retain the power to annul their betrothal. This would mean that effectively, they were never married in the first place.<br>I should note that this statement appears six times in the Talmud. It almost certainly was not originally stated here, for here the topic is divorce, not betrothal. The rabbis are not annulling his betrothal, they are annulling his attempt to nullify his divorce. The statement was brought here to show the power of the rabbis to determine who and who is not married.", 
            "Ravina now asks a question of R. Ashi. It makes sense to say that the rabbis annul the betrothal if he betrothed her with money. Since they seem to have created this system of betrothal, they have the power to annul it. However, do they have such power if he betrothed her through intercourse, which is one of the three ways in which a man can betroth a woman (money, document or intercourse). It seems that this sugya considers intercourse to be a more de’orayta, or perhaps more valid, form of betrothal, than money. We should note that most sugyot consider all three forms of betrothal to be equally valid.<br>The answer is that the rabbis have the power to change the nature of his intercourse with her, or at least the legal ramifications of it. While he (and she) might have thought that they were engaging in intercourse for the sake of betrothal, the rabbis have the power to say that it is in essence an act of fornication. This would mean that her betrothal would be effectively annulled.", 
            "Introduction<br>This entire section is a mirror image of the previous sections. The sugya about divorce began with Rava saying, “And for matters of divorce, this is not so. Therefore Rava holds: There is no ‘force’ in matters of divorce.” The sugya proceeded searching for sources for Rava’s statement (and ultimately failed). In this section Rava says the exact opposite, and every source that was used to support him above, is here used as a difficulty on him here. But just as these sources failed to support him, they also fail to refute him. In the end both statements are left neither supported nor refuted.<br>This phenomenon of mirror-image sugyot occurs occasionally in rabbinic literature. It may be the result of the oral transmission of the literature—i.e. people did not know what earlier rabbis had said. Alternatively, it may be the result of later generations intentionally emending what earlier rabbis had said.<br>Since we have already basically learned this material, my commentary is brief below.", 
            "From this Mishnah the rabbis try to deduce that if he was prevented from returning by any other cause besides death, the divorce would be valid. This would prove that force is not taken into account (it is not a valid excuse for not returning on time).", 
            "The Mishnah may use the example of death not to teach that dying is different from not returning for any other reason. It may be to teach that he can’t divorce his wife once he is dead. If so, then even if he doesn’t return for another reason, she is still not divorced.", 
            "The fact that an earlier Mishnah also seems to teach that there is no divorce after death may be just to reject the opinion of the other rabbis who hold that we follow the date written on the document, not the date on which he says it will take effect. Thus we have two mishnayot: One teaches that there is no divorce after death, and the other stresses that this is true even if the date on the document is earlier than the date of death.", 
            "This Mishnah seems to teach that no matter why he doesn’t come back, death or illness, within twelve months, she is divorced. This would imply that there is no excuse of “force” in matters of divorce. This would be a difficulty on the second version of Rava’s statement.<br>But this reading is again rejected—it may be that the husband wanted to stipulate that if he dies within the twelve months, the divorce is valid so that his wife could avoid being subject to levirate marriage. But if he is prevented from returning for another reason, he would not want her to be divorced.", 
            "Again, this story seems like clear evidence that we don’t take “force” into account. Even if we know for sure that he wants to come back, and he was prevented by the lack of a ferry from crossing the river, he is still not considered as having returned on time to annul the get. “Force” is not taken into account. This is a difficulty for the second version of Rava’s statement.<br>The Talmud resolves the difficulty on Rava by proposing that this may be a different case, for the lack of a ferry is a foreseeable reason for not returning on time (like traffic today). In such a case, the husband should have stipulated at the outset that if the ferry prevents him from crossing the river, he will still be considered as having returned to annul the get. However, if the case was not foreseeable, then “force” might still be a proper excuse.<br>The sugya thus ends without a difficulty on Rava’s statement. Post-talmudic authorities were therefore left with two contradictory statements by Rava (there is/there is not “force” in matters of divorce).", 
            "Introduction<br>Today’s section returns to the Mishnah, which had stated that virgins were married on Wednesdays so that if the husband has a virginity claim, he could get to the court the next day.", 
            "Shmuel b. Yitzchak notes that the mishnah’s rule—that a virgin is wedded on Wednesday, depends on Ezra’s enactment that the courts should sit on Mondays and Thursdays. Before Ezra, who lived when the Jews returned from Babylonia in the fifth century C.E., the courts, at least according to this source, would sit every day of the week. During those times, it would not have mattered when a virgin was married for he could always go to the court the next day.<br>I should note that this source should not be taken at historical face value. It is unclear how historical any of the attributions of these enactments to Ezra are, and even if they were accurate, it is doubtful that Ezra would have limited the days on which the court convened. Rather, what is more likely is that at some point the days in which a court convened became standardized, coordinated with the market days which took place on Monday and Thursday. However, even this is not historically certain.", 
            "The Talmud notes that the way in which R. Shmuel’s statement is phrased lacks any halakhic significance. Why should we care what happened in the days before Ezra’s enactment? What does this teach us about the current situation?<br>The answer is that there are ramifications for today. If there are courts that sit today on other days of the week, not just Mondays and Thursdays, then a woman could be married any day of the week.<br>This answer in my opinion cuts to the original intent of R. Shmuel b. Yitzchak. By his time the system of fixed dates for courts was probably long in disuse (this can be noted in many other places in rabbinic literature, especially Tractate Megillah). What he is saying is that now that courts do not have fixed date, the rules of the Mishnah are also outdated.", 
            "There is another problem with her being married on any day of the week. If he marries her too early in the week, how can he prepare for the wedding? Above we learned that the sages did not allow him to marry her on Sunday for this would not give him time to prepare a proper wedding feast.<br>The Talmud almost ignores this question. As long as he did prepare diligently for the wedding, he can marry her whenever he wants. Again we can see that the system of fixed days of the week for marriage seems to have fallen apart. By this period in history, people seem to have been ignoring the tannaitic sources and getting married whenever they so desired."
        ], 
        [
            "Introduction<br>Today’s section contains a baraita which goes into greater detail concerning what days of the week a virgin is married. The baraita will be explained in the coming sections as well.", 
            "This source was explained above at the beginning of the tractate. Although the court sits on Monday, theoretically allowing him to get to the court with a virginity claim should he marry her on Sunday, the rabbis did not allow this for this would not give him time to prepare a proper wedding feast. Marrying her on Wednesday allows for three days of preparation before the wedding. ", 
            "The baraita now notes that in reality people are no longer observing these customs. After the time of “danger” they took on the custom to marry on Tuesday. “Danger” usually refers to Roman persecution of the first and second centuries C.E.. The topic will be addressed in tomorrow’s passage.<br>And if there is duress, they get married on Mondays. Again, this will be explained (to a certain extent) tomorrow.", 
            "According to this source, sex with a virgin is prohibited on Shabbat for it makes a wound, and making a wound (intentionally) is considered prohibited. There will be a long passage that deals with this issue later in the Talmud. For now we should note what is odd here—if he marries her on Wednesday, why are they having sex for the first time on Friday night? It is possible that this baraita already relates to the later practice of getting married on Friday. This was common in the middle ages, but it is not clear whether it is reflected here or not.", 
            "Introduction<br>In yesterday’s section we saw a baraita which taught that in times of “danger” people began to have the custom of getting married on Tuesdays. Our sugya attempts to define this danger.", 
            "If the danger is of death, meaning that the Romans persecute the Jews in order to force them to abolish their custom of marrying virgins on Wednesday, then why does it use such temperate language—they had a custom to marry on Tuesday? They should abolish the custom altogether.<br>Rather, the danger is that the Romans decree that a virgin should first have relations with the governor. To avoid this, the Jews moved weddings to Tuesday.<br>We should note how historically problematic this source is. First of all, most scholars do not believe there ever was a “decree of the right of the first night.” This is a folk myth/fear that appears in many cultures, including several places in rabbinic literature. But scholars do not believe that it is historically accurate.<br>Second, how would moving the wedding to Tuesday have helped? The Romans would have figured things out pretty quickly, and begun raping virgins getting married on Tuesday. This question is asked below by the Talmud itself.<br>For these and other reasons as well, it seems unlikely that this explanation is historical. Rather, in my opinion what the baraita really seems to say is that when people saw that Romans were persecuting Jews at their weddings, they abandoned their consistent wedding practices. While this might be expressed by “they had the custom to marry on Tuesday,” it may mean that they just stopped marrying on Wednesday. I should note though that there is no historical evidence that Romans persecuted Jews specifically at their weddings.", 
            "Why call this danger when it is really a case of “duress.” Meaning that being raped is not a matter of life and death, and therefore why call it “danger” which usually means death.<br>The answer is that there are some women who would rather be killed than be raped by the governor. Therefore this is indeed a matter of life and death. It truly is “danger.”", 
            "A woman who is raped is not prohibited from returning to her husband, unlike an adulteress who is. Therefore, there is no reason for chaste women to prefer to die than be raped. These women should be taught that they should not choose martyrdom over rape. And then if it’s not a matter of life and death, why change the custom. [I fully realize that this is a very difficult thing to read. And I stipulate that the rabbis were often not particularly sensitive to women, including in this remark. Perhaps I could suggest one positive side to this comment. What they are saying is that when a woman has been raped, as horrible as that may be, she need not allow her life to be ruined. Or better yet, society must not look at such a woman as “ruined,” a tendency that certainly existed in the ancient world and still exists in some circles today. She can legally return to her husband and go on with her life. And her husband must take her back. I know this still makes people uncomfortable. Rape is a very difficult subject to discuss, especially for a man, which I am.]<br>The problem is that there are women who may intentionally have relations with the Roman governor. Such women are considered adulteresses and are legally not allowed to return to their husbands.<br>Furthermore, there is the issue of women married to kohanim (called here priestesses, or kohanot). A woman married to a priest who has been raped is not allowed to return to her husband, even though she clearly did nothing wrong. So simply allowing the Roman governor to rape these women before their marriage would prevent them from marrying their intended husbands.", 
            "If the Roman governor is decreeing that all virgins must first have relations with him, then the enactment to marry on Wednesday should be completely abolished. Why does the baraita just say that “people had the custom?”<br>The answer is that we don’t simply uproot a rabbinic enactment due to a persecution decreed by our oppressors. This is, I believe, a deep message. The persecutions we Jews undergo are temporary. Our traditions are what more permanent and we do not easily abandon them.", 
            "This is the question I asked above—if they move the custom of marrying virgins on a specific day, the governor will just come and have intercourse with the bride on that day.<br>The answer is that once the custom has been disrupted, the governor will not bother himself to seek out Jewish weddings. This might hint at what I had stated above. The baraita may testify to a general abandonment of fixed days for weddings, and not to their having been moved to another specific day. If the governor knows that virgins are married on Wednesdays, he will bring his men out to the Jewish wedding. But if he is not sure of this custom, he will not bother.", 
            "Introduction<br>Today’s section explains the last part of the baraita we have been studying, according to which if there is “duress” he can marry the virgin bride even on the second day of the week. The issue our section asks is what does the baraita mean by duress?", 
            "The problem is that the previous clause in the baraita said that due to danger people began to get married on Tuesdays. We obviously cannot explain the current clause in the same way we explained the earlier clause. So what does “duress” mean?", 
            "Rava suggests that the “duress” is a general coming to town, who assumedly may kill the Jews for publicly celebrating their wedding. The assumption is that they know he is coming on Wednesday. So then, the Talmud asks, why not get married on Tuesday? The answer is that if the general comes on Wednesday, his vanguard will show up on Tuesday. Under such a circumstance it is permitted to get married on Monday.<br>We should note that what this section is really trying to state, albeit in a circuitous manner, is that if there is any danger whatsoever, the wedding may be moved.<br>I should also note that Rava said both interpretations of the baraita—that the governor is coming to rape the virgin bride and that the general is coming to town. In my opinion, it is possible that originally he stated both of these statements on the same section of the baraita, but that the Talmud’s editors wished to use them as interpretations for both sections. This may explain some of the difficulties over the last two days."

Today’s section opens with an alternate explanation of “duress.” I should note that what the following sugya really wishes to do is explore the connection between mourning and marriage. This is not so much an explanation of the earlier baraita as it is an explanation of what is done in a case where a close relative dies right before a planned wedding. The idea of discussing marriage and mourning laws in juxtaposition will be a constant theme over the next couple of pages.", 
            "The reason one may need to get married on a day that differs from the prescribed fourth day of the week is if his or her mother or father died right before the wedding. Before I explain the baraita itself, I should note that this is a difficult explanation of “duress.” After all, if the wedding was supposed to be on Wednesday, and “duress” supposedly allows them to get married on Monday, then why was the bread baked etc. already on Monday. These are preps done at the last minute to make sure the food is fresh. It seems almost impossible that such a circumstance would ever arise. This is why I said that this section is not so much of an explanation of “duress” as it is an explanation of what to do if someone dies right before a wedding.<br>If all of the preparations have been made and at the last minute the father of groom or mother of the bride dies, then they put the dead body into a separate room, the couple have their first sexual relations and then they separate.", 
            "This is the continuation of the baraita from above. After the first intercourse, they now celebrate the regular seven days of wedding feast. The mourning is postponed till later.<br>However, this celebration is not complete. Even though they are celebrating, they still do not have sexual relations. Not only that, they have to sleep in separate rooms, being guarded seemingly by other men and women so that they do not transgress and have sex. [Below we will see that this is not normally the halakhah during mourning].<br>Finally, the baraita adds one last piece of information. Even though they are mourning and they are not sleeping together, she still adorns herself. The rabbis were quite adamant that the two of them should not do anything so that she would not look as beautiful to her new husband during their first month of marriage.", 
            "The Talmud reads the “father of the bridegroom and mother of the bride” as specific. These, according to the Talmud, are the main parties who prepare the wedding feast. If the mother of the bridegroom or father of the bride dies, they first mourn, postponing the wedding till later.<br>I should note that this is probably not the simple reading of the baraita. The simple reading is that the possessive nouns are distributive. Instead of saying, “father of the bridegroom or mother of the bridegroom or father of the bride or mother of the bride” the syntax abbreviates it. This phenomenon is found elsewhere in rabbinic language.<br>In addition, I don’t believe there is any reason to assume that it was specifically the father of the groom and mother of the bride who prepared the feast. It could have been any of the four parents.<br>What this does show us is why the rush to get married in the first place. The parents prepared the wedding feast. If one dies but the feast is already prepared, the only thing one can really do is just participate in the feast, despite the emotional hardship this would entail.", 
            "Introduction<br>In yesterday’s section we learned that if all of the wedding preparations had been made and then suddenly one of the parents of the bride or groom died, they have the wedding and first intercourse and then they observe the seven days of the wedding feast. They do not begin mourning until later. Today’s section continues to discuss that halakhah.", 
            "If water had already been put on the meat, then the meat must be eaten immediately or it will be lost. As a consequence, the wedding feast must continue despite the death of one of the parents. However, if water had not yet been put on the meat, it can still be sold. In such a case they would begin mourning and postpone the wedding. Today we might say this is like the catering already getting to the hall. If the wedding cannot carry on, there will be a substantial loss.", 
            "Both Rava and R. Papa limit R. Hisda’s rule from above. According to Rava, in a city, where it would be relatively easy to sell the meat, even if water was put on it, it still must be sold. This means they would never have the wedding before the funeral.<br>Papa says that in a village it would be hard to sell the meat even if water was put on it. Therefore even if water was not put on it, it is still not sold. They would always have the wedding before the funeral.<br>But the problem is that this basically negates any validity to R. Hisda’s statement. In cities they would always sell the meat no matter whether water was put on it or not. And in villages they would never sell meat. So what was R. Hisda referring to?<br>Ashi answers that R. Hisda could be referring to a small city such as Mata Mehasya. Mata Mehasya is large enough such that the meat could be sold if water had not been put on it. But it is too small to sell the meat if water had not been put on it.", 
            "This is the same baraita we saw earlier. The only difference is that a few words have been added so that it accords with R. Hisda. If he put water on the meat the meat is not sold. It is probably cited here at length so that the baraita can continue with another section.  And all these days he sleeps among the men and she sleeps among the women.", 
            "There are two new clauses here. The only clause that is not new is the middle clause, which we learned in yesterday’s section.<br>The first clause states that if his wife becomes a menstruant during the first week of their marriage, they must sleep in separate rooms. We should note that this is different from the normal situation when a woman becomes a menstruant. In normal cases, while they cannot have relations, they do not have to sleep in separate rooms.<br>The other new clause is that he may not have first time relations with her on Friday night or Saturday night. The Talmud will clarify this below. We have already seen another baraita that stated that first time relations on Friday night were prohibited because he causes a wound. Later on the Talmud will explain why this should be prohibited on Saturday night as well.", 
            "Introduction<br>Yesterday’s section included a baraita that taught that if the bride or groom are mourning right after their wedding, they must sleep in separate rooms. Today’s section deals with this clause.", 
            "The baraita taught that the couple had to sleep in separate rooms during the seven days of the wedding feast (when one of the parents died right before the wedding). These seven days are like a personal festival for the couple—both a festival and the wedding celebration last seven days. So they are in a sense keeping a festival and mourning at the same time. The fact that they don’t sleep together is support for R. Yohanan who said that even though mourning may not be observed during any festival, one still observes private forms of mourning. For instance, if one’s relative died during the festival he cannot begin mourning till after the festival. Nevertheless, he does observe some mourning practices, such as the prohibition on having sex.", 
            "Rava says that the baraita’s rule that they sleep in separate rooms is only if they did not yet have intercourse. In such a case we cannot trust them not to have sex, because this will be there first time and we can assume they are excited. If they sleep in the same room, they might have sex. But if they’ve already had sex at least one time, their passion should have been calmed a bit, and they can sleep in the same room. Note, the prohibition of sex remains.", 
            "The Talmud asks the obvious difficulty on Rava. How can he limit sleeping in separate rooms to a case where they have not yet had intercourse? The baraita stated that they first have intercourse and then they still have to sleep in separate rooms despite the fact that it is the first week of marriage.<br>The Talmud now adjusts what Rava was referring to. He was not referring to a case of mourning during the first week of marriage. Rather, he was referring to a case where the woman became a menstruant. If they have already had sex, then they may sleep in the same room (not the same bed). But if she became a menstruant after they were married but before they had sex for the first time, then they must sleep apart."
        ], 
        [
            "The problem with the above resolution is that it sounds like the same exact rule applies to mourning as to a case where she is a menstruant—if they had sex once, they may sleep in the same room. But this is not true, for in the case of mourning even though they had sex once, they must still sleep in separate rooms in the case where they are mourners during the first week of their marriage. This was stated explicitly by the baraita.<br>The Talmud resolves this by adding the words “and he had not yet had intercourse with her” to the baraita. When mourning during the first week of marriage, they must sleep in separate rooms, but if she is a menstruant during the first week of marriage, they sleep in separate rooms only if they have not yet had sex.", 
            "Introduction<br>In yesterday’s section we learned that if he had slept with his new wife after their marriage, he could now sleep in the same room as her even if she becomes a menstruant. This means we assume they won’t have sex in such a situation. However, if he is a mourner during the first week of marriage, even if they have already had sex, they still have to sleep in separate rooms. This implies that it is easier for him (and her) to transgress the laws of mourning than it would be to transgress the laws of prohibited sex during menstruation. Today the Talmud questions that assumption.", 
            "These two sources both deal with the relations between a husband and wife when they are not allowed to have sex: mourning and menstruation. When she is a “niddah” (a menstruant) she can continue to perform the normal household work, but she cannot perform any forms of work that are considered to be acts of affection: mixing for him a cup of water and wine, making his bed or washing his face, hands and feet. This means that we are concerned lest by performing these acts, they will be led to have sex.<br>On the other hand, when mourning she may perform these actions. This implies that we are less concerned that they have sex when mourning.<br>Taken together, this contradicts the relationship between the two times in which sex is prohibited that we saw in the earlier sugya about the first week of marriage.", 
            "The Talmud resolves the difficult by positing that there is a difference between a case where he is in mourning and a case where she is in mourning. The earlier sources about sleeping in separate rooms were a case where he was mourning. When he is in mourning, they must sleep in separate rooms. Evidently he will still desire sex (perhaps as a comfort) and since she is not herself mourning, she will not stop him. But when she is mourning, she may perform actions of affection for him. Even if this causes him to desire her, she will rebuff him because she is in mourning.<br>The problem with this resolution is that the earlier baraita had referred to either of them being in mourning. So how could we limit that to a case where only he is in mourning?<br>The resolution is that the line “the father of the bridegroom or mother of the bride” refers to the other rules in the baraita concerning having the wedding before the funeral. These rules are true no matter who is in mourning. But as far as sleeping in separate rooms, this is true only if his family member died.<br>If some of this seems counterintuitive (for instance that he would be tempted to have sex while a mourner) we will continue the discussion tomorrow. Also there are other versions of this text that reverse the version found in the printed edition (the words for his/her are only a “yod” apart in Aramaic.) There are major problems with these other versions as well, so I have stuck with explaining the version preserved here.", 
            "Introduction<br>In yesterday’s section we learned that if the husband is in mourning during the first week of his marriage he and his wife must sleep in separate rooms. His mourning is not so serious in his own eyes, therefore we fear that he will transgress and sleep with his wife. But if she is mourning, she may perform work that shows her affections for him and we are not afraid they will have sex. This difference between her mourning and his mourning is questioned by today’s section.", 
            "The first baraita states that there are no differences between her mourning and his mourning. In both cases they basically observe mourning together. She does not put on makeup, and they both overturn the beds, a prominent sign of mourning in the Talmudic period. So how can we say above that there is a difference between the two?", 
            "To resolve the problem the Talmud basically adds in a line. When he is mourning, they sleep in separate rooms. But when she is in mourning they need not do so.", 
            "The problem with distinguishing between his mourning and hers is that the baraita explicitly stated “and so too,” implying that both situations are treated the same.<br>The resolution is that they are both the same vis a vis putting on paint and rouge. No matter who is mourning, she does not put on makeup. But if he is mourning, they must sleep in separate rooms, whereas if she is in mourning, they may sleep in the same room.", 
            "The second problem is that the baraita explicitly stated that she is with him, seeming to imply that although he is mourning, they may sleep in the same bed.<br>This too is resolved. “With him” means only that they sleep in the same house. This is confirmed by a halakhah stated by Rav to his son Hiyya upon the death of Hiyya’s wife’s parent. Rav told Hiyya that he must observe customs of mourning with her when in the same house. But when in a separate house, he need not mourn, for it was not his relative that died. What the word “he/she observes mourning with him” means is that they must keep mourning when in front of each other, but not when apart. It does not mean that they can necessarily sleep in the same bed.<br>I should note that this last halakhah is no longer really observed. We only mourn for our close relatives, and when a relative of our relative dies (in-laws) we may act out of great sympathy, but people no longer observe laws of mourning, even when in the presence of their partner. This is part of a long process of reducing the circle of people over whom we mourn.", 
            "Ashi says that the mourning practices during the first week of marriage are different from normal cases of mourning. Since the rabbis were more lenient in that case, the husband might come to sleep with his wife. But in other cases, since the laws are stricter, we have no such concern and they may sleep in the same room. ", 
            "Introduction<br>At the beginning of this amud (half-page) of Talmud there was a complex difficulty comparing the laws of the first week of marriage (if mourning, they sleep apart, if menstruating they may sleep in same room) with other times of one’s life (if mourning she may perform acts of affection, if menstruating she may not). These seem to be opposite, for in the first case we fear that he will sleep with her despite the fact that he is mourning, whereas in the second case we have no such fear. In today’s section, R. Ashi says that this comparison is not justified.", 
            "What is the leniency to which R. Ashi refers? It cannot be that he is allowed to have relations with her before the burial. That is not a leniency since he is not yet considered by law to be a mourner. The tannaim dispute when mourning begins. R. Eliezer holds that it is when the body has been taken out of the house to be brought to the cemetery. R. Joshua holds that it is when the tomb has been sealed with the stone rolled in front of the grave. But as long as the body is still in the house, all agree that mourning has not yet begun.<br>The leniency is therefore that they can celebrate the seven days of the wedding feast before they begin sitting “shiva,” the seven days of mourning. This really is a leniency that might lead to them having sex. They are partying and celebrating all day long, and at night we can imagine that despite the fact that they are also in mourning, they might come to have sex. But under more normal circumstances, the fact that a person is in mourning will deter them from having sex. They can therefore sleep in the same room.", 
            "We already learned earlier why the husband is not allowed to have sex with his virginal wife on Shabbat. The wound that first time sex on Shabbat is considered (by some) to be prohibited. But why should they not have sex for the first time after Shabbat."
        ], 
        [
            "Introduction<br>Today’s section deals with the part of the baraita from above according to which a couple should not have first time sex on the evening before or after Shabbat. As I stated above, I think that what the baraita really means is that one should not get married on erev Shabbat (Friday) or motzei Shabbat (Sunday). Indeed, the version of this baraita in the Talmud Yerushalmi says exactly that.", 
            "Zera says that the reason that first time sex is prohibited on Saturday night is “reckoning accounts.” Rashi explains that if they get married on Saturday night the husband will have to make a big feast that night and on Shabbat he will calculate in his head how much the meal will cost. This is why getting married/first time sex is prohibited on Saturday night.<br>The problem with this explanation is that there are a series of sources cited by Abaye that say that one may reckon accounts on Shabbat as long as they are for the sake of a mitzvah. These sources are a general collection of what is permitted on Shabbat as long as they are done for the public good or for a mitzvah. One should not calculate on Shabbat calculations that are not for a mitzvah. I shouldn’t be talking with people about how much the house costs or car costs or things like that. But if we need to make some calculations in discussing a public good or mitzvah, it is permitted. So this cannot be the reason that it is prohibited to have sex with a virgin on Saturday night.<br>Stay tuned for tomorrow’s section for the exciting conclusion of this sugya!", 
            "Introduction<br>Yesterday’s section dealt with a baraita according to which sexual relations with a virgin is prohibited on Saturday night. But the amoraim failed to explain why this is so. Today’s section is a new interpretation of this prohibition.", 
            "Zera said that if they do the wedding on Saturday night, they might come to slaughter a bird on Shabbat for the wedding feast. I should note that this is in line with the reason it is very rare to have a Jewish wedding today on Saturday night. It is simply too likely that there will be some desecration of Shabbat involved in preparing for the meal.<br>Abaye notes that if we were concerned with slaughtering an animal for food on Shabbat, we should not allow Yom Kippur to fall on Monday (Sunday night), lest he slaughter a bird on Shabbat.<br>Rashi says that if Yom Kippur starts on Sunday night, he will need to eat a big meal during the day on Sunday and he might start preparing on Shabbat itself. ", 
            "There are two main differences between preparing for the wedding feast on Saturday night and preparing for Yom Kippur on Sunday night. First of all, for Yom Kippur one needs to prepare only for one’s family/oneself. It is not such a big meal that one would need to start preparing on Shabbat. Therefore it is not a problem.<br>Second, and I think this is really the key difference, there is a lot more time to prepare for Yom Kippur on Sunday night than there is for a Saturday night wedding. This seems to me to be such an obvious difference that Abaye’s difficulty makes little sense. In my opinion Abaye understood the prohibition as getting married on Sunday, such that the feast would fall Sunday night, the same time that the meal before Yom Kippur would fall if Yom Kippur was on Sunday night. So if one can have Yom Kippur on Sunday night, Abaye notes, why can’t one have the wedding feast. In contrast, the Talmud understood the prohibition as first time sex on Saturday night, which made the difficulty more difficult to understand. ", 
            "The Talmud concludes this section by noting that the same problem of preparing a meal on Shabbat could occur if they have first time sex on Friday night. They will need to prepare a big feast for that night, and they might come to slaughter the fowl right before it is cooked, after Shabbat has already begun.<br>I should note that by the medieval period, it had become the norm to get married on Fridays. People were simply poor and could not take off of work during the week. So they got married on Friday, and combined the wedding feast with the one big meal of the week, Friday night. As tends to happen in these situations, they found various ways to get around the Talmud’s prohibition.", 
            "Introduction<br>The Mishnah stated that a virgin is married on Wednesday so that if her husband has a virginity claim, he can get to the court on Thursday. However, as I noted in my explanation to the Mishnah, the rabbis provide other reasons why she is married on Wednesday (and a non-virgin on Thursday). One of those reasons is found in today’s section, but here it is woven into a sub-question concerning the Mishnah—while we already know she is married on Wednesday so that her husband can get to the court on Thursday, is the sex to occur on Wednesday night or can it occur during the day on Wednesday.", 
            "The issue the Talmud addresses is whether we are worried that he will “cool down.” What this means is that he will find his wife not to be a virgin and get upset immediately. But by the time the court sits the next day he will have already forgiven her, not make his virginity claim and stay married to her. We might very well ask why this would be so problematic? After all, wouldn’t we want him to stay with her anyways, especially if he wants to? The answer is found in the Yerushami which notes that if he finds her not to be a virgin, she might even be an adulteress. If she had sex with another man after betrothal, then she is an adulteress and according to halakhah she may not stay married her to her husband. Therefore, what we are afraid of is that he will forgive his wife for potentially having cheated on him.<br>If we are afraid that he will forgive her, then they should have sex only on Wednesday night, as close as possible to when the court convenes on Thursday morning. But if we are not concerned with him cooling down, then they can have sex Wednesday during the day.", 
            "As an answer to the question, the Talmud cites a baraita attributed to Bar Kapara. According to Bar Kapara, the reason for these specific days is that the “blessing” in the Torah was written on those days, on Thursday and Friday. The “blessing” is “be fruitful and multiply” which was said to the fishes on Thursday and to humans and other mammals on Friday.<br>From here the Talmud concludes that we are not concerned that he should “cool down.” The sex is to occur at night between Wednesday and Thursday, but not for that reason. Rather, the sex occurs at night because of “blessing.”", 
            "If a virgin has first sex on Wednesday night (beginning of Thursday) because of blessing, then the widow should also have sex on that day. So why is her day Thursday night/Friday? The answer seems obvious—the day on which people were blessed is preferable to the day when fish were blessed.<br>We should note that the reason of “blessing” is considered only partial—it doesn’t explain why a virgin is married on Wednesday. After all, if the reason was “blessing” then she should have been married on Thursday, because the blessing for people was said on Friday. “Blessing” only explains why the sex is on Wednesday night.", 
            "The Talmud now brings in another baraita that explains why a widow has first sex on Thursday night, not Thursday during the day. Again, I should note that originally this baraita explained why she is married on Thursday in the first place, not why the sex occurs on Thursday night. She is married on Thursday so that her husband will celebrate with her three days, Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Since second marriages are less celebratory, if he married her a different day of the week, he would go right back to work.<br>But the Talmud again takes the baraita and uses it to explain a side question—when do they have first sex: Thursday during the day or Thursday night. We should note that it is somewhat unlikely that his going to work on Friday will be determined by whether they had sex during the day on Thursday or at night.", 
            " Both reasons “they watched over” and “blessing” lead to the conclusion that a widow is wed on Thursday and the first intercourse takes place on Thursday night. So, the Talmud asks, as it often does, is there any practical ramification between the two? There are indeed two cases where there is a practical ramification. First of all, if the man does not work. In such a case, the reason of “blessing” dictates that he still have first intercourse with his wife on Thursday night, because the blessing to people was said on Friday. But if we use the reason of “they watched over” then we don’t have to worry about him going to work on Friday, because he never goes to work.<br>The second difference is if there is a festival on Friday. In such a case we need not worry about him going to work. But the reason of “blessing” would still hold true.<br>In short, the reason of “they watched over” is not absolute. It changes based on circumstance. But the reason of “blessing” is always present."

            "Introduction<br>Today’s section is here because it begins with another derashah (loosely translated as sermonic comment) attributed to Bar Kappara, the same sage whose derashah was found in yesterday’s section. The topic has nothing to do with the issue being discussed in Ketubot.", 
            "Bar Kappara rhetorically wishes to prove that the works of the righteous are greater, i.e. harder to create, than the creation of heaven and earth. In creating the heavens and earth, God is described as using only one hand. In contrast, in creating the Temple, God is described as using two hands (the Hebrew is in the plural). Rashi explains that the Temple is the “work of the righteous” for in reality it is people that actually build the Temple.", 
            "Hiyya, a sage of Babylonian origin who moved to Israel, raises some difficulties on the notion that God used only one hand in creating the world. Psalms 95 says that God used His “hands” in forming the dry land—two hands. This difficulty is answered by taking note of the defective spelling of the word, “ידו” and not “ידיו.” [Note that the Masoretic text does not use the defective spelling. It is not all that uncommon for the Talmud to refer to a biblical text slightly different from the text in use today.] The defective spelling means that the verse really says only one hand.<br>The second difficulty is from the verb form—the plural of “formed.” This again implies that God used two hands in forming the dry land.<br>Nahman b. Yitzchak solves the plural form by stating that it refers to fingers, not hands. God created the world using one hand, but at least he used more than just one finger.", 
            "Again, a verse is cited to show that God used two hands to create the world.<br>As a resolution, the Talmud reinterprets the verse. “The work of his hands” does not refer to God’s creation of the world—it refers to the acts of the righteous, the righteous deeds that they perform. And who testifies as to the deeds of the righteous? The “firmament” (Rakia in Hebrew, the name of my youngest daughter!) responds to the righteous deeds of human beings by bringing rain. This reflects the Jewish notion that God blesses the world with rain in response to the good deeds done by the righteous. ", 
            "Introduction<br>Today’s section contains another derashah by Bar Kappara, the same sage whose words were the focus of the previous two sections.", 
            "The Torah mandates that people own a peg to bury their waste when they go to the bathroom in the fields. The word for “among your gear” is “azen” which sounds like “ozen” the Hebrew word for ear. Bar Kapara therefore understands this to mean that you should have a “peg” for your ear. If you are about to hear something unworthy, you should put your finger in your ear so that you do not hear it. There may also be something close to the simple meaning of the verse in this derashah. The Torah mandates that we keep our living quarters clean, free from human waste. Bar Kapara adds that if this is true with physical waste, how much more is it true with unworthy words, mental/social waste products.", 
            "This same message is derived from R. Elazar’s question concerning why people’s fingers are shaped like pegs. First the Talmud notes that each finger has a certain halakhic purpose. The little finger is called the “zeret” and it is used to measure a part of the high priest’s breast plate. The ring finger is called “kemitzah” for the priest uses it when taking a fist of the meal (minhah) offering. The middle finger is called “amah” which means cubit, and this finger is used in constituting a cubit. The pointer is called “etzba” and it is used to apply blood to the altar. The thumb is called “gudal” (agudal in modern Hebrew) and it is the finger on which the Torah commands blood to be put for certain sacrifices.<br>Rather, the question is—why are fingers shaped in such a way? The answer is the same as above—so that we can put them in our ears to prevent ourselves from hearing bad things.<br>It is interesting to note that the ear is a sensory organ that is very hard to close. We can close our eyes and we can even pinch our noses shut. But even when we close our ears with our hands, sounds can make it through. This means that we must be especially cautious not to be near unworthy things when they are stated.", 
            "The sugya concludes with two additional exhortations not to listen to unworthy things.<br>I must share a story with you. My grandmother, of blessed memory, was in an accident when she was young, and lost hearing in one of her ears. In my house we did a short, abbreviated birkat hamazon on Shabbat. She was more Orthodox and wished to do the full birkat hamazon. So to prevent getting confused, she would fold up the bottom of her one hearing ear, and insert it in her ear, exactly like it says here.<br>The ear is the softest of the external organs. It is “burned first” which can be taken literally, in that if a person is burned, the ears are most easily destroyed. It also can be taken figuratively. Our ears are always open, making them particularly vulnerable to the harm done by “idle things.”.", 
            "Introduction<br>Today’s section begins a long passage concerning whether it is permissible to have first time sex with a virgin on Shabbat. There were several baraitot (tannaitic sources) cited earlier that prohibited this. Nevertheless, the Talmud, for whatever reason, ignores those sources.<br>The proper place for this sugya is really Tractate Shabbat for it mostly deals with issues of what constitutes forbidden labor on Shabbat. In the Yerushalmi it is found in Tractate Berakhot, for the passage cites a Mishnah from Berakhot concerning reciting the Shema during the first week of marriage. The Bavli brings the entire passage here to Ketubot for it is related to the first week of marriage, a topic discussed in this chapter.<br>Today’s section is an elaborate question, typical of the Bavli, where every possible reason to permit and prohibit are examined. The point of this question seems to be to examine every theoretical possibility in understanding the nature and purpose of first-time sex on Shabbat and whether it should be prohibited. It is an elaborate question, and since it is so highly theoretical, some of the possibilities mentioned might seem strange.<br>As usual, I adopt a neutral, clinical tone in discussing these matters.

            "This is in essence an anatomical question. If the blood is simply stored up in the woman’s womb and waiting to come out, then the husband is not wounding her by having sex for the first time. He is just letting out already-gathered blood, which is not a Sabbath transgression. But if he is opening a fresh wound, then it is prohibited.", 
            "If the blood is stored up in the womb, it is allowed, but only if he just needs to let out the blood (perhaps as a sign that she was a virgin). But if he needs to create an opening to allow future intercourse, then it is forbidden, since it is forbidden to make a new opening on Shabbat.", 
            "We had said above that if he didn’t need the opening, then it is permitted. This implies that if one performs a forbidden act on Shabbat, but did not intend to do that act, the act is permitted. In other words, he intended to let out the blood. It was not his intention to create an opening, but an opening was created. Is this permitted? There is a dispute about this issue among tannaim. R. Shimon holds that in cases such as these, the act is permitted. But R. Judah holds that it is prohibited.", 
            "There is yet another aspect to this question: Is he considered as having damaged or improved? R. Judah holds that if one performs a forbidden labor on Shabbat, but that act was destructive, he is not liable. So if the halakhah follows R. Judah in that unintentional acts are prohibited, do we also follow R. Judah in that destructive acts are not prohibited?", 
            "The Talmud now elaborates on the second possibility from above—first-time sex creates a wound and therefore should be prohibited. However, this is only true if his intent is actually to create a wound. But if his intent is simply to have pleasure, then the wound is a by-product. It is not his intent and therefore the act is permitted.",

            "If the halakhah follows R. Judah and therefore it should be prohibited, we still have to ask whether it is a destructive act or constructive one. If it is considered destructive it is permitted.",

Shimon forbids destructive acts.<br>This concludes the complex question that opens the sugya. As we shall see, the amoraim barely relate to this question. It seems to have been a late addition to the passage, inserted by the editors of the Talmud, as a sort of introduction to all of the legal ramifications and principles related to the particular topic of first-time sex on Shabbat."

            "Introduction<br>Today’s section begins to cite traditions that will answer the question asked at the end of last week’s daf—is it permitted to have sex with a virgin on Shabbat?", 
            "The amoraim Rav and Shmuel debate whether it is permitted. Curiously (or perhaps not so curiously) every school wants to say that their rabbi, be it Rav or Shmuel, is the lenient one. This is noted explicitly by R. Nahman b. Yitzchak, who says that if you can’t remember which bet midrash teaches the debate which way, you can remember that everyone is lenient on themselves. Seems that no one really wanted to deny sex with a virgin on Shabbat.", 
            "The Talmud initially raises a difficulty on the version of the dispute which reads that Rav is the stringent amora, forbidding sex with a virgin on Shabbat. There is another tradition where Rav states that it is forbidden to squeeze back in a stopper into a brewing vat on Yom Tov, the festival. This is because by doing so he will inevitably squeeze some beer out of the cloth stopper, and squeezing liquids out of something is prohibited on Shabbat/Yom Tov. Now this is true even though his intention was not to squeeze out the liquid. His intention was to put the stopper back into the brewing vat. This implies that Rav rules like R. Judah—even though someone’s intention was to perform a permitted act, if in doing so he performs a forbidden act, it is prohibited. So if Rav rules like R. Judah how can he allow sex with a virgin on Shabbat, since this will cause a wound?<br>The resolution is that in the case of putting the stopper into the brewing vat, even R. Shimon, the lenient sage, would prohibit because it is a case where the prohibited work, squeezing, will certainly be performed. This is called by the Talmud a case of “if he cuts off its head, will it not die.” According to Rashi this refers to a case where someone wants to give his son the head of a bird to play with as a toy (they did not have ipads back then). He does not want to kill the bird, just give its head to his son to play with as a toy. But obviously, he cannot give the head to the child without killing the bird, which is prohibited on Shabbat. So he cannot claim that cutting the head off is permitted because it was not his intention that the bird die. This rule teaches that while R. Shimon generally permits someone to perform an action if his intent was not to perform the prohibited labor, if the prohibited labor is certain to occur, even R. Shimon prohibits.<br>In sum, Rav can logically prohibit putting back the beer vat plug on Shabbat, but still allow one to have first time sex on Shabbat. Evidently, the wound is not certain.", 
            "In these traditions a few amoraim relate that in general Rav holds like R. Judah—even when it is not one’s intention to perform the forbidden labor, the act is still prohibited. So how can the earlier amoraim hold that Rav was lenient in the case of sex on Shabbat with a virgin? The same is true with Shmuel—he usually rules like R. Shimon, that if one’s intent is not to perform the forbidden labor, the act is permitted. So how can he rule that sex on Shabbat with a virgin is prohibited?", 
            "Even if Rav holds like R. Judah, he still can allow sex with a virgin on Shabbat because no matter how we explain, the labor is one of damaging. It is not a constructive act, and therefore R. Judah permits it. The explanation refers to the question found in yesterday’s section. If we say that the blood is stored in the womb and he is making an opening, then this opening may still be considered damaging and not constructive. And if he holds that the blood is the result of a wound, the act can still be deemed destructive. In either case it is a wound.", 
            "Introduction<br>We continue to discuss sex with a virgin on Shabbat. I want to reiterate that I realize that these discussions are uncomfortable for some people, but that I adopt a clinical approach to their analysis. I neither condemn practices mentioned in them (I think they were often the norms of the time) nor do I suggest that they should be norms for our times.", 
            "This source is Mishnah Niddah 10:1. The Mishnah is concerned with differentiating between menstrual blood and virginal blood. If the wife menstruates, she and her husband may no longer have sex. But virginal blood does not cause sex to be prohibited. The determination hinges on whether she is old enough to menstruate. If she is, then a longer period is given during which we assume the blood is virginal. For instance, if she is too young to menstruate, Bet Hillel says that we assume that any blood is virginal until she heals from the original would caused during sex. But Bet Shammai says we can assume that the blood is virginal for only four nights.<br>The key to the difficulty raised by R. Hisda is the second clause. If she has reached the age of menstruation he is allowed to assume the blood is virginal for the first four nights. To R. Hisda this means that even if he had not yet had sex with her, he still may do so for all of the first four nights after they were wed on Wednesday, including Shabbat. This is proof that sex with a virgin is permitted on Shabbat."

            "Rava now resolves the difficulty in an entirely different manner. The Mishnah rules that it is permitted to have sex on Friday night with his new wife, but only if they already had intercourse on Wednesday or Thursday night. This accords better with the Mishnah, which assumes they are married on Wednesday and therefore the sex that occurs on Friday night would not be when she is a virgin.<br>If we were to ask why the Mishnah bothers teaching that he can have sex with her on Friday night after they have already had sex on the previous nights, the Talmud notes that we might have thought that sex (or sex with a woman who had only begun to have sex very recently) was prohibited on Shabbat, even though it is not first time sex. This is similar to a different case taught by Shmuel. Shmuel allows one to enter a narrow opening (probably some hole in a wall) even though he will cause pebbles to break loose. This is permitted because the opening already exists and it is certainly not his intention to cause the pebbles to fall. So too, we might have thought it would be prohibited to have second or third time sex on Shabbat, just as it is prohibited to have first time sex. It is not. ", 
            "Introduction<br>The discussion of sex on Shabbat with a virgin continues. Again, an amora raises a difficulty on the position that it is prohibited.", 
            "According to the Mishnah in Berakhot, a bridegroom is exempt from reciting the Shema because he is too concerned with the task at hand (first time sex) and will not be able to focus on the Shema. The Mishnah states without any ambiguity that if he has not yet had sex with his new wife, he is exempt till Saturday night. This seems to imply that he could be having sex for the first time with his virgin wife on Friday night.", 
            "Abaye denies that the Mishnah allows a husband to have sex for the first time on Friday night. He is exempt on Friday night from the Shema not because he could possibly have sex with his virgin wife that night. He is exempt because he is anxious that he did not have sex the first two nights of marriage. We should note that this is an entirely different type of anxiety. In the case where he was going to have sex that night, he is anxious about the act itself. He won’t be able to focus on the Shema because he has something to do (and he’s understandably nervous about it). According to Abaye, he’s just distressed and nevertheless, he is still exempt from Shema. Rava is about to pounce on this notion.", 
            "Rava responds to Abaye that simple “anxiety” over something that already happened is not sufficient to exempt one from reciting the Shema (or observing other commandments). If this were so, then even one who was upset that his ship had already sunk would be exempt. As proof Rava cites Rav’s statement that a mourner is obligated in all commandments except tefillin. He is exempt from tefillin because they are considered an “ornament.” This is based on a midrashic reading of Ezekiel 24:17. Ezekiel is mourning the loss of his wife, but God tells him that he is not allowed to mourn. He is instructed to wear his “ornament” which the rabbis interpret as tefillin. Since Ezekiel the mourner is told to wear tefillin, it seems that other, regular mourners, may not.",

This means that sex with a virgin is permitted on Friday night, and therefore he is exempt from the Shema.<br>The second baraita says that in all cases the groom must recite the Shema on Friday night. This baraita would hold that sex with a virgin is prohibited, and hence there is no reason for him to be exempt.",

Shimon, for R.Shimon holds in general that if one does not intend to perform the forbidden labor, the act is permitted. Here his intention is to have sex, and not to cause a wound. Therefore, the sex is permitted even if he does end up causing a wound.",

Shimon, who in general allows one to perform an act on Shabbat as long as his intention was not to perform a forbidden labor, would allow a man to have sex with a virgin on Shabbat.

Since the forbidden labor will certainly occur, R. Shimon agrees that the act is prohibited.<br>Rava responds that there are those who can have sex with a virgin without causing a wound. They somehow “move to the side.” This is a skill referred to here and in several other places in the Talmud. It is unclear what exactly it is, but it sounds like some kind of gentle way of having intercourse such that the woman’s hymen would not be broken. Since the forbidden labor will not certainly occur, R. Shimon would permit.",

In other words Abaye is saying that if you claim that the person has skill, then the entire baraita about Shema makes no sense.<br>Rava responds that the baraita refers to one who is not skilled. He is anxious so he is exempt from Shema.<br>But, Abaye responds yet again, if this is true, then we should have said that one who is skilled is allowed to have sex with a virgin on Shabbat, but one who is not skilled may not do so.<br>Rava responds that since most people have such skill, it is permitted for all men to have sex with a virgin on Shabbat", 
            "Rava (a different amora with this name) raises a different difficulty. Elsewhere in the tractate we shall see that people were concerned about the evidence that she was a virgin. To ascertain this evidence a sheet was used (this is mentioned in the Torah as well). Furthermore, groomsmen were placed in or at least near the room to make sure that he or she did not fake or lose the evidence. The sheet and the system of groomsmen make sense only if it is expected that she will bleed from the wound that he creates. If most men know how to have sex without rupturing the hymen, then why bother with the sheet or groomsmen?<br>Abaye answers that the groomsmen are there lest the husband tamper with the evidence. They would make sure that the husband does not hide the evidence of her virginity and then claim that she was not a virgin. We should note that this type of scheming husband is already described in Deuteronomy.",

            "A Mishnah from Tractate Shabbat rules that lancing an abscess is permitted on Shabbat, as long as his intention is not to make an opening, just to release the pus. With regard to sex with a virgin, R. Ammi assumes that his intention is to release the blood. Perhaps this assumption is based on the fact that the husband wishes to see the blood as a sign of her virginity. In any case, this Mishnah is used by R. Ammi to prove that sex with a virgin should be permitted on Shabbat.<br>The Talmud responds that anatomically these are different cases. In the case of the abscess, the pus is stored up and is ready to be released. It is not in the walls of the organs. Thus this is permitted because he is not making a wound. But in the case of virginity blood, while the blood is stored up, it is not ready to be released, and therefore this could be considered a wound. Therefore, it may be forbidden, for by releasing the blood through a wound he is performing the forbidden labor he intended to perform."

It does seem that this was a hot topic in rabbinic circles, perhaps for two reasons. First of all, it refers to sex, a topic that the rabbis do seem to spend a considerable amount of energy discussing. Second, it has significant relevance to some general principles concerning Shabbat, another topic that rabbis spend considerable time discussing.",

In other words, these are not theoretical halakhot or discussions, such as those that appeared above. They are concrete rulings. R. Ammi allows sex with a virgin on Shabbat.<br>The other rabbis raise a difficulty we have not yet seen elsewhere—what about the ketubah? Generally, it is prohibited for a man to have a wife without having given her first her ketubah. The rabbis’ difficulty on R. Ammi reflects the idea that they would wait to give the ketubah until after the marriage had been consummated. Perhaps this was done so that he could ensure that she was actually a virgin. We should note that this is not normative practice. In any case, if he has first sex on Shabbat, how could he write for her a ketubah that night, when writing is forbidden on Shabbat?<br>The answer is that he could just give her some movable goods, at least as temporary substitute for her ketubah.",

Papi, and holds that while it permitted to have sex with a virgin on the festival, it is not permitted on Shabbat.<br>Papi then asks what grounds there might be for such a difference. The main difference between Shabbat and the festival is that one is allowed to prepare food on the festival. This includes slaughtering an animal, lighting a fire and cooking. R. Papi assumes that R. Papa makes the following argument. The reason to prohibit sex with a virgin on Shabbat is that it makes a wound. Making a wound on the festival (slaughtering an animal) in order to eat (for a necessity) is permitted. Therefore, making a wound on the festival when it is not for the sake of eating (first time sex) should also be permitted.<br>The problem, R. Papi says, is that we don’t consistently apply such thinking. Lighting a fire on the festival is permitted for the sake of cooking. But it is not permitted for the sake of burning incense. From here we can see that just because something is permitted when done for a necessity is it permitted when performed not for a necessity.<br>Papa responds based on a midrash on the last two words of the verse, “by every person.” The act is permitted only if all people benefit from it, meaning all classes of society engage in it. Incense was something used by the rich, and therefore it cannot be burned on the festival. But sex is something everyone does, and therefore it is permitted on the festival, even if it causes a wound.", 
            "Aha raises a difficulty on the above conclusion that only if everyone is customary to use a certain item can the work involved be performed on the festival (if the same work is permitted when done to prepare food). Deer meat was evidently not eaten by everyone, only by the rich. So using this logic if one came across a deer (not by hunting), he could not kill it to eat it on the festival! This is obviously not true. So, the question is: how come it is permitted to slaughter a deer on the festival?<br>To answer, R. Ashi revises the midrash—if it is something “needed” by every person, it is permitted. Deer meat might be eaten only by the rich, but it is still food, and everybody needs food. Therefore, even though it is rich person’s food, one can slaughter it on the festival. In contrast, incense is not something everybody needs. Therefore, it cannot be burned on the festival.",

The first is a Mishnah from Nazir 3:6 where Bet Hillel instructions Helena the Queen that she should be a Nazirite for another seven years after moving to Israel. See there in my comments in Mishnah Yomit for my information.<br>The second has to do with what makes an animal a “trefa”—unfit to be eaten. If its spinal cord was severed it is a trefa.

If he is a widower marrying a widow, then the blessing is only one day. And if he is a young man, getting married for the first time, then the blessing should be seven days, even if he is marrying a widow.<br>The Talmud resolves this by separating the requirement for reciting a blessing from the requirement to celebrate. This baraita could therefore refer to either a widower or a young man. If it refers to a widower, then he recites the blessing for one day, but celebrates for three.

Hanna of Baghdad concerning an entirely different topic altogether. The topic is whether one can transfer ownership over something to an unborn fetus. According to Shmuel this is possible, but in the end the halakhah is that it is not. One cannot transfer ownership over a piece of property (be it an item or a field) to something that has been determined to not yet “be in the world.” We might put this another way—fetuses do not have property rights.",

Today Jews might get engaged a long time before they are married, but this engagement is not “Jewish”—it has no legal consequences. The “Jewish” betrothal takes place at the ring ceremony, minutes before marriage.", 
            "According to the first opinion, the bridegrooms’ blessing is recited only in the bridegroom’s home, when the wife moves in. This is basically the definition of marriage—the couple begins to live together.<br>Judah says that the blessing is also recited earlier, at the point of betrothal. This seems to be a bit strange—after all, they are not living together so how can they recite these blessings?<br>Abaye answers this question by saying that R. Judah’s statement refers only to the region of Judah, where as we shall see later in the chapter, there was a custom for the husband and wife to be secluded before marriage. Since this seclusion might lead to sexual relations, they should already recite the blessing when she is still in her father’s home.  But in other regions, the bridegrooms’ blessing is recited only in the bridegroom’s house.", 
            "This baraita introduces a new blessing—the blessing over betrothal. Now we can see that there are two separate blessings for two separate occasions, the betrothal and marriage. The first blessing is recited in the house in which betrothal occurs, usually her father’s house. The second blessing is recited at the bridegroom’s house, when the woman moves in.", 
            "The Talmud now relates what we say for the betrothal blessing. God prohibited us (meaning men) from having relations with women we have already betrothed. This is a main feature of Jewish marital law. During the period of betrothal, the woman is prohibited from having relations with her husband, but if she has relations with another man, it is considered adultery.<br>Women become permitted to their husbands at the point of marriage.<br>The blessing uses the curious phrase “huppah and kiddushin.” This struck some commentators as strange because the kiddushin, the act of betrothal, precedes the act of marriage, the huppah. So why are they in reverse order?<br>My doctoral advisor, Professor Shamma Friedman answered this question in an article—shorter word tends to come first in Hebrew pairs. Just sounds better!", 
            "In Jewish liturgy, some blessings are “complex” and some are “simple.” A complex blessing has an opening, “Blessed are You…” and then a closing one as well. An example of this is the first blessing after Barkhu, or the first blessing of Birkat Hamazon, or the first blessing of the Amidah. Kiddush is also an example. Simple blessings have no conclusion. All blessings over things from which one benefits, such as food and smell, are simple blessings. Blessings over mitzvoth are also simple (tallit, tefillin, shofar and many others).<br>So the one who holds that a simple blessing is used for betrothal, holds that it is like blessings over mitzvoth or over things from which we derive benefit. After all, marriage is a mitzvah and people derive benefit from it.<br>In contrast, the one who holds that it is a complex blessing says that it is like Kiddush. After all, it too uses the word “sanctification” so it really is like Kiddush.<br>Today the halakhah is that it is “complex,” like Kiddush, beginning and opening with “Blessed are You…” ",

Commentary and other translations can be found in siddurim.",

According to Rashi, whose commentary is based on the continuation of the sugya, the dispute is whether the second blessing, “Who forms man” is included. We should note that if it is included, then there seems to be a repetition in the second and third blessings. Both seem to say the same thing—acknowledging God for creating humanity.", 
            "Levi who blesses five, would hold that God created (formed) only one human being, a two-sided figure, and then split that being in half, male and female. This is a well-known version of creation that appears not only in rabbinical literature, but in Plato as well. Since there was only one formation, only one blessing is recited.", 
            "The Talmud now says that both R. Assi and Levi believed that human beings were created only once. So how do we understand the discrepancy in the verses, one implying that God created one human being, and then another, and the other verse implying that God created two from the outset. The answer is that God originally intended to create a separate male and female. But in the end, it turned out that God created one human being, and then later separated them.<br>There are clearly deep theological and anthropological implications to this passage. Why wasn’t God’s original intent fulfilled? Why did God want to create the sexes separately? What does this teach us about human beings that they were created at the same time?",

After the wedding, the sheva berachot are recited as part of birkat hamazon and not independently.<br>The customs reflected in this passage are no longer observed. Today, we recite all the sheva berakhot for the first seven days, but only if there are new guests. After the seventh day, no one recites any of these special blessings anymore.

At first Rav Papa answers that we begin saying the blessing when “they put barley in the mortar.” Rashi offers two explanations. The first is that this refers to making some sort of beer from the barley. This would be the first preparation for the wedding. I should note that Rav Papa was known to be a brewer. The second explanation is that they would plant barley in a pot as a symbol of “be fruitful and multiply.” Nice custom, although I might prefer the beer!<br>The problem is that Rav Papa, when preparing for his own son’s wedding, would say the blessing earlier, from the time of betrothal.<br>The answer is that Rav Papa was sure that all the preparations for the wedding were already made. Therefore, he could say the blessing earlier. In other cases, the blessing should not be recited till the preparations are made. Today, since betrothal and the wedding both take place under the huppah, no special blessing is made until then.",

In contrast, Rav Tahlifa lengthened them both, opening and ending them with “Blessed are You.” The halakhah does not follow Rav Tahlifa. The first two blessings are short blessings.<br>We can see here that the precise text of the “bridegrooms’ blessing” was still fluid during the Talmudic period.

In this way, the two most critical moments in a person’s existence, marriage and death, are parallel.",

For the most part, the Talmud holds that amoraim may not disagree with tannaim. If they do, they must find some way to resolve the difficulty (this is what usually happens). No resolution and the amora loses (rare, but it does occur). However, Rav lived right at the beginning of what is considered the amoraic period. He is therefore considered a tanna and may disagree with other tannaim.",

Again, the amora says that mourners do not count in the minyan, whereas the baraita cited as a difficulty says that they do.<br>This time, the difficulty must be resolved. The mourners count when it comes to the minyan required to recite the special birkat hamazon for mourners (we will read more about this later). But when it comes to the line after the funeral in which mourners are comforted, they do not count. This seems to make intuitive sense. In the line, the mourners are separate from the comforters. Therefore, they do not count. But at the meal, the mourners eat just as those giving comfort eat. Therefore, the mourners count."

Yohanan refers to the blessing recited in the plaza. According to Rashi, this refers to the first meal fed to the mourner after the funeral. They would do this in the town square.

I warn you, the eulogy does not contain the kind words you might expect on such an occasion. This story begins a series of “derashot” offered by a person who seems to be a professional eulogizer. It seems that these eulogies are not tailored to each individual who dies, but are more like stock poetic remarks to offer at a funeral depending. At most they are slightly tailored to the circumstance. Eulogies were important in the Talmudic period, but they were conducted very differently from how they are done today, at least in the traditions I’m familiar with from the western world.", 
            "Resh Lakish, the father of the student of R. Hiyya bar Abba does not go to comfort R. Hiyya on the first day of his mourning. It is not clear why not. The next day, Resh Lakish shows up with his “meturgaman.” Sometimes this means “translator” but here it clearly refers to a professional eulogizer. Resh Lakish tells the unnamed eulogizer to say something about the child who has just died.",

God was angry over the sins of the generation.<br>Obviously, the theology expressed here is troublesome to our modern minds (and to the Talmud, as we shall see below). But I’d like to focus more on the form of the eulogy. First of all, it is extremely short. It is basically just a verse, and a short interpretation. Second, clearly the meturgaman does not know the child, and maybe not even the family. This seems to be more of a formal lament, than what we would today term a eulogy. I understand that we today would not want our or our loved one’s eulogies conducted in this manner. What is interesting to me is to look at the record of how they did this in the past.", 
            "This is a second version of the “eulogy” which seems to fit the case better if the son of R. Hiyya that died was a “young man” and not a child. The verse from Isaiah specifically mentions “young men” and blames the person himself for his own sins, and not the fathers, as was the previous “eulogy.” Again, it seems to me that this is a stock eulogy. Scholars say that in the past people tended to have less of an individual identity. People were simply part of a group. I do not know if this is always true, but these eulogies do seem to express that world view. The eulogy is not personal, it matches the person’s age and to a certain extent the circumstances of their death. But that’s it. The eulogizer says nothing about the person’s life. Today in the age of individuality, we would of course expect the eulogy to address the unique aspects of the person who passed away.",

According to this sugya, it is something as trivial as saying explicitly why the bride is going into the bridal chamber. Everybody knows what is to happen there, but this is a private matter. [If you don’t know what happens in the bridal chamber, I am not saying. I don’t want my decree overturned!]. The wedding in essence is a public celebration of something that should be a private matter between a husband and wife. The rabbis were concerned that the private aspects remain as such.",

The answer is that Rabban Gamaliel is the sage who began the wise practice to limit the costs of a funeral. Before his time, burial had become an opportunity for people to show off their wealth. The costs of the funeral became so burdensome that people began abandon their dead. Rabban Gamaliel did not just tell the people to cease this practice. He directed that his own funeral should be simple, and that he should be buried in simple shrouds.

            "Introduction<br>After a long digression about the blessings recited at weddings and funerals or homes of mourners, the Talmud now returns to the main subject of the chapter: virginity and virginity claims.<br>I wish to remind the reader that I adopt a clinical tone when discussing these passages. I try to offer an accurate description of what I believe the rabbis are talking about. The immediate topic of these passages, virginity claims, is not practical halakhah anymore, nor was it observed very much throughout Jewish history. But the abstract principles discussed over the next few pages were of great interest to Talmudic thinkers for many generations, and made this one of the most learned pieces of Talmud in the entire Bavli.", 
            "Rabbi Elazar refers to a completely subjective type of virginity claim, according to which the husband simply says that his wife did not feel to him like she was a virgin. This is different from the virginity claim referred to in the Torah and in earlier rabbinic literature, which was a claim based on the lack of blood.<br>We should note that Rabbi Elazar also refers to a consequence of a virginity claim that we have never heard of before—the wife is prohibited to the husband. The Mishnah spoke about her losing her ketubah payment (200 for a first marriage). In other words, the tannaim referred to a claim that was in the realm of financial matters, whereas the amoraim discuss the issue in terms of personal/religious consequences.<br>What Rabbi Elazar seems to be saying is that if a husband does not have the evidence to successfully prove that his wife was not a virgin, i.e. he does not have any evidence to prove that she did not bleed, but he still believes that she is not a virgin due to his subjective feeling, he may not continue to live with her, for we fear that she was an adulteress. This too is a shift from the halakhah in the Mishnah and in the Torah. In the earlier texts the problem with her not being a virgin was simply that the husband thought he was marrying a virgin. To put it crudely, he imagined he was buying a virgin, and he got a non-virgin, and therefore he wants his money back. Rabbi Elazar introduces a new fear—that she had sex with a man besides her husband after she was already betrothed.", 
            "The Talmud points out that there are two possible reasons considered by her husband not to have been a virgin at the time of marriage is still permitted to him.<br>The first is that she may have had sex with another man before she was betrothed. This would mean that she is still permitted to her husband because she is not an adulteress. Only an adulteress is prohibited to her husband, not a woman who had premarital sex.<br>Second, even if she had sex once betrothed, she may have been raped and is therefore not an adulteress. A woman raped is not prohibited to her husband, as long as he is an Israelite.<br>Since there is a “double doubt” the halakhah should rule leniently and allow this man to stay with his wife, even though he believes her not to be a virgin.", 
            "There are two possible cases where there is not a double doubt with regard to her being prohibited to him, and therefore, Rabbi Elazar’s rule would apply.<br>The first case is if she is married to a priest (Kohen). A kohen may not stay married to his wife if she has been raped. Therefore, we are left with only one doubt—was it after or before betrothal?<br>The second case is where she was betrothed before she was three years old. In this case, even if she had been raped before three, the rabbis believed that her physical signs of virginity would return. Therefore, if her husband senses that she is not a virgin, we can be sure that she lost her virginity after betrothal. We are now left with only one doubt—was it rape or was it willing adultery?<br>As I stated in the introduction above, the actual halakhah here is not what interested Talmudic commentators. What interested them far more was the principle—what do we do in cases of doubt? One principle we learn here is that if there are two doubts, the law can be lenient.<br>I should also note that throughout these passages, the woman does not explain or otherwise respond to her husband’s claim that she was not a virgin. There are some stories coming up later where she does respond. But in the abstract halakhic discussions, we do not know her response.", 
            "Introduction<br>In yesterday’s section Rabbi Elazar stated that a man who believes that his wife was not a virgin when they first had sex, is believed to cause her to be prohibited to him.<br>In a somewhat strange twist, after criticizing Rabbi Elazar for being wrong, the Talmud now criticizes him for being “too right.”", 
            "The Talmud believes that the same principle taught by Rabbi Elazar can be derived from this Mishnah. In this Mishnah, a man says to a woman “I betrothed you” but she denies that the betrothal occurred. The consequence of this statement is certainly not that she is betrothed—after all, she denied that it was true. Rather, the consequences are for him alone. He may not marry any of her close relatives, for according to him, he betrothed this woman. This is the same principle as that which underlies Rabbi Elazar’s statement—a man can say something and cause a woman to be prohibited to him based on his word alone.<br>She on the other hand is not prohibited from marrying his relatives because she says they were never betrothed.", 
            "If Rabbi Elazar had not stated his rule, that a man is believed to say “I found an open opening,” we might have said that he is believed only when he says “I betrothed you” because we can assume that about such a matter he is certain. After all, he knows what he said. But whether she was a virgin or not is subjective; he knows what he felt, but he cannot possibly know if his assessment was correct. Therefore, we might have said he is not believed in that case. Therefore, Rabbi Elazar says that he is believed.", 
            "Introduction<br>The Talmud now questions whether Rabbi Elazar actually said that if a husband says “I found an open opening,” i.e. he believes his wife was not a virgin at marriage, she becomes prohibited to him.", 
            "The Talmud cites another statement by Rabbi Elazar that seems to contradict the “open opening” statement. Rabbi Elazar refers to the laws of the sotah, the suspected adulteress. According to the rabbis, for a woman to become a sotah, and for her to be brought to the Temple to drink the bitter waters, the husband must perform two preliminary actions. First of all, he must warn her not to be secluded with a particular man. Second, she must be secluded with that man. This, according to Rabbi Elazar, is like “the occurrence that happened,” which is assumed later on in this section to be a reference to the episode of David and Bathsheba. This episode is so scandalous, that the rabbis don’t even want to refer to it by name.", 
            "This is not a difficulty, for thus he means to say: A wife does not become forbidden to her husband except in the case of warning and seclusion, [and this we learn] from the occurrence that happened, where there was no warning and seclusion and therefore she was not prohibited.<br>Before going on with the larger difficulty, the Talmud asks about this statement itself. The problem is that the story of David and Bathsheba did not have anything to do with warning and seclusion, and moreover, Batsheba did not become prohibited to David after. The sentence as it stands makes no sense.<br>To resolve this difficulty, the Talmud emends the statement. The reason that Bathsheba did not become prohibited to David was that it was not a case of “warning and seclusion.” [This is entirely absurd—David was not married to Bathsheba, and therefore could not possibly have warned her. What would he have said? Don’t be secluded with me?].", 
            "The Talmud now turns to the original difficulty. Here Rabbi Elazar seems to say that the only way a woman can become prohibited to her husband is through a process of warning and seclusion. We could deduce from here that if a husband says, “I found an open, opening” he would not be believed to prohibit her to him.<br>But this exclusionary interpretation of this statement is absurd. If witnesses come and testify that a woman has committed adultery, it is obvious that she is prohibited to him. So how could we possibly think to say that she becomes prohibited only through warning and seclusion?<br>The Talmud therefore revises the statement (yet) again. One witness as to a woman’s adultery is not sufficient for her to become prohibited to her husband. However, if he warns her and she is secluded, she is prohibited to him even if the seclusion was seen by only one witness. Finally, if he himself claims to have found “an open opening” she is prohibited as if two witnesses saw her commit adultery.", 
            "Introduction<br>In yesterday’s section we learned about the “occurrence that happened” which according to commentators is the incident of David and Bathsheba. Generally speaking an adulteress is prohibited from marrying the man with whom she committed adultery. The question, and it’s not an easy one, is why was Bathsheba not prohibited to David. After all, she was an adulteress and she should not, according to rabbinic law, be allowed to become married to David.<br>I should put this question into perspective. In the Bible while David certainly committed two grave sins (murder and adultery) he was not punished, probably because he is God’s chosen king. The rabbis, though, have to justify David with rabbinic halakhah. This is no easy feat, as we shall see.", 
            "The first answer to this question is not an easy one to read. An adulteress is prohibited from remaining married to her husband. But a woman who is raped is not an adulteress and is not prohibited from her husband. She did nothing wrong. Here, and only here, we read of a corollary—just as a raped woman is permitted to stay married to her husband, she is permitted to marry her rapist (I understand that she would not want to, but technically this would be permitted). So if David raped Bathsheba, he could still marry her.<br>Obviously, this is morally repulsive and also difficult to accord with the simple reading of the Bible. There is little evidence that David raped Bathsheba, beyond the general consideration that the king is powerful and it is not possible for women to refuse him. Indeed, to my knowledge there are no other places in rabbinic literature where the incident is portrayed as rape. Nevertheless, this allows the rabbis to solve the halakhic conundrum of how David was allowed to marry Bathsheba."
        ], 
        [
            "This second interpretation is more normative. David was allowed to marry Bathsheba because Uriah had divorced her before going into battle. This midrash is reflective of the rabbinic halakhah that soldiers should divorce their wives before going to battle. This would prevent her from becoming an “agunah” should he die and his whereabouts not be known. Thus Bathsheba was not married when David had relations with her. Elsewhere the rabbis find ways to justify his murder of Uriah.",

What negative result might happen by his anger subsiding and his not making a virginity claim against her?<br>If the issue is financial, meaning we fear that he will not go to the court to protest paying her the ketubah, why should we care about this? Let him give her the ketubah, even if she is really undeserving of it because she was not a virgin. A person can always give his money to whomever he so wishes.<br>Rather, the issue must be to cause her to be prohibited to him. We fear that he will cool down and stay with her even though she might be prohibited to him, because she committed adultery after marriage.", 
            "The final element that Abaye needs to prove is that this Mishnah refers to a husband who claims “I found an open opening.” There is simply no evidence that the Mishnah refers to such a situation. Rather, it could easily refer to the more normative claim a husband might make, that he did not find blood. Therefore, in the end the Mishnah is not proof that R. Elazar’s rule is correct.", 
            "Introduction<br>In this sugya we read the Babylonian version of R. Elazar’s law. A man who says that he found “an open opening” is believed to cause his wife to lose her ketubah. We should note what a dangerous and problematic law this would be. A husband could make a purely subjective claim, based on no evidence, and use it to cause his wife to lose her ketubah, the money he guaranteed her at the wedding. This law was greatly hedged in later halakhic literature, especially in a series of stories we shall see in the next daf.",

The Mishnah rules that if a husband eats at his father in law’s house before the marriage, he loses the right to make a virginity claim because he was secluded with her. We will learn this Mishnah in a couple of pages. For now, he uses it to prove that while one cannot make a virginity claim in Judea, he can make it in the Galilee, which here is a code word for all other places.", 
            "As we did in yesterday’s section, the Talmud now asks what the effectivity of this claim is. If it is just to prohibit her to him, then why can’t he make such a claim in Judea? After, all, a husband should always be able to claim that his wife is prohibited to him and then separate from her. Indeed, if he thinks she is prohibited to him, he can just separate from her and that’s it.<br>Therefore, it must be that this Mishnah refers to a husband making a virginity claim to cause her to lose her ketubah. Such a claim is effective in the Galilee, or anywhere else besides Judea.", 
            "For this Mishnah to teach the same rule as Rav Judah, the husband must be making a claim of “I found an open opening.” But again, there is no evidence that this is the husband’s claim in the Mishnah. Rather, it is far more likely that he is making the claim we hear about in the Mishnah all of the time, the claim of no blood. There is no evidence that Rav Judah’s rule is found in the Mishnah."

            "Introduction<br>Today’s section tries to find support for why a husband should be believed when he states that he found “an open opening.”", 
            "Rav Nahman points out that it was the rabbis who determined that a woman should receive a ketubah, 200 for a virgin, 100 for a second time marriage. Since they enacted that she should get the money in the first place, they can shape the law such that if a husband claims that he found his wife not to be a virgin, he is believed. In other words, the rabbis giveth and the rabbis taketh away.<br>I should note that this is in essence like saying, “that’s just the way it is” to an irrational law. A husband should not simply be believed to say that his wife is not a virgin. Since he is causing her a loss of money, he should have to bring evidence, as is always the case in civil suits. After all, there is ample reason for why he would lie.", 
            "This section offers a better explanation of why the husband is believed. It begins by questioning why the rabbis enacted the ketubah just to allow it to be taken away.<br>In Talmudic times the husband would have paid for the wedding feast. A husband would not have spent this huge amount of money just to go and falsely libel his wife by claiming that she was not a virgin. Therefore, when he makes this claim, he is believed.<br>We should of course note that this is an assumption. Some husbands might indeed lie about their wives, despite the fact that this will cause them to lose their expenditures on the wedding feast. Nevertheless, it does at least point to a factor in the equation. The husband has spent a large amount of resources in making this wedding happen. The assumption that he would not just throw it away does have some legal weight.", 
            "Introduction<br>In yesterday’s section the claim was made that the rabbis enacted the ketubah, the marriage document that guarantees a woman money at the time of her divorce or her husband’s death. Today’s section questions the source of the ketubah—is it from the Torah or is it a rabbinic enactment.", 
            "A baraita states that since a ketubah is a fine, a sort of penalty on the husband, if he pays out this money, he may give her from the worst land on his property. This is the general rule with rabbinic fines/enactments—they may be paid out from the worst type of land. In contrast, debts would have to be paid out of higher quality land and damages would need to be paid out of the best land.<br>The Talmud emends “fine” to “enactment.” A ketubah is not a fine, it is an enactment of the rabbis, or at least so it was claimed in yesterday’s section.<br>In contrast, Rabban Shimon b. Gamaliel holds that it is from the Torah. The Talmud will now explore this opinion.", 
            "The verse from Exodus refers to case where a man has seduced a virgin—he slept with her without first marrying her with her father’s permission. The Torah rules that the husband must pay her the “bride-price” of the virgins, which in Deuteronomy corresponds to 50 shekels. Since the Torah’s shekel is believed to be worth four dinars in rabbinic/Roman money, this is considered the source of the amount of the ketubah, 200 dinars. The rabbis from here say that this is also support for the notion that the ketubah, the marriage document, is of “deoraita”—toraitic—status.<br>Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says that the status of the ketubah is “from the scribes” elsewhere known as “derabanan.”<br>I should note that the issue of the source of the ketubah is complex. People were getting married with marriage documents for thousands of years before the rabbinic period. The Torah certainly did not invent the notion of the ketubah. And clearly the amount of the rabbinic ketubah is derived from the Torah’s fifty shekels. The argument here seems to be an issue of legal status, not an issue of origins.<br>In any case, this baraita contradicts the earlier baraita, in which Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel said that the ketubah was from the Torah.", 
            "To solve the difficulty the Talmud reverses the opinions in the second baraita, such that Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel holds that the ketubah is from the Torah in both baraitot.<br>However, the Talmud asks why reverse the opinions in the second baraita—why not reverse the opinions in the first baraita such that they accord?", 
            "The answer is that there is yet another source that implies that Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel holds that the ketubah is from the Torah. In a Mishnah found at the end of this tractate R. Shimon ben Gamaliel says that if a man marries a woman in Cappadocia (in modern Turkey) but then divorces her in Israel, he must pay Cappadocian coins, which the Talmud believes to be worth more than coins from Israel. This is because R. Shimon ben Gamaliel holds that the ketubah is from the Torah, and therefore he must pay the debt he incurred in the place where he incurred it, as is the case with all debts. If the ketubah was of derabanan status, he would have been able to pay her with the lesser currency.", 
            "This is an alternative resolution. Instead of switching the baraita’s opinion, the Talmud emends the whole thing, such that it is all the opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel. Instead of him saying that the ketubah is derabanan, he adds that the ketubah for a widow (or any second marriage) is only from the scribes—it is of derabanan status.",

Most interesting is that in none of these cases does the man “win” the case. He always loses, although in various ways. In my opinion this is often the function of aggadah—to balance out the halakhah. The halakhah increasingly believed men who made virginity claims. This may have functioned to deter women from losing their virginity before marriage, at least in the eyes of the rabbis. On the other hand, actually believing husbands is a dangerous thing, for a husband could lie just to get his wife to lose her ketubah. Therefore, these stories serve as precedents that a judge could use to have some flexibility with which to rule against the husband.",

The only way the husband could have acquired such knowledge of sexual matters was to learn from prostitutes. Such a man deserves to be beaten.<br>Note what a deterrent to making a virginity claim this would have been. Sure, come make your virginity claim, but run the risk of being beaten.",

The first is that he is believed, but that they also lash him. This would seem to mean that there is still a significant deterrent to making the claim.<br>The second answer is based on R. Nahman’s assumption that he gained his sexual experience with prostitutes. This would be true only for a young man, assumedly a virgin. If he was married, then he could have gained his experience legally, in which case he is believed and he is not lashed.",

Here, Rabban Gamaliel seems to be saying maybe the man did this accidentally. In my opinion, what he is really asking the husband is, how do you know what you did?

Ashi’s response now implies that virginity claims such as these could not be made at all in Babylonia.

His wife is found to be a virgin and the couple are sent on their way.<br>The Talmud then asks why Rabban Gamaliel had to go through the test with the handmaidens. If this is a “scientific” method, why not just check her right away. The answer is telling—this is not such a scientific method. Rabban Gamaliel needed to prove its effectiveness before testing it out for real.<br>I’ve often wondered whether this whole “test” was an elaborate set-up to prove to the gullible husband that his wife is a virgin. Rabban Gamaliel would make sure that he has ready two handmaids, one whose breath smells of wine, and one whose breath does not. The husband would believe this to be science, and he would go home with his wife. In this way, Rabban Gamaliel would bring peace between a husband and his wife.",

Rabban Gamaliel checks with her family and finds that this is true, the women of her family do not bleed. He now sends the husband on his way, telling him how lucky he is to have married into a family with this genetic quality.", 
            "The rabbis play here on the word “Dorkati” which sounds like “dor katua”—a cut-off generation. This implies that a woman who does not have menstrual blood will not be fertile. [Of course, this calls into question how such a quality could be genetic in the first place].", 
            "Two amoraim here dispute what Rabban Gamaliel said to the husband. Was marrying a woman from the “Dorkati” family a “merit” or a “liability”?<br>We can understand why it would be called a liability—R. Hanina said that such a woman is infertile.<br>But why might Rabban Gamaliel have said, “Be happy”? What is there to be happy about? The answer is that he won’t ever have to worry that he is having relations with his wife while she is menstruating. This was a serious transgression in the eyes of the rabbis, and while I think most would choose fertility, at least it is some consolation. You might say that Rabban Gamaliel was trying to find the silver lining in the situation.",

The wife knows that they have not successfully had sex and that she is still a virgin. Rabbi kindly orders them to be fed and bathed. They are then allowed to be intimate again, and the husband finds that his wife indeed was a virgin. I think this is a really important message for rabbis. Their job is to solve problems, to make peace. All of these rabbis could have ruled strictly.

            "Section one:  This section provides the basic halakhah that will be discussed throughout the remainder of the chapter. Assumedly there are two reasons why a widow (which in this context includes a divorcee) receives a smaller ketubah.  First of all, she already received a ketubah from her first marriage, and therefore has some money already saved up.  Second, and probably more importantly, there was a need to encourage men to marry widows and divorcees.  Most men probably preferred first-time marriages.  Second marriages were made cheaper, therefore, to prevent older women from remaining husband-less.  Needless to say, that people should be married was an important value to the rabbis.<br>Section two:  The Mishnah now begins to discuss exceptional cases, ones which slightly deviate from the typical first marriage or the typical widow or divorcee.  If a woman has been betrothed, but then was divorced before marriage or her husband died before the marriage was completed is in one sense a virgin and in one sense not.  She is a virgin in that she has never had sexual relations, but she is a widow or divorcee as well. [Note that in Hebrew the word for virgin “betulah” can mean either a woman whose physical signs of virginity are intact or it can mean a young woman who has never been married.  The same ambiguity occurs in the Greek word, “parthenon”.]  According to our mishnah, such a woman receives a full ketubah, should she remarry.<br>A “halutzah” is a woman who has been released from levirate marriage, the obligation to marry one’s dead husband’s brother.", 
            "Hana of Baghdad makes a pun on the word “almanah” which means “widow.” It refers to the “maneh,” the one hundred zuz, that she receives for her marriage contract.<br>The rabbis now ask some nitpicky questions on what was just a play on words.<br>The problem is that sometimes a widow could receive a ketubah of more than a “maneh.” As we saw in the above Mishnah, if she is widowed before betrothal, she gets two hundred zuz, under the assumption that she is still a virgin.<br>This question is easily answered—since most widows receive a “maneh,” all widows are called “almanah.”<br>But the next problem is a little more interesting. The Torah uses the word “almanah” and yet it was the rabbis, who lived much later, who determined that a widow should receive a ketubah of a maneh. There is an anachronism here—how can the Torah use a word based on a halakhah that does not yet exist?<br>The answer is that the Torah called her “almanah” based on the fact that the rabbis will in the future give her such a ketubah.",

Joseph explains as referring to the area known as Seleucia, today identified with modern Syria/Lebanon. Just as “Seleucia” is alluded to in the Torah, so is the widow’s maneh.<br>[If you think the analogy is not so great, I agree. R. Joseph is not making a pun based on future rabbinic law, as did R. Hana of Baghdad. He is simply identifying an area of the world mentioned in the Torah based on its future name, just as I identified “Seleucia” with modern Syria.]",

We might note that it’s not hard to find “mem” words considering that one of Hebrew’s verb constructs begins with “mem.”<br>Evidently we need proof for the idea that rain helps the ground.

            "In order to understand this mishnah we must understand a few things.  First of all, all of the women mentioned in this mishnah are assumed to have already had sex.  It was assumed that female captives were raped by their captors and therefore a woman who had been taken captive was assumed to no longer be a virgin.  It was also assumed that non-Jews were extremely licentious, and that they would have sex with young girls (I realize that this is extremely bigoted, but there probably was some degree of truth to it in the world in which the rabbis lived).  Therefore a woman who converted was assumed to have already had sex.  Thirdly, it was assumed that slaves were licentious or perhaps were commonly raped by their masters.  In any case, they too were categorically not considered virgins.  Seemingly all three of these types of women should have ketuboth of one maneh [=100 zuz] and their husbands should not be able to claim that they weren’t virgins, because they were married under the assumption that they were not virgins.  However, the other assumption that the mishnah makes is that if a girl is raped before the age of three, her signs of virginity will eventually heal and return [this medical assumption was not unique to the rabbis].  Therefore if these women made the transition from slave to free Jew or proselyte to Jew or from captive to being freed before the age of three, it was assumed that their virginity would return and they could be assumed to be virgins.<br>A note about the Mishnah’s references to sexual intercourse with young girls:<br>The Mishnah will occasionally reference sexual relations with young girls, even under the age of three.  I expect that this will cause discomfort to people reading the mishnah, and when I think of my own six year old daughter, this makes me queasy as well.  We would do well to realize that the Mishnah’s discussion of all legal possibilities does not imply its tacit approval of them.  The Mishnah discusses many crimes without expressing horror over them, because the Mishnah is often interested in legal consequences. The rabbis certainly did not condone sexual relations with girls this young.",

For an adult this is of course not a problem, but Jewish conversion is consensual. So how can it be done for a child? R. Huna innovates that it can be done by the court taking on the child’s consent.<br>If anyone is interested I wrote a scholarly paper on this subject. It can be found on academia.edu. The point of the paper was to prove that in earlier times conversion was not a process that required a court.", 
            "What you might have said? A non-Jew prefers a life without restraint because it is established for us that a slave certainly prefers a life without restraint, therefore, he teaches us that this is said only in the case of an adult who has already tasted sin, but [in the case of] a minor, it is an advantage to him.<br>The Talmud now analyzes what we would have thought had R. Huna not issued his statement. Conversion is an advantage for a person, for he joins the Jewish people. Therefore, it should be obvious that a minor can be converted in his “absence,” i.e. before he is old enough to consent. So what does R. Huna really teach us?<br>The answer is that without R. Huna’s statement we might have thought that it is not such a pure advantage to convert. After all, many things that were permitted before are now prohibited. R. Huna lets us know that this is only true for an adult who has “tasted the forbidden fruit.” For a child who does not yet know how sweet this fruit is, conversion remains an advantage.", 
            "The Talmud now mentions our Mishnah. The Mishnah referred to a minor convert. But again, we must ask, how can a minor convert? The answer could be through R. Huna’s law—on the consent of the court. This would mean that there is tannaitic support for R. Huna.<br>But this support is rejected. The Mishnah may refer to a case where the child converts with his/her parents. In such a case we don’t really need the consent of the court, for we can assume that the child would want to convert with the parents.<br>In the end, the Talmud understands R. Huna as referring to a child who converts without his parents, perhaps a foundling. In truth, it is not easy to understand how such a situation could actually arise.",

This is completely sui generis in the laws of conversion. In all other cases, once one converts it cannot be undone. Once a Jew, always a Jew.",

The problem is that if she receives her ketubah, and then protests against her conversion, she will in essence get the ketubah and consume its profits as a Gentile woman. Basically, what I think Abaye is really trying to say is that tannaitic sources assume that conversion is permanent. If they thought that conversion could be undone, they would not have given such a woman a ketubah.",

But this does not solve the problem—she could still theoretically protest, revert to being a non-Jew and consume her ketubah while not Jewish.<br>As a result, the Talmud limits R. Joseph’s rule. Once she is of majority age, she can no longer protest. In essence, by not protesting, she is at that point consenting to being Jewish. There is a very limited window of opportunity in which the convert could protest.", 
            "Rava’s difficulty on R. Joseph is basically the same difficulty raised by Abaye, he just uses a different Mishnah. The Mishnah refers to the fine paid by a rapist or seducer. The fine is paid only if the girl is a virgin, but as long as she is Jewish, she receives it. The end of the list in this Mishnah (from chapter three, where it will be explained more fully) is the same as the list in our Mishnah. Again, it shows that a girl can convert while a minor. She would receive a fine because she is considered a virgin, and then she could protest on reaching majority age. Then she could consume this fine while a Gentile.", 
            "The resolution is the exact same as above.", 
            "Since both objections are basically the same, the Talmud now must ask why each amora chose to raise the difficulty from that particular Mishnah and not from the Mishnah used by the other amora.<br>Abaye could argue that the case of the fine is different, because we want the rapist/seducer to pay the fine even if she rejects her conversion. We don’t want him to be rewarded by not having to pay the fine and so we might make him pay even if she could undo her conversion later in life. So this Mishnah is a special case and we cannot use it to prove that she is limited in her ability to protest her conversion.<br>Rava would argue that the case of the ketubah is also a special case. One of the functions of the ketubah is to deter divorce. As long as she has not protested, she remains a Jew and we do not want her husband to easily divorce her. So we might say that in she receives the ketubah even though she could “undo” her Jewishness later in life. This Mishnah is not proof that her ability to protest her conversion should be limited.",

This is either because they have had sexual intercourse but didn’t lose their physical signs of virginity, or because they are not physically virgins, even though they never had intercourse.", 
            "There are three women mentioned in this mishnah.  The first is a young girl who had intercourse with an adult man.  As we mentioned in yesterday’s mishnah, the Sages believed that if a girl has sexual intercourse before three, her hymen will regenerate when she gets older.  Therefore, when this girl gets older she will have her physical signs of virginity, even though she has had sexual intercourse.<br>The second woman is an adult woman who had sexual intercourse with a young boy.  According to the Sages a boy less than nine years old cannot have real intercourse, such that he causes a woman to lose her virginity.  Again, this woman has her physical signs of virginity, but she has had sexual intercourse.<br>The third woman is called a “mukath etz”, literally translated as “hit by a stick”.  This refers to a woman who lost her hymen by something other than intercourse.  In our day we might say she went horseback riding.  This woman no longer has physical signs of virginity, but she has never had sexual intercourse.<br>According to Rabbi Meir, all three of these women receive a full ketubah.  According to Rabbi Meir in order to be considered a non-virgin a woman must have lost her physical signs of virginity through sexual intercourse.<br>The Sages rule that the “mukath etz” does not receive a full ketubah.  The Sages seem to define “virginity” by physicality alone:  one who does not have her physical signs of virginity is not a “halakhic” virgin and does not receive a ketubah of 200 zuz.", 
            "This next mishnah teaches the opposite cases of those taught in mishnah two.<br>Introduction<br>Section one:  The women in this mishnah have been previously married, and not merely betrothed as were the women in mishnah two.  Nevertheless, they are still virgins for their husbands divorced them or died after entering the huppah (the wedding room) before having had sexual intercourse.  Note that this could certainly occur if the woman was menstruating at the time of marriage.  The mishnah rules that although these women are physically virgins, they are halakhically considered to be non-virgins and are treated as such. Their ketubah payment in a subsequent marriage will therefore be only a maneh and not the full 200 zuz.  If their husband in a subsequent marriage marries them and finds them not to be a virgin, he cannot make a virginity claim against them.  One reason that they are considered to be non-virgins is that by definition a woman who was once married can no longer be a virgin, for the word for virgin in Hebrew implies unmarried.  A second reason is that although the woman claims to be a virgin, since she was married, we cannot assume that she is telling the truth.<br>Section two:  The women in this mishnah converted, were freed from slavery or were freed from captivity after the age of three years and one day.  Since it is assumed that in their previous state they had sexual intercourse they cannot claim to be virgins when they grow up and get married.  This is because if a girl has sexual intercourse past the age of three years her physical signs of virginity will not return."

            "Introduction<br>This sugya deals with the status of an adult woman who had sex with a young man, one not fully capable of having intercourse. In what way is she still considered a virgin?", 
            "According to Rav, an adult woman who had sex with a young boy has the status of a “mukat etz”—literally a woman injured by a stick. This usually refers to a woman who lost her  physical virginity through some way other than sex. If an adult woman who had sex with a young boy is put in this category, then R. Meir would hold that she is still a virgin and her ketubah would be 200 zuz. The other sages would say that she is not a virgin and her ketubah would be 100 zuz.<br>Shmuel holds that the category of “mukat etz” cannot include anyone who had sex. Therefore, since sex with a young boy is not considered intercourse, then she is not even considered a mukat etz. Her ketubah would be 200 zuz, the same as any virgin.", 
            "Oshaia raises an objection against Rav from the Mishnah. Since the sages and R. Meir dispute the status of the girl injured by a piece of wood, but not the status of an adult woman who had intercourse with a small boy, the two categories must be different. Indeed, the fact that they are listed separately means that they are different. The implication is there is no such thing as a “woman injured by a stick” who actually had sexual intercourse. This accords with Shmuel.", 
            "Rava resolves the difficulty on Rava by rewording the Mishnah. All sages agree that if the girl is young (under three years old) she remains a virgin for her physical signs of virginity grow back (at least the rabbis believe that they do). But when a young boy has had intercourse with an adult woman there is a dispute whether he causes her to lose her virginity. She has the same status as a woman injured by a stick—R. Meir would hold that she is still a virgin and the other sages would say that she is not.", 
            "Introduction<br>Today’s section relates to the Mishnah where the sages and R. Meir dispute the ketubah of a woman who lost her physical signs of virginity through some means other than sexual relations—the mukat etz. R. Meir holds that she gets a full ketubah of 200, whereas the other sages say she gets only 100.", 
            "The dispute in the Mishnah is only in a case where the man knew that the woman he was marrying had lost her physical virginity. R. Meir says she is a like a “mature girl”—a girl over the age of 12 ½. For whatever reason (I’m really not sure) the rabbis considered any girl over this age to not be a virgin. Nevertheless, there is no doubt whatsoever that she receives a full ketubah. So too, argues R. Meir, does the mukat etz.<br>The Sages say that she is like a woman who had intercourse because she has no physical virginity. Therefore, she receives a ketubah of 100.<br>But, all agree that if the husband did not know beforehand that she was a mukat etz, she does not receive any ketubah at all. Rami bar Hama seems to believe that this is deception, and therefore she loses her entire ketubah.", 
            "The Talmud now explains each of the positions in the Mishnah. R. Meir says that she is like a mature girl because she has never had intercourse. To R. Meir virginity is defined by intercourse with a man.<br>The other sages compare her to a woman who had intercourse with a man because in both cases “something happened.” The rabbis define a virgin as someone who lost her physical virginity through an action of any sort. A mature girl lost her physical virginity without anything whatsoever happening to her. That is why she retains the ketubah of a virgin. But something happened to a mukat etz—therefore she is no longer considered a virgin.", 
            "Nahman objects to Rami bar Hama’s statement from a Mishnah that appears later in the chapter. The Mishnah describes a situation where the husband clearly did not know that she was a mukat etz. If all sages agreed that in such a situation she receives nothing, then what is the point in her saying “I was injured by a piece of wood.” She wouldn’t get anything anyway! The wife’s claim in this Mishnah clearly expresses the notion that she is claiming at least 100 zuz.", 
            "Rava therefore modifies our understanding of the dispute. R. Meir holds that she always gets a ketubah of 200, even if the husband did not know that she was a mukat etz. The other sages say that if the husband knew, she gets 100. If he didn’t know, she loses her ketubah entirely. Note that this means that the Mishnah in which Rabban Gamaliel, Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua debate follows R. Meir. The woman is claiming a full ketubah and the husband is claiming that she had had intercourse with a man and therefore should receive a ketubah of 100.", 
            "Introduction<br>The last section of this daf continues the discussion of a man who did not know that his wife was a “mukat etz”—a woman who had lost her virginity in some way other than sexual intercourse. In yesterday’s section Rava stated that according to the sages she loses her entire ketubah. In today’s section the Talmud concludes that he retracted that opinion.", 
            "In order to prove that Rava changed his mind the Talmud cites a sugya that begins with a baraita. The baraita discusses the case of the “motzi shem ra”—the husband who comes to the court claiming that his wife was not a virgin upon marriage. After correcting the baraita it states two possibilities. First of all, if there are witnesses that she committed adultery after betrothal, then she is an adulteress, and she is to be stoned. This is always the punishment of an adulteress (as well as the man who committed adultery with her). Second, if there are witnesses that she fornicated before she was betrothed to him, she is not an adulteress. She of course does not receive the ketubah of a virgin, but she still receives a ketubah of a maneh (100 zuz).", 
            "Sheshet deduces from this baraita that if a man marries a woman thinking she is a virgin, assuming she told him that she was, and then it turns out that she had sexual relations before betrothal, she still receives a ketubah of a maneh. In other words, despite the fact that she deceived him by telling him she was a virgin and that she had never had sex before, she still receives the ketubah she would have received anyway.", 
            "Nahman uses a Mishnah from later in the chapter to refute R. Sheshet. In the Mishnah the husband claims that she had relations with another man before marriage and therefore his acquisition was a mistake. [The woman’s admits that she had sex before the marriage, she just says it was a case of rape and it occurred after the betrothal. Thus she is claiming that she was a virgin at the time of betrothal, and that she lost her virginity against her will]. The simple meaning of this Mishnah is that she receives no ketubah whatsoever. Again, this is a case where he did not know that she was a virgin, but rather than receive a ketubah of a maneh, she receives nothing.", 
            "Sheshet already answered that difficulty in front of R. Amram and the other great sages of his generation. When that Mishnah says that his acquisition was a mistake, it does not mean that she receives no ketubah whatsoever. She receives a ketubah of a maneh. This refutes R. Nahman who claimed that the Mishnah meant she receives nothing.", 
            "Rava now turns the tables yet again and says that the words “mistaken acquisition” imply that she doesn’t receive any ketubah whatsoever. R. Nahman’s difficulty on R. Sheshet was a good difficulty. [Indeed, this does seem to be the simple meaning of the word]. But still, we now have a clash between the Mishnah and the original baraita with which the sugya opened. That baraita had stated that she receives a ketubah of 100.<br>To resolve this difficulty Rava reworks the baraita. He seems to have been justified in doing so because the original baraita was faulty to begin with. So now, instead of two lines, the baraita contains three. First of all, if she had intercourse with another man after betrothal, she is an adulteress who is stoned. This stays the same as above. If it turns out she had sex with another man before betrothal, then she loses her ketubah completely [so now the baraita agrees with the Mishnah]. She should have told him that she had had sexual relations with a man before this marriage.<br>But if it turns out that she was not a physical virgin because she lost her physical signs of virginity in some other way, then she still receives a ketubah of a maneh.", 
            "Now we see why the Talmud concluded that Rava retracted his earlier opinion, where he had stated that if the husband did not know that his wife was a mukat etz, she loses her ketubah entirely, at least according to the rabbis. Here, Rava states that she still receives a ketubah of a maneh. The Talmud believes that this is the later opinion, and that Rava had retracted the earlier statement.", 
            "Introduction<br>Today’s section is related to the section of the Mishnah that determined whether a woman who had been divorced or widowed from her first marriage but had not yet had sexual relations could still be considered a virgin for a subsequent marriage.", 
            "In this situation, it is quite clear that she did not have relations with her first husband before he died or divorced her. There are witnesses who say they did not. In reality she is still a virgin and she should be considered a virgin for her second marriage. Nevertheless, she is not considered a virgin for her second marriage because she was indeed married the first time. Once her husband brings her into his house for the sake of marriage, she is no longer considered a virgin. Since she is legally not considered a virgin, he can no longer make a virginity claim against her. This is true even if he thought that she was a virgin."
        ], 
        [
            "Rabbah deduces from the baraita that if a man marries a woman thinking that she is a virgin, and then it turns out that she is not, she still receives a ketubah of a maneh. In this baraita the second husband heard from witnesses that she did not have relations with her first husband. He thinks that she is a virgin. And then when he finds out that she is not a virgin, she still receives a ketubah of a maneh. Rabbah thinks that this is true in all scenarios.<br>Ashi says that the baraita describes a special case, one which does not serve as a precedent for all cases. Since this woman had already been married, the second husband cannot expect that she is a virgin. Therefore, this is not a normal case of a woman who is married with the expectation that she is a virgin. In a normal case, she would not receive any ketubah.", 
            "Again the woman in this baraita is married the second time with clear proof that she did not have sexual relations with her first husband. When she turns out not to be a virgin, her ketubah remains a maneh. She doesn’t lose her ketubah. The problem, the Talmud raises, is that she may have had relations with another man after betrothal to the second husband. If she had sex with another man after betrothal, then she should be prohibited to her second husband, as are all adulteresses.<br>The Talmud resolves this problem by saying that the second husband betrothed her and then had relations with her, i.e. married her immediately. In essence this is how we conduct Jewish marriages today—the betrothal and marriage occur one right after the other. And the reason is basically the same. The betrothal period is problematic in Jewish law, for if she has relations with someone else during this period, it is considered adultery.", 
            "This is the exact same sugya as above, but taught in reference to the Mishnah, according to which a “virgin from marriage” receives a ketubah of a maneh.", 
            "The Talmud now asks what difference it makes whether the dispute between Rabbah and R. Ashi is taught in reference to the baraita or the Mishnah.<br>The difference is that in the baraita there are witnesses who explicitly state that the woman did not have relations with her first husband. Thus someone could teach the amoraic dispute in reference to the Mishnah, where it really is not known for certain whether she had relations with her first husband. It is really only her word. We could say that despite the fact that the husband seems to have believed her, he really should not have. She receives a ketubah of a maneh and he cannot make a virginity claim. R. Ashi could say that this is not a precedent for other cases. But in the case of the baraita, where there are witnesses, the husband really should have been able to cause her to lose the ketubah entirely. R. Ashi could not have stated that this case is different in reference to the baraita.<br>But the one who teaches it in reference to the baraita, where there are witnesses, would all the more so teach it in reference to the Mishnah. R. Ashi would always say that the case is different, despite the presence of witnesses.", 
            "Introduction<br>Today’s section opens with a new Mishnah. [There are a lot of complicated historical issues related to this Mishnah and the accompanying baraita. If you’re interested, I wrote a paper addressing them. The paper can be found on academia.edu.]", 
            "The usual custom in Mishnaic times was to wait for up to a year between the betrothal and the wedding.  During this time the couple were not supposed to have sexual relations.  Generally speaking, the young woman remained in her parental home during this period and the husband-to-be was elsewhere.  However, our mishnah refers to a practice in Judea, whereby the groom would “eat” at his father-in-law’s house.  This may refer to an extended stay.  If he should do so without witnesses that he was apart from his fiancee, he cannot later claim that she was not a virgin at the time of the wedding.  Once he has been alone with her, we are suspicious that he has had relations with her, and therefore he loses the right to make a virginity claim against her.", 
            "The Talmud notes that not all places in Judea have the custom for the husband to “eat” at his father-in-law’s home before the wedding. Abaye concurs. This implies that in some places in Judea a husband could still make a virginity claim. This will now be confirmed in a baraita that also implies that there are different places with different customs in Judea.", 
            "There are three sections to this baraita, each describing a custom that they had in Judea but not in the Galilee. According to the first custom, the couple would be secluded for a short amount of time before their wedding in order for him to get to know her. “To become intimate” may mean that they could have had sex, but it is not something of which we could be sure. The point of the custom was for him to get to know her a bit before the wedding.<br>The second custom was for two groomsmen to guard the couple when they enter the bridal chamber (the huppah). The point of this “guarding” is so that they do not deceive each other over matters of virginity. She should not deceive him by bringing in some bird’s blood to fake her virginity. And he should not deceive her by hiding the bloody sheet that would serve as proof of her virginity.<br>We can immediately see that the first custom differs from the second and third customs. The first custom would damage a husband’s ability to make a virginity claim, because he may have jumped the gun. The second two customs were meant to protect his ability to make a successful virginity claim and to defend her against a false claim. This supports Abaye’s claim that there are different customs in Judea.", 
            "The last clause of the baraita stated that a husband who does not observe these customs cannot make a virginity claim. But which of these customs? If it had referred to the first clause, then it should have said, “He who acted” in this way cannot make a virginity claim.<br>And if it refers to the last clause (really the last two) then it is not really the husband who acts this way. The groomsmen are those acting. The clause would be better had it read “he who was not examined” by groomsmen to make sure that he did not falsify the evidence.", 
            "Abaye and R. Ashi emend the Mishnah to read according to one of the two ways suggested above. Only Rava offers a different reading. Basically Rava holds that if a husband keeps the customs of the place where he lives, he can make a virginity claim. The second two customs would serve as guards against the first custom. But only in Judea. A husband who observes the customs of Judea in Galilee would lose his right to make a virginity claim.", 
            "Introduction<br>Today’s section begins a new Mishnah.", 
            "A widow receives a ketubah of one maneh (100 zuz) whether she was from an Israelite family or from a priestly family.  However, the court of priests demanded that virgins from priestly families receive double the normal ketubah payment.  We should remember that in this time period priestly families still formed a quasi-elite.  Furthermore, occasionally the mishnah refers to “court of priests”.  The priests may have had their own legal system, one which derived from the autonomy they had during Temple times.  Priests tended to live in the same area and intermarriage between priestly families was common.  While the Sages did not protest against the custom of the double ketubah, one can sense that the fact that the mishnah mentions that they didn’t protest, signifies some discomfort with the practice.", 
            "The Talmud opens with a baraita according to which the widow of a priest (who may herself be the daughter of a priest) receives a larger ketubah than an Israelite widow. This baraita directly contradicts the Mishnah.", 
            "Ashi solves the difficulty between the Mishnah and baraita by positing development in the history of the size of the widow of a priest’s ketubah. At first a virgin received 400 and a widow only a maneh. This caused the ratio to be off of the usual 2-1 and men treated the worth of a widow lightly. As a response, the priestly court raised the ketubah of a widow to 200. The problem now was that this amount is the same as that of a virgin Israelite. Men preferred the virgin Israelite and priestly widows were having trouble getting married. Therefore, the court restored the earlier system, even though it too was not perfect.\n"
        ], 
        [
            "Introduction<br>Today’s section relates to the Mishnah according to which a higher ketubah was given to a daughter of priests.", 
            "In the Mishnah we learned that the court of the priests would give a 400 zuz ketubah for a daughter of the priests who was a virgin. Shmuel understands the priests as simply being an example of any family with good lineage. He then extends the custom of giving a higher ketubah to anyone who comes from such a family.", 
            "The Talmud cites a baraita as an objection. The baraita states that the higher ketubah may be given even if a priest marries an Israelite or an Israelite marries the daughter of a priest. But from here we could infer that if neither side is of priestly stock, the higher ketubah may not be given.", 
            "The Talmud resolves the difficulty by claiming that the baraita was in the form of a “not only” baraita. What this means is that the baraita did not even need to state that in a marriage where neither side is a priest, a higher ketubah may be given. This is because neither side can claim to the other, “I am raising you up” because I am marrying lower than my “class.” Therefore, a higher ketubah can certainly be given. But I might have thought that if one side is raising up the other, that they cannot also demand a higher ketubah. Therefore, the baraita teaches us that it is allowed.<br>I want to add a short explanatory note here. In the Second Temple period being a priest would have usually entailed a high social status. It seems that the priests wanted to express their social status by increasing the minimum level of the ketubah. After the Temple was destroyed, the status of the priests gradually but not entirely, diminished. We can sense this in this sugya—Shmuel is taking some of the customs of the priests and applying them to other families of good lineage.", 
            "Introduction<br>Today’s section is a Mishnah that begins a series of debates between Rabban Gamaliel, Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua over the credibility of certain legal claims that a woman might make.  The first debates deals with virginity claims, the main topic of the chapter.", 
            "In the scenario in this mishnah, a man comes to court after the first night with his wife and claims that she was not a virgin.  She responds by admitting that she was not a virgin, but counter-claims that she had lost her virginity by being raped and that the rape had occurred after her betrothal.  Both of these claims are essential to her defense.  The fact that the intercourse took place after betrothal means that she did not deceive him by allowing him to betroth her under the false precept that she was a virgin.  The fact that she had sexual intercourse unwillingly is essential if she wishes not to be considered an adulteress.  If she had intercourse with someone other than her husband after the betrothal she would be an adulteress and as such she would not receive her ketubah.  If the court believes both of her claims, then she would receive her ketubah.  Note that the mishnah uses a metaphor for the woman:  she is a field whose top, fertile layer has been swept away, causing a loss to the man.  The comparison of women to fields or houses, as bothersome as it might be to our modern ears, is not uncommon in rabbinic literature.<br>The husband counterclaims that she had relations before betrothal, and that he acquired her under the mistaken assumption that she was a virgin.  It is unclear whether or not he wishes to pay her a ketubah of 100 or he wishes to be totally exempt from paying her a ketubah.  What is clear is that the dispute in this mishnah is financial:  she wishes to receive her full ketubah and he wishes to lessen his payment.<br>Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Eliezer rule that the woman is believed and that she receives a ketubah of 200 zuz.<br>Rabbi Joshua says she is not believed until she can bring proof to back up her words.  In order to extract her ketubah money from him she must prove that she was a virgin at the time of betrothal.<br>The Talmud will explain the underlying legal reasoning behind both of these opinions.", 
            "Introduction<br>Today’s section begins with an amoraic dispute not connected to the Mishnah.", 
            "The Talmud begins with a dispute over a case where one person (Reuven) approaches another (Shimon) claiming that the latter owes him a maneh (100 zuz). Shimon responds that he doesn’t know if he owes Reuven the money.<br>Huna and R. Judah say that since Reuven is certain that he is owed the money and Shimon is uncertain, Shimon is legally obligated to pay him the money.<br>Nahman and R. Yohanan invoke a different principle—until the case can be determined with 100 per cent certainty, no money changes hands. Since Shimon currently possesses the money, he need not pay Reuven back.", 
            "Abaye now tries to correlate R. Huna and R. Judah’s opinion with that of Shmuel stated in a different context. To understand Shmuel’s statement and how it correlates with R. Huna’s we need to first understand this Mishnah, which will appear later in this chapter. The Mishnah is the last in the series of disputes between R. Gamaliel and R. Joshua (the section with R. Joshua is not quoted here). A woman is found to be pregnant, but claims that the child was the offspring of a priest, a person of valid lineage. Rabban Gamaliel and R. Eliezer say that she is believed whereas R. Joshua says that she is not. R. Judah ruled that the halakhah follows Rabban Gamaliel.", 
            "Another amora further says to Rav Judah that Shmuel had stated that the halakhah follows Rabban Gamaliel not only in the last Mishnah of his disputes with R. Joshua, it follows him “even in the first.”<br>The Talmud now correlates the Mishnah with the amoraic dispute above. In the Mishnah, the husband said his wife had sex with another man before betrothal, and the woman says that she was raped after betrothal. The woman’s claim is “certain” for only she can possibly know what happened to her. Her husband’s claim is “perhaps”—for he doesn’t really know what happened. To Rabban Gamaliel her “certain” wins out, despite the fact that money will have to change hands—the husband will have to give her the ketubah.<br>Thus saying that the halakhah follows Rabban Gamaliel in the Mishnah is equivalent to saying that Shimon is liable to pay Reuven in the case from above.", 
            "Above, Abaye implied that R. Judah and R. Huna follow Rabban Gamaliel. The Talmud raises the corollary—R. Nahman and R. Yohanan follow R. Joshua.<br>Nahman now claims that he can draw a distinction between the Mishnah and the issue of the disputed maneh. In the Mishnah Rabban Gamaliel believes the woman because she has a “migo”—which is the Aramaic word for “since.” Here (and in many places throughout the Talmud) it has a technical sense—“Since” the woman could have a made a claim more beneficial to herself, assumedly that she is a mukat etz, she is believed when she makes the worse claim of having been raped after betrothal (such a claim means she can no longer marry a priest). When a person could have made a better claim for herself, she is believed when she makes a worse claim. However, in the case of the disputed maneh there is no possible “migo”. Reuven already made as good of a claim as he could have made.", 
            "There is an alternative reason why Rabban Gamaliel might say that the woman is believed but not the man who claims the maneh. The last certain status of the woman is that she was a virgin. All women are at some point virgins. Therefore, in a case where we do not know when her status changes, she is considered to be in her “presumptive state.” But in the case of the maneh, there is no earlier presumptive status.", 
            "The Talmud now concludes by stating that it was necessary for R. Nahman to agree with Rabban Gamaliel. Otherwise we would have a halakhic conflict, for the halakhah always follows R. Nahman in civil matters (the case of the disputed maneh is a civil matter) and in this Mishnah, as we have seen, the halakhah follows Rabban Gamaliel. In order for these two halakhot not to conflict, R. Nahman must agree with Rabban Gamaliel."

            "In this case, when the husband comes to court claiming that his wife was not a virgin, the woman responds that she did not lose her physical signs of virginity through sexual intercourse but rather by “being struck by a piece of wood”, meaning she lost her hymen in some other way.  According to Rabbi Meir (whose opinion we learned in an earlier mishnah) if the court believes her, she would receive a full ketubah of 200. According to the Sages she receives a ketubah of 100.  In any case, she is claiming that she does receive some ketubah.<br>The man responds that she lost her virginity by having engaged in sexual intercourse.  The phrase “trampled by a man” is an illustrative means of saying that she had sex with a man and not that she lost her virginity from a “stick”.  Assumedly his goal is to not pay her any ketubah.<br>Again Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Eliezer rule in her favor.  The same reason which applied in the previous Mishnah applies here:  since she is certain and he is uncertain, she is believed.<br>Similarly, Rabbi Joshua holds that she is not believed, and that the money remains with the husband.  Again, the same reason as in the previous Mishnah applies:  in order for her to extract money she must provide proof.", 
            "The question is what is each side in the Mishnah claiming? We have already seen some disputes as to what ketubah a mukat etz receives, so we need to interpret this Mishnah in light of those disputes. Clearly this Mishnah is a case where the husband did not know beforehand that she was a mukat etz. Nevertheless, she is claiming some type of ketubah.<br>Yohanan says that she is asking for a ketubah of two hundred zuz, whereas the husband wants to pay her 100. This follows R. Meir’s opinion that a mukat etz is considered a virgin and receives a ketubah of 200, whether he knew she was a mukat etz or not.<br>Elazar says she is asking for a ketubah of 100, whereas her husband does not want to pay her any ketubah whatsoever. This follows the rabbis who hold that she receives a ketubah of 100, whether he knew she was a mukat etz or not.",

Abin who held that even if the husband presumed she was a virgin and it turns out she is not, she still receives a ketubah of a maneh. That Mishnah taught explicitly that she receives no ketubah, because the husband says, “my acquisition was a mistake.” The second Mishnah excludes the opinion of Rami b. Hama who held that if the husband did not know she was a mukat etz, she receives no ketubah whatsoever. The fact that she claims she was a mukat etz in this Mishnah obviously means that she is claiming at least 100.<br>That works for R. Elazar. But R. Yohanan agrees with R. Hiyya b. Abin. So why does he need two mishnayot?", 
            "Yohanan would explain the need for two mishnayot based on the legal principle of “migo” which, as we have seen, means that when one makes a lesser claim despite the possibility of making a better claim, the lesser claim is believed. In the first Mishnah, the woman had a “migo”—she could have said “I am a mukat etz” instead of saying that, she says she was raped after betrothal. This is a worse claim because it disqualifies her from a marrying a priest. Nevertheless, R. Joshua does not believe her. This Mishnah shows us the strength of R. Joshua’s position; he does not believe her claim even in the presence of a “migo.”<br>Rabban Gamaliel believes her in the second Mishnah, where she claims “I was a mukat etz” even though in this case she has no “migo.” She has made the best claim she could possibly make.", 
            "Introduction<br>Today’s section opens with another Mishnah, with two sections. In both sections, Rabban Gamaliel and R. Eliezer dispute whether the woman is believed. I should emphasize that these mishnayot have nothing to do with virginity claims.", 
            "In the Talmud below there is debate over what the woman was seen doing.  According to some, she was seen having intercourse with an unknown man, and that “talking” is a euphemism for sex.  Others say that she was merely talking with him, but there was suspicion that they had had sex.  It is important to remember that the situation is that she is a single woman and there is no issue of adultery.  However, if she had had relations with a man who was forbidden from marrying an Israelite, such as a mamzer or a natin, she would subsequently be prohibited from marrying a priest.  When asked who this man was she provides his name and says that he is a priest.  Note that it is not essential that he is a priest; it is sufficient that he is a man who is not prohibited from marrying an Israelite.<br>Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Eliezer again rule that the woman is believed and may subsequently marry a priest.  Since she has a presumption of being fit to marry a priest, it requires solid evidence to remove her from this presumption.<br>Rabbi Joshua holds that since she was secluded with him, she loses her presumption of being fit to marry a priest.  She must bring proof that this person was not prohibited from marrying an Israelite and until then she may not marry a priest.", 
            "This section of the mishnah is nearly identical to the section above, the only difference being that this woman is pregnant.  The reason why the mishnah reiterates the positions outlined in the previous mishnah is to teach that Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Eliezer believe the woman even if she is pregnant.  In the previous dispute, it was unclear whether or not she had even had sex with the man in question.  When asked who he was, she could have said that she never had relations with him.  Therefore, when she admitted that she did but said that she was a priest (i.e. one who is allowed to marry an Israelite), she is believed.  However, in this section it is certain that she had relations with someone and she could not make a better claim than to say that the man was fit to marry an Israelite. Nevertheless, Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Eliezer hold that she is believed.<br>A further innovation is that not only is the woman believed, and she is subsequently allowed to marry a priest, but her child is assumed to be fit to marry an Israelite.  In other words, even though we don’t know for sure that the child is not a mamzer or a natin, the law treats him/her as if he was not.<br>Rabbi Joshua again states that the woman is not believed. Furthermore, her child is assumed to be the child of a natin or a mamzer and may not marry an Israelite until s/he proves otherwise.", 
            "Ze’iri understands the “talking” in the Mishnah to refer to her being secluded with an unknown man. But according to R. Assi she was seen actually having intercourse. So then why does the Mishnah say that she was seen talking? The answer is that “talking” can be a euphemism for sex. The Talmud cites another euphemism, this time from the book of Proverbs. This verse refers to an adulterous woman.", 
            "The Talmud now asks why we need two mishnayot that are so similar to each other. For Ze’iri this is not a problem, because he interprets the first Mishnah to refer to a case where she was only secluded. R. Joshua says she is disqualified from marrying a priest even in this case. And Rabban Gamaliel would declare her fit even if she is known to have had sex with another man. So both mishnayot are necessary.<br>Assi cannot use this reason, because he interprets “talking” to refer to sex. Therefore in both mishnayot it is clear that she had sex with an unknown man. So R. Assi offers another reason for the necessity of two mishnayot. The first declares her to be fit to marry a priest (according to Rabban Gamaliel), and the second, in which she is pregnant, teaches that her child is also fit to marry a priest.", 
            "Below we will see a dispute whether the one who declares the woman herself to be fit, also declares her offspring to be fit. R. Assi, who says that one Mishnah teaches, that she is fit and the other teaches that her offspring is fit, would have to agree with the one who holds that if she is fit, her daughter is fit as well.", 
            "Introduction<br>In yesterday’s section Ze’iri interpreted “talking” in the Mishnah to mean “being secluded.” The woman in the Mishnah is being accused of being secluded with a strange man. R. Assi interpreted it to mean that she was seen actually having sex. Today’s section continues that discussion.", 
            "Ze’iri’s interpretation of the Mishnah implies that R. Joshua would not allow a woman who had been secluded with an unknown man to subsequent marry a Kohen. This clashes with a statement made by the amora, Rav. Rav said that if a wife is secluded with a man who is not her husband she does receive the punishment of lashes (I know this bothers people, but it probably is just the way the rabbis say that she has transgressed. It does not mean they actually did this). Nevertheless, she is not prohibited from staying with her husband. This means that Rav does not think she actually had sex with the other man. So does Rav contradict R. Joshua, who does not believe her?<br>The resolution is that there is a difference between marrying into the priesthood, the topic of the Mishnah, and remaining married to one’s husband, the topic of Rav’s statement. When it comes to marrying into the priesthood, the rabbis were strict. Even seclusion with a strange man would disqualify her.  But when it comes to remaining with her husband, there needs to be more evidence that she was an adulteress for her to be prohibited.", 
            "This baraita is basically the same as the Mishnah except here instead of her being seen “talking” with someone, she is seen entering into a hidden place or into a ruin. The Talmud will now explain that this baraita is a difficulty on R. Assi who interpreted “talking” in the Mishnah to mean that she was seen having intercourse."

            "Introduction<br>Today’s section brings a baraita to refute R. Assi who had interpreted “talking” in the Mishnah as the woman being seen having sexual intercourse.", 
            "This is a long baraita which relates to the situation in the Mishnah—a woman is pregnant, but we do not know who the father was. The first opinion, which follows Rabban Gamaliel, says that a woman is believed when she says that the father was a fit person, meaning he had proper lineage. R. Joshua says she is not believed. He argues from the case of a woman who was captured, a topic we will return to later. The assumption is that she was raped by her captors and therefore she is forbidden from subsequently marrying a priest. R. Joshua says that the case of the woman who is pregnant is the same—she is not believed. The rabbis say that the case of the captive woman is different, for there we have witnesses that she was taken captive. R. Joshua responds that her pregnancy is clear testimony that she had sex.<br>The other rabbis now try to draw another distinction between the two cases. The captive woman was taken captive by non-Jews, who we assume are unrestrained in sexual matters. But the woman who is pregnant was not necessarily among a group of non-Jews, and therefore it is more likely that she had relations with someone permitted to her.<br>Finally, the baraita adds an important caveat. She is only believed with regard to herself. But with regard to her offspring, she is not believed. Therefore the offspring must be considered a “shetuki” a child whose father is not known.", 
            "The Talmud now explains some of the dialogue in the baraita. The main thing is that the Talmud adds a shift in topic into the middle of the baraita. At first the rabbis admit to R. Joshua that he successfully responded with regard to the pregnant woman. Such a woman is indeed like a captive woman in that we can be sure she had intercourse. But what about a woman seen “talking” meaning secluded.<br>Joshua responds that there is no “guardian in sexual matters,” which means that after they have been secluded, we can assume they had sex.", 
            "Assi had interpreted “talking” as her being seen having intercourse. In his opinion, if she is only seen secluded with an unknown man, R. Joshua would not prohibit her from marrying a priest. But this baraita clearly teaches two different cases, one where she is seen talking and one where she is pregnant. Therefore, R. Assi’s opinion is refuted. ", 
            "Introduction<br>This section continues the discussion from in yesterday’s baraita, comparing a woman taken captive with the woman found pregnant by an unknown man.", 
            "The rabbis did not respond to R. Joshua that when she was taken captive most of the captors would have been men who would disqualify her if they had sex with her (non-Jews).  But when it comes to the pregnant woman, most men would not disqualify her.<br>The fact that the baraita does not mention this difference (at least not explicitly) supports R. Joshua ben Levi who says that it really does not matter whether the majority of men were fit or unfit. R. Joshua says that she is not believed and Rabban Gamaliel says that she is.", 
            " Introduction<br>The Mishnah contained a dispute between Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Eliezer whether a woman who was pregnant from a man whose identity is unknown is still fit to marry a priest. Rabban Gamaliel says she is believed to say that the man was a priest (and therefore she is fit) and Rabbi Joshua says she is not believed. Our sugya deals with the status of the offspring.", 
            "Yohanan says that the opinions in the Mishnah concerning the woman herself also apply to her offspring. Rabban Gamaliel would say that just as she is fit, so is her offspring. And of course, Rabbi Joshua disqualifies her offspring, just as he disqualifies her (from marrying a priest).<br>Elazar though makes a distinction, one explained by Rabbah. The mother was born fit to marry a priest. This gives her a presumption, a hazakah, of fitness. In order to remove someone from their hazakah, we need solid proof, which in this case is lacking. However, the child has no such hazakah; from its birth it was not known what its status was. Therefore, even Rabban Gamaliel would admit that the child may not marry a priest (if it is a girl).", 
            "Elazar uses the end of the baraita found in yesterday’s section as a difficulty on R. Yohanan. The baraita seemed to explicitly state that only the woman herself was fit. The offspring is definitely unfit, a shetuki, which means one whose father is unknown.<br>Yohanan resolves this by saying that while the child is a “shetuki,” she is still fit to marry a priest. This is an innovative reading of the word, which the Talmud will now need to explain.", 
            "The Talmud reinterprets the meaning of “shetuki.” A child whose father is not known is not considered a priest, even if we can be sure that his father was a priest. To be a priest one would need to know exactly who one’s father is. But if this child is a girl, she is still fit to marry into the priesthood. In other words, the mother is believed to say that the father was fit. The child too is fit. But there is no way we can consider the child a priest.", 
            "Introduction<br>As often happens the abstract discussion of the halakhah is followed by some actual case law. In today’s case a betrothed woman comes in front of a rabbi with her fiancée.", 
            "The woman who comes in front of R. Joseph with her fiancée is not yet married. Nevertheless, she’s pregnant (it happens now and it happened then). The issue is can we be certain that the child is his. R. Joseph says that since the fiancée says it is his, and since the halakhah follows Rabban Gamaliel who said she is believed, we can certainly believe this particular pregnant woman."
