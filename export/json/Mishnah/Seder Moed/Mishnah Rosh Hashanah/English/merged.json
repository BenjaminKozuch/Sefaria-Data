            "The four new years are: On the first of Nisan, the new year for the kings and for the festivals; On the first of Elul, the new year for the tithing of animals; Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Shimon say, in the first of Tishrei. On the first of Tishrei, the new year for years, for the Sabbatical years and for the Jubilee years and for the planting and for the vegetables. On the first of Shevat, the new year for the trees, these are the words of the House of Shammai; The House of Hillel says, on the fifteenth thereof.", 
            "At four times the world is judged: On Pesach, for the crops. On Shavuot, for the fruits of the tree. On Rosh Hashnah, all the world passes before Him like sheep, as it says, \"He that fashioneth the hearts of them all, that considereth all their doings.\" (Psalms 33:15) And on Sukkot, they are judged for the water.", 
            "On six months messengers go out: On Nisan, because of Pesach; On Av, because of the fast On Elul, because of Rosh Hashnanah; On Tishrei, to correct for the festivals On Kislev, because of Chanukah; On Adar, because of Purim; And when the Temple existed, they also went out on Iyar, because of the little Pesach.", 
            "On two months they desecrate the Shabbat, on Nisan and on Tishrei. For in those months, they were sent out to Syria to correct for the festivals. And when the Temple existed, they desecrated Shabbat in all of them-- To correct for the sacrifices.", 
            "Regardless of whether the moon was clearly visible or not clearly visible, They desecrate the Shabbat for it; Rabbi Yosei says: If it was clearly visible, they do not desecrate the Shabbat for it.", 
            "It happened once, that more than forty pair of witnesses passed through on the Sabbath, when R. Akivah detained them at Lydda [‏לוד‎]; Rabbon Gamaliel then sent word, saying, \"If thou thus detainest the people, thou wilt be the cause of their straying in future\" [they will refuse to come].", 
            "When father and son have seen the new moon, they must both go to the tribunal of judgment [Beth Din], not that they may be combined together to act as witnesses, but in order that, should the evidence of either of them be invalidated, the other may join to give evidence with another witness. R. Simeon says, \"Father and son, and relatives in every degree, may be allowed as competent witnesses to give evidence as to the appearance of the new moon.\" R. José says, \"It once happened that Tobias the physician, his son, and his freed slave, saw the new moon in Jerusalem, [and when they tendered their evidence] the priests accepted his evidence, and that of his son, but invalidated that of his freed slave; but when they appeared before the 'Beth Din,' they received his evidence, and that of his freed slave, but invalidated that of his son.\"", 
            "The following are considered incompetent witnesses: gamblers with dice, usurers, pigeon breeders, those who trade in the produce of the Sabbatical year, and also slaves. The rule is, that all evidence that cannot be received from a woman cannot be received from any of these.", 
            "A person who has seen the new moon, but is unable to go [to give evidence], must be brought [if unable to walk] mounted on an asses or even in a bed. Persons afraid of being waylaid by robbers may take sticks with them; and if they have a long way to go, it will be lawful for them to provide for themselves, and carry their food. Whenever [witnesses] must be a day and a night on the road, it will be lawful to profane the Sabbath to travel thereon, to give their evidence as to the appearance of the new moon. For thus is it written (Lev. 23:4), \"These are the feasts of the Lord, the holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their appointed seasons.\""

            "\tIf they do not recognize him [i.e., if beth-din do not recognize the witness as being trustworthy and kasher, they [the beth-din in the witness's city] send another [pair of witnesses] with him to testify about him [before the great beth-din who sanctify the New Moon.] In the beginning, they would accept testimony to the (appearance of) the new moon from all men. When the heretics attempted to undermine (the institution of the New Moon) [by hiring false witnesses to deceive the sages], they ordained that only recognized (witnesses) be accepted.", 
            "\tIn the beginning, they would light beacons [to inform those at a distance that the month had been sanctified, and they did not have to hire messengers to send them to the exile to apprise them, for they would be apprised by the beacons.] When the Cuthites attempted to undermine (the institution of the New Moon) [and they, too, lit beacons at the wrong time, to deceive them], they ordained that messengers go out [For beth-din would light beacons only for a month which was sanctified on the thirtieth day; and if they did not light them on the eve of the thirtieth day, all knew that the month was full. And once beth-din intercalated the month and did not light beacons on the eve of the thirtieth day — and the Cuthites lit them in their hills and deceived the Jews in the exile into making the month defective (instead of full)].", 
            "\tHow did they light the beacons? They brought long cedar beams [which would be seen from afar], and reeds, and oil-wood, and hatchelled flax [to increase the flame], and one would tie them all together with a rope and go up to the top of the mountain and light it, and move it from side to side and up and down until he saw his friend (i.e., his counterpart) doing so on top of the second mountain; and so, on top of the third mountain, etc.", 
            "\tAnd from where did they light the beacons? From the Mount of Olives [facing Jerusalem in the east] to Sarteva, and from Sarteva to Grofina, and from Grofina to Chavran, and from Chavran to Beth Biltin, and from Beth Biltin — they did not leave — but he moved it (the beacon) from side to side and up and down until he saw the entire exile [Bavel] (lit) before him as a bonfire. [For each one would take a torch and bring it up to his roof.]", 
            "\tThere was a big courtyard in Jerusalem called Beth Ya'azek, where all the witnesses congregated and where beth-din examined them. And they would make large feasts for them so that they would be encouraged to come. In the beginning, they [the witnesses, who had left their tchum on Shabbath and had come to testify] did not move from there the entire day, [for one who leaves the tchum may walk only four cubits (outside it)], whereupon R. Gamliel the Elder instituted that they be permitted to go two thousand cubits in every direction. And not only they — but also a midwife who came to deliver (outside the tchum), one fleeing a fire, or (one fleeing) an armed troop, an overflow, or a cave-in, are regarded as the people of the city and may go two thousand cubits in every direction.", 
            "\tHow are the witnesses examined? The pair to arrive first is examined first. The senior (of the pair) is brought in first, and asked: \"How did you see the moon? Facing the sun, or behind the sun?\" [i.e., Was the crescent of the moon inclining towards the sun or in a different direction? And in this regard it is stated below: \"If he said that it was facing the sun, he has said nothing\"; for the luminous side of it always is towards the sun and the crescent side, away from it], \"In the north or in the south?\" [For the moon moves away from the sun, sometimes to the north, sometimes to the south. And if beth-din knew, by calculation, that at that time it should be towards the north and the witnesses said they saw it towards the south, or vice versa, of a certainty, they are false witnesses.], \"How high was it?\" [above the earth, as you saw it? If one of them said two (men's) heights, and the other, three, their testimony is accepted. If one said three, and the other, five, their testimony is rejected.], \"And whither did it incline?\" [i.e., In which direction did the heads of the crescent incline, north or south?], And how broad was it?\" [For the size of the moon (to the eye) varies as to its distance from the sun.] If he said that it was facing the sun, he has said nothing. Then they would bring in the second witness and examine him. If their statements jibed, their testimony was accepted. And the other pairs were asked general questions. Not because they were needed, but so that they not leave disconsolate, to encourage them to come again.", 
            "\tThe head of beth-din says: \"It is sanctified,\" [it being written (Leviticus 23:44): \"And Moses declared the festivals of the L-rd\" — whence it is derived that the head of beth-din says: \"It is sanctified.\"], and all the people respond: \"It is sanctified; it is sanctified,\" [it being written (Ibid. 3): \"…the festivals of the L-rd which you shall call them\" (otham) — read it \"atem\" (\"you\"), it being written without the vav (i.e., you declare the New Moon). (\"It is sanctified; it is sanctified\":) twice, it being written (Ibid.): \"callings of holiness,\" two callings.] Whether it is seen in its time [on the night of the thirtieth] or not seen in its time, it is sanctified. R. Elazar b. Tzaddok says: If it is not seen in its time, [and the night of Rosh Chodesh is set as the night of the thirty-first], it is not sanctified, having already been sanctified by Heaven. [For the sanctification of the moon is not obligatory, it being written (Ibid. 25:10): \"And you shall sanctify the fiftieth year\" — You sanctify years (it being incumbent upon beth-din to say that the month is sanctified in the year of the Jubilee), but you do not sanctify months, (it not being incumbent upon beth-din to say that the month is sanctified. And when it is seen in its time, it is sanctified because it requires \"strengthening.\" The halachah is in accordance with R. Elazar b. R. Tzaddok.]", 
            "\tR. Gamliel had figures of the different forms of the moon, [depicting the size of the moon and the direction of the inclination of its rays], which he would show to those unversed (in technical terminology, who came to testify to the appearance of the new moon), asking them: \"Did it look like this or like this?\" Once, two witnesses came and said: \"We saw it in the morning in the east, and in the evening in the west.\" R. Yochanan b. Nuri said: They are false witnesses. And when they came to Yavneh, R. Gamliel accepted their testimony. [Not because he thought that it was possible to see the moon in the morning in the east at the beginning of sunrise, and, in the same day, to see it in the west at sunset. For this is impossible. Rather, he accepted their testimony as to having seen the moon in the west in the evening, knowing, by calculation, that this was a possibility for that night. As to their saying that they had seen it in the morning in the east, he assumed that they had been deceived by having seen clouds in the form of the moon in the firmament. As it is taught in the baraitha (25a): \"Once the skies were clouded over and the form of the moon appeared on the twenty-ninth of the month, etc.\" And R. Yochanan b. Nuri, who called them \"false witnesses\" — According to his calculation it was impossible for the witnesses to have seen the moon that night, there not having been enough time between their sighting and the molad (\"birth\" of the moon) for them to have seen it. And on this account R. Gamliel counters in the baraitha: \"Thus have I received it from my father's father's house: Sometimes it comes longer; sometimes it comes shorter.\" That is, the time between the molad and the appearance of the moon is not always the same. For sometimes the movement of the moon is faster, and, sometimes, slower. And by the speed of the moon's movement at that time, R. Gamliel calculated that the moon could have been seen on that night, for which reason he accepted their testimony.] On another occasion, two witnesses came and testified: \"We saw it in its (regular) time [the night of the thirtieth], but it was not visible on the night of its fullness\" [the night of the thirty-first], and R. Gamliel accepted their testimony. [Not because he assumed that the moon moved away from the sun on the night of the thirtieth, so as to be visible, and then turned back towards the sun on the night of the thirty-first, so that it was concealed. For the moon does not turn back, but moves continuously in its orbit. Rather, R. Gamliel knew by calculation that on that night when the witnesses claimed to have seen it, the moon had already moved far enough from the sun to be visible, for which reason he accepted their testimony. As to their saying: \"but it was not visible on the night of its fullness,\" it is possible that it had been covered by the clouds or that they could not see it because of some other reason.] R. Dossa b. Hyrcanus said: \"They are false witnesses. It is like testifying about a woman that she has given birth, and the next morning finding her belly between her teeth!\" R. Yehoshua said: \"I accept your words\" [to intercalate the month].", 
            "\tR. Gamliel (the Nassi) sent to him (R. Yehoshua): \"I decree that you come to me with your staff and your money on the day that Yom Kippur falls out according to your reckoning.\" R. Akiva went and found him (R. Yehoshua) desponding [over the Nassi's having decreed that he desecrate Yom Kippur], whereupon he said to him: There is Biblical support for regarding everything done by R. Gamliel as done (i.e., taking effect), it being written (Leviticus 23:4): These are the festivals of the L-rd, callings of holiness, which you shall call them\" — Whether (you proclaim them) in their times or not in their times, I have no festivals but these [Scripture making the \"callings\" of beth-din the criterion (for the determination of the festival times)]. When he [R. Yehoshua] came to R. Dossa b. Hyrcanus, he said to him: If we took exception with the beth-din of R. Gamliel, we would have to do so with every beth-din which arose for Israel from Moses' time until now, viz. (Exodus 24:9): \"And there went up Moses and Aaron, Nadav and Avihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel\": Why were the names of the elders not given? To teach that any three who are set up as a beth-din over Israel are equivalent to that of Moses himself. [So that if one questions the authority of a beth-din in his day, saying: \"Are they as great as Moses and Aaron or Eldad and Medad?\" he is told: \"Perhaps he is as great as the remaining ones, whose names were not given.\"] He, thereupon, took his staff and his money in his hand and went to Yavneh to R. Gamliel on the day that Yom Kippur fell out according to his (R. Yehoshua's) reckoning. (When he got there,) R. Gamliel arose and kissed him on his head, saying: \"Come in peace, my master and my disciple — my master, in wisdom; my disciple, for having done my bidding.\""

            "If the Beth Din and all Israel saw the new moon, 1 or if the examination of the witnesses had already taken place, but it had become dark before the word \"Mekudash [It is sanctified],\" was pronounced, the month will be intercalary. When the Beth Din alone saw it, two of its members must stand up before the others as witnesses, who shall then say, \"It is sanctified, it is sanctified.\" When only three forming a Beth Din have seen it, two of them must stand up as witnesses, and conjoin some of their learned associates with the single one, and then give their evidence before these, who are to say, \"It is sanctified, it is sanctified,\" because a single member of a Beth Din has not this faculty by himself alone.", 
            "All shofars are acceptable, except that of a cow because it is a horn (“keren”). Rabbi Yosi said: But all shofars are called “keren”, as it states, “upon a long blast from the ram’s horn ('keren')” (Josh. 6:5).", 
            "The shofar of Rosh Hashana – is [made] of an ibex [horn, and is] straight. Its mouth is coated in gold, and there are two trumpets alongside. The shofar [blast] extends while the trumpets cut short, since the mitzva of the day is with a shofar.", 
            "On fast days – [the shofars that are used are] of a ram, [and are] bent. Their mouths are coated in silver, and two trumpets are in the middle. The shofar cuts short and the trumpets extend, since the mitzva of the day is with trumpets.", 
            "The Jubilee year is equivalent to Rosh Hashana with regard to blowings and blessings.\tRabbi Yehuda says: On Rosh Hashana – we blow with those of rams, and on the Jubilee – with those of ibexes.", 
            "A shofar that was cracked and glued – [is] unfit. [If one] glued fragments of shofars – [it is] unfit. \t[If it was] pierced and he stopped it up:\tIf it impedes the blast – [it is] unfit, but if not – [it is] fit.", 
            "One who blows into a cistern, a barrel, or a jar: If he heard the sound of the shofar – he has fulfilled [his obligation]; if he heard the sound of an echo – he has not fulfilled [his obligation]. Similarly: one who was passing behind a synagogue, or whose house was adjacent to a synagogue, and heard the sound of the shofar or the sound of the scroll [of Esther, on Purim]: If he directed his heart – he has fulfilled [his obligation], but if not – he has not fulfilled [his obligation]. Even though this one and that one both heard, this one directed his heart, and that one did not direct his heart.", 
            "[In this manner we find it stated in Scripture, that] “And so it was, when Moshe raised his hand, Israel prevailed…” (Exodus 17:11) Do Moshe’s hands make or break war? Rather, this teaches: Whenever Israel would look upward and direct their hearts to their Father in heaven\t– they prevailed, and if not – they fell. You can say similarly: “Make a copper snake and place it on a pole, and everyone bitten who sees it will live” (Num. 21:8) Does the snake cause death or revive? Rather: Whenever Israel would look upward and subject their hearts to their Father in heaven – they healed; and if not – they were harmed. A deaf and dumb, or a foolish person, and a child, cannot relieve others from their obligation by acting for them. This is the rule—all those who are not bound to the performance of a religious duty, cannot release others from their obligation."

            "When the feast of new year happened on the Sabbath, they used to sound in the sanctuary, but not out of it. After the destruction of the temple, Rabban Jochanan, son of Zaccai, ordained that they should sound in every place in which there is a tribunal of justice [‏בית דין‎]. R. Eleazar says, \"He only issued this ordinance in respect to Jamnia,\" but they [the other sages] said unto him, \"It was the same for Jamnia as for any other place in which there is a permanent tribunal of justice.\"", 
            "And in this respect also, was Jerusalem privileged above Jamnia, viz. that every city from whence Jerusalem could be seen and the sounding heard, which was near enough, and to which it was allowed to go on the Sabbath, might sound; but in Jamnia it was only permitted to sound before the tribunal of justice.", 
            "Formerly the lulav [palm-branch, &amp;c] was taken seven days in the sanctuary, and only one day out of it. After the destruction of the temple, Rabban Jochanan, son of Zaccai ordained, \"that the lulav should everywhere be taken for seven days, in commemoration of the sanctuary,\" also, \"that the whole day of the waving [of the 'Omer'] it should be prohibited [to eat of the new corn].\"", 
            "Formerly evidence as to the appearance of the new moon was received the whole [of the thirtieth] day; but as it once happened that the witnesses delayed coming, which interrupted the Song of the Levites [at the evening sacrifice], it was ordained that witnesses should be admitted till the time of Minchah only, and if any came after that time, that and the following day were kept as holy. After the destruction of the temple, Rabbon Jochanan, son of Zakai ordained, \"that evidence as to the appearance of the moon should be received all day.\" R. Joshua, son of Korcha says, \"This too did Rabban Jochanan, son of Zakai ordain, viz. that wherever the chief of the tribunal might be, the witnesses need only go to the place of meeting [of the Sanhedrin].\"", 
            "The order of the blessings to be said on the feast of new year is as follows: the blessings ‏אבות וגבורות וקדשת השם‎, are said, with which are connected the ‏מלכיות‎ [or series of texts relative to the supreme rule of the Almighty] without sounding the shophar; then, concerning the holiness of the day, after which the shophar is sounded; then follow the ‏זכרונות‎ [or texts relative to the kind remembrance of the Almighty to his creatures], after which the shophar is again sounded. Next follow the ‏שופרות‎ [or texts in which the sounding of the shophar is mentioned], and the shophar is sounded [the third time], he then says, ‏עבודה‎, ‏הודאה‎ and ‏ברכת כהנים‎. Such is the opinion of R. Jochanan ben Nourrie: but R. Akivah objected, saying to him, \"If the shophar is not to be sounded after the reading of the ‏מלכיות‎, why are they to be mentioned?\" But the proper order is the following:—‏אבות וגבורות וקדשת השם‎ are said, with which the ‏מלכיות‎ are to be combined; after which, the shophar is to be sounded, then the ‏זכרונות‎ are to be read, and the shophar sounded; next ‏שופרות‎, and the shophar is again sounded; after which ‏עבודה‎, ‏הודאה‎ and ‏ברכת כהנים‎ are said.", 
            "Not less than ten texts of the Holy Scripture relative to ‏מלכיות‎ must be said, ten relating to ‏זכרונות‎, and ten to ‏שופרות‎. R. Jochanan ben Nourrie says, \"The obligation [of reading these texts] will be duly fulfilled if three only of each [class] have been said, but no texts relating to either [class] containing predictions of punishment are to be used. The texts from the law are to be read first, and the concluding texts are to be from the prophets.\" But R. Jose says, \"It is sufficient if the concluding verse be one from the law.\"", 
            "Those who pass in front of the ark on the Rosh Hashanah: The second one blows [the shofar], while at the time of the Hallel, the first one recites the Hallel.", 
            "It is not permitted for the purpose of sounding the shophar on the feast of new year, to go beyond the ‏תחום‎ [Sabbatical limits] to remove a heap of stones, mount a tree, ride on any animal, or swim over the waters [to get a shophar], nor may he cut it [thereon] with any thing that may not be used on account of transgression against the Sabbatical rest [‏שבות‎], nor on account of a direct negative commandment of the law; but a person may, if he choose, pour water or wine into the shophar. Children may not be prevented to sound, but, on the contrary, it is lawful to be occupied in teaching them to sound; but he who thus teaches, as also other persons who listen to these sounds, cannot thereby become released from their obligation.", 
            "The order of sounding the shophar is:—three sounds are blown thrice, the time of duration of the sound of six tekeah's, is equal to that of three terooah's, and that of each tekeah as three sighs or moans. If a person has sounded the first tekeah, and prolonged the sound of the second, so as to be equal to two, it will only reckon as one sound. If a person, after having said all the blessings, has at that moment only obtained a shophar, he shall sound three times tekeah, terooah, and tekeah; even as the minister of the congregation is bound [to say the amidah for himself], so is every individual bound to do so. But Rabbon Gamaliel says, \"The minister of the congregation releases the public from their obligation.\""
