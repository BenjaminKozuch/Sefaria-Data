            "Any part of a fruit that can serve as a handle but does not protect the fruit is both susceptible to impurity and can transfer impurity, but it is not included with the rest of the fruit to be considered for the minimal egg size.  If it does protect the fruit, even if it does not serve as a handle it is susceptible to impurity and can transfer impurity and it is counted as part of the minimal egg size.  If it neither protects nor serves as a handle it is not susceptible to impurity nor can it transfer impurity.", 
            "\"Roots of garlic, onion, and leeks: when they are moist, their stem: whether moist or dry, and the column which is next to the food; the roots of lettuce, radish and turnip [combine for the minimal egg size],\" the words of Rabbi Meir.  Rabbi Yehudah says, \"The big roots of radishes, combine [for the minimal egg size], but its fibers, does not combine [for the minimal egg size].\"  Roots of mint,  rue, field vegetables, garden vegetables which are uprooted to replant, and the stalks of grain, and their husks  - Rabbi Elazar says even the cobweb-like waste covering - all of these ar susceptible to impurity and can transfer impurity and combine [for the minimal egg size].", 
            "The following can become impure, and can make other things impure but do not combine. The roots of garlic, onion and leek when they are dry and their stems at the place where there is no food against them, and the handle of a grape vine a fistful on either side, the handle of a cluster of grapes, in any amount and the tail of a cluster of grapes that became exposed [through the removal of grapes] and four fistfuls of the handle of the date palm, and the three fistfuls of an ear of grain and three fistfuls of all handles of things that are cut, and whatever is not usually cut, even a minute amount of their handles or roots, and the bristles of an ear of grain these things can become impure, and can make other things impure but do not combine.", 
            "The following neither defile nor can they be defiled nor do they join together: The roots of cabbage-stalks, Young shoots of beet growing out of the root, and [the same with] turnips, [And produce whose roots] that are normally cut off but were pulled up [with their roots]. Rabbi Yose declares them all susceptible to impurity, but he declares insusceptible to impurity cabbage-stalks and turnips.", 
            "\"Handles\" of all foods that he threshed on the threshing-floor are clean. Rabbi Yose declares them unclean. A sprig of a vine the he stripped is clean. If he left one grape on it, it is unclean. A twig of a date that they stripped is clean. If he left one date on it, it is unclean. The same with beans: if they stripped the twigs it is clean. But if he left one bean pod, it is unclean. Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah declares [the stalk] of the broad bean clean, but declares unclean the stalk of other beans, since he desires its use.", 
            "Stems of figs and dried figs, klusim, and carobs both defile and can be defiled and join together. Rabbi Yose says: also the stem of a gourd. Stems of pears and krutumelin pears, quinces, and crab-apples, the stem of the gourd if it is a handbreadth and the stem of the artichoke if it is one handbreadth. Rabbi Elazar bar Zadok says: two handbreadths. [All] these defile and are defiled; but they do not join together. And all other stems neither defile nor are they defiled."

            "Regarding olives which one pickled together with their leaves, they [i.e. the leaves] are pure [and are not considered to serve as handles or to preserve the fruit], for they were pickled only for the sake of appearance. The fibers on a zucchini and its flower are pure. Rabbi Yehudah says: so long as it is before the merchant [selling it], it is impure. ", 
            "All pits can be rendered impure, and render impurity, and do not join together [with foods to count towards the measure for impurity]. The pit of a damp [i.e. fresh] date, even when detached, does join together [with the date to count towards the measure for impurity]; that of a dried [date] does not join together. Therefore, the surrounding membrane [of the pit] of a dried [date] does join together, but that of a fresh one does not join together. Regarding a pit which is partially detached, the part opposite the edible portion does join together. A bone which has meat on it, the part that is opposite to the edible part joins together [with the meat to count towards the measure for impurity, since it serves to preserve the meat]. If it had [meat] on one side, Rabbi Yishmael says: we view it as though it [i.e. the edible part] encircles it like a ring [and thus that entire part of the bone does join together]; and the Sages say: the part opposite the edible part joins together, as with savory, hyssop and thyme [where only those parts which are opposite the edible parts join together to count towards the measure for impurity]. ", 
            "Regarding a pomegranate or melon, part of which has rotted, it [i.e. the rotten part] does not join together [with the rest of the food, to count towards the measure of impurity]. If it is whole on either side, and rotten in the middle, it does not join together [and even the sides are not joined to each other]. The stem of a pomegranate does join together [to the rest of the fruit], and its flower does not join together. Rabbi Elazar says: even the crown [literally: the comb, around the stem] is pure [and does not join together].  ", 
            "All peels can be rendered impure, and render impurity, and join together [with the food to count towards the measure for impurity].  Rabbi Yehuda says: the onion has three peels; the inner one joins together, whether it is whole or pierced; the middle one joins together when it is whole, and it does not join together when it is pierced; and the outer one is pure [i.e. does not join together, and is considered to serve neither as a handle nor to preserve the food] in either case.", 
            "If one chops up [produce] for cooking, even if he did not complete the cut, this is not considered to be a connection [connecting the pieces together for matters of purity]. If [one chopped it up] for pickling, or for boiling, or for placing it on the table, this is considered to be a connection [for matters of purity]. If one began to separate [the pieces], the [part of the] food which he started [breaking off] is not considered to be a connection. If one strung nuts together, or tied a bunch of onions together, this is thereby considered a connection. If one began to take the nuts apart, or to peel the onions, this is not considered a connection. Regarding nuts and almonds [in relation to their shells], this is considered a connection, until one mashes them.", 
            "[The shell of] a cooked egg, [with regard to the egg, is considered to be a connection] until one cracks it. That of a hard-boiled egg [is considered to be a connection] until one mashes it. A bone containing marrow in it is considered to be a connection [between the bone and the marrow] until one mashes it. A pomegranate which was separated is considered to be a connection [between the seeds and the peel] until one knocks it with a stick [to loosen the seeds].  Similarly, the loose stitches of launderers [who would stitch pieces of laundry together to prevent them from getting lost] or a garment that had been stitched together with <i>kilayim</i> [the product of forbidden crossbreeding or working of certain animals with one another, planting together certain plants, or interweaving certain fibers] is regarded as a connection until one begins to undo them.   ", 
            "The green leaves of vegetables join together [to the vegetables to count towards the measure for impurity], and the white ones do not join together.  Rabbi Elazar bar Tzaddok says: the white ones of cabbage join together, since they are edible; and so also of lettuces, since they preserve the edible part.   ", 
            "Regarding onion leaves and the offshoots of onions, if there is moisture within them they are measured as they are [for matters of impurity]; if they contain hollow spaces within them, one should flatten their hollows [and then measure them]. Spongy bread is measured as it is; but if it contains any hollows, one must flatten its hollows [and then measure it]. The flesh of a calf which has expanded [during cooking], or the flesh of an old [beast] which has shrunken, are measured as they are.  ", 
            "Regarding a zucchini which one planted in a pot and it grew and emerged out of the pot [and onto the earth], it is pure [and cannot be rendered impure]. Rabbi Shimon says: [regarding the part of the plant still within the pot,] what is in its nature that it be considered pure? Rather, that which is [or can be rendered] impure [remains] in its impurity, and that which is pure [i.e. that which is outside of the pot] may be eaten. ", 
            "Vessels made of dung or of earth through which the roots can emerge outward do not prime the seeds [inside them to be susceptible to susceptible to being rendered impure]. A perforated pot does not prime the seeds [inside it to be susceptible to being rendered impure]. But that which is not perforated does prime the seeds. What is the measure for a perforation? That through which a small root can emerge. If one filled it to its brim with dust, it is thereby like as a tray without a rim [which cannot be rendered impure, as it is no longer a vessel]. "

            "There are those [foods] which require [before they can be rendered impure] to be primed [to be rendered impure, by being wet by a liquid] but which do not require intentional thought [designating them for human consumption]; and [there are those which require] intentional thought and to be primed; and [there are those which require] intentional thought but not to be prime; and [finally, there are those which require] neither to be primed, nor intentional thought [before they can be rendered impure]. All foods which are designated for human consumption require being primed, but do not require intentional thought.   ", 
            "[The following require both intentional thought, designating them for human consumption, and to be primed for impurity by becoming damp, before they can be rendered impure:] one that severs [flesh] from a human, from a [domesticated] beast, from a [wild] animal, from fowl, from the carrion of an impure [i.e. not kosher] bird, and [forbidden] fat in villages, and all remaining kinds of field vegetables, except for truffles and mushrooms. Rabbi Yehuda says: except for field-leeks, purslane and milk-blossom.  And Rabbi Shimon says: except for cynara sycaria [i.e. wild artichoke]. Rabbi Yose says: except for muscari comosum [i.e. grape hyacinth]. These [all] require both intentional thought and to be primed [for impurity].",

The carrion of a pure beast in all places, and the carrion of pure fowl and [forbidden] fat in the marketplaces, do not require intentional thought nor to be primed [for impurity]. Rabbi Shimon says: even [the carrion of] a camel, a rabbit, a hare, or a pig.   ", 
            "The aneth stalk: once it has given its taste to a dish, it is no longer subject to the laws of terumah, and it also no longer defiles food uncleanness.  The young sprouts of hawthorn, of lapidum, or leaves of wild arum, do not defile food uncleanness until he sweetens them.  Rabbi Shimon says: also [the leaves of] the colocynth are like them.  ", 
            "Costus, amomum, principal spices, crowfoot, asafoetida, pepper and lozenges made of saffron may be purchased with [second] tithe money, and they do not defile with food uncleanness, the words of Rabbi Akiva.  Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri to him: if they can be purchased with [second] tithe money, then why should they not defile with food uncleanness? And if they do not defile with food uncleanness, then they should also not be purchased with [second] tithe money? ", 
            "Unripe figs or grapes:  Rabbi Akiva says: they defile food uncleanness;  Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri says: once they have come to the season when they are liable to tithes.  Olives and grapes that have hardened:  Bet Shammai says: they are susceptible uncleanness,  Bet Hillel says: they are clean (insusceptible).  Black cumin:  Bet Shammai says: it is clean (insusceptible),  Bet Hillel says: it is susceptible to uncleanness.  Similarly with regard to [liability for] tithes.  ", 
            "The heart of a palm is treated like wood for all matters, except that it can be purchased for [second] tithe money.  Unripened dates are food, but are exempt from tithes.   ", 
            "Fish--from when do become susceptible to uncleanness?  Bet Shammai say: after they have been caught.  Bet Hillel say: after they are dead.  Rabbi Akiva says: if they can still live [they are not susceptible].  A branch of a fig tree was broken off, but it was still attached by its bark: Rabbi Judah says: it [the figs] are clean. But the sages say: [it all depends] whether [the figs] could still live.  Grain that had been uprooted, but is still attached to the soil even by the smallest of roots, is clean.   ", 
            "The forbidden fat of a clean beast is not regarded as unclean with carrion uncleanness; therefore, it requires something to make it susceptible.  The forbidden fat of an unclean beast, is regarded as unclean with carrion uncleanness; therefore it does not require something to make it susceptible.  Unclean fish and unclean locusts, require intention to make them susceptible in villages. ", 
            "A bee-hive:  Rabbi Eliezer says: it is treated as if it were land; and one can write a prozbul (a document allowing debts to remain valid through the sabbatical year) through it, it is also not susceptible to uncleanness as when it is its place, and the one who removes honey from it on Shabbat is liable to a sin-offering.  But the sages say: it is not to be treated as if it were land, and one many not write a prozbul on its; it is susceptible even if it remains in its own place; and the one who removes honey from it on Shabbat is exempt [from a sin-offering].

The numerical value of the letters is three hundred and ten) and their store houses I will fill.\" Rabbi Shimon ben Chalifta said: Hashem has not found any utensil that can hold the blessing which Israel [deserves] except for peace, as it says, (Psalms 29:11) \"Hashem gives strength to his nation, Hashem will bless his nation with peace.\""
