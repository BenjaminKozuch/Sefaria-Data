            "One who has seen one discharge of <i>zov</i> [abnormal seminal discharge], Beit Shammai say, he is like a [woman] who observes a day against a day [whatever he lies or sits on becomes unclean]. Beit Hillel say he is like a <i> ba'al keri</i> [one who had an emission of semen whether by nocturnal emission or by sexual activity; whatever he lies or sits on does not become unclean].  If he saw [a discharge] one day and on the second day it stopped and then on the third day saw two [discharges] or one [discharge] as profuse as two, Beit Shammai say he is a full fledged <i>zav</i> [a male who has seen the discharge which renders him unclean]. Beit Hillel say, he renders unclean those item he sits or lies upon  and he requires immersion in running water [mikvah] but he does not have to bring a sacrifice.  Rabbi Elazar the son of Yehuda said, Beit Shammai agree in this case that he is not a full fledged <i>zav</i>, rather they disagree in a case where [on the first day] he sees two [discharges] or one [discharge] as profuse [the volume] as two , and on the second day it stopped and then on the third day [he once again] had one discharge, [in this case] Beit Shammai say he is a full fledged <i>zav</i> and Beit Hillel say,  he renders unclean those item he sits or lies upon  and he requires immersion in running water [mikvah] but he does not have to bring a sacrifice.", 
            "One who sees a <i>keri</i> [seminal discharge] on the third day of counting after after his <i> zavut</i> {abnormal seminal discharge], Beit Shammai say, it voids the two [clean] days that preceeded it [and he must start counting again], Beit Hillel say it only voids that day [and he can continue his count  the next day]. Rabbi Yishmael says, If he saw it on the second day it voids the preceeding day. Rabbi Akiva says, it makes no difference if he saw it on the second day or third day, [in either case] Beit Shammai say it voids the two preceeding days, and Beit Hillel say it only voids that day. They agree, however, that if he saw it on the fourth day [of his counting]  it only voids that day [provided that what] he saw was a seminal emission.  If, however, if he saw an abnormal seminal discharge emission, even on the seventh day, it voids [all] previous days.", 
            "If he saw one discharge [of <i>zivah</i> today and two tomorrow, or two today and one tomorrow, or three on three days or three nights he is a full fledged <i>zav</i>. ", 
            "If he saw one [discharge of <i>zivah</i>] and it stopped long enough for him to immerse himself [in a mikvah] and dry himself, and then he saw two [discarges] or one [discharge] as profuse as two, or if he saw two [discharges] or one [discharge] as profuse as two, and it stopped long enough for him to immerse himself [in a mikvah] and dry himself, and then he saw one [discharge] he is a full fledged <i>zav</i>.", 
            "If he saw one [discharge] as profuse as three [discharges] lasting as long as it takes to walk] from <i>Gad Yavan</i> to <i>Shiloach</i>, [an interval] which would be sufficient for two immersions [in the mikvah] and two dryings, he is a full fledged <i>zav</i>. If he saw one [discharge] as profuse as two,  he renders unclean anything he sits in on or lies upon and he requires immersion in running water [mikvah] but he does not have to bring a sacrifice. Rabbi Yose said, They did not speak of one [discharge] which was profuse [enough to make him a full fledged <i>zav</i>], unless there was enough [volume] to equal three.", 
            "If he saw  one [dischrage] during the day and one at twilight, [or] one at twilight and one the next day, if it is known that part of the sighting [the discharge at twilight occurred] during the day and part was the next day,  he is certain with regard to a sacrifice [that he must bring one as a <i>zav</i>] and with regard to unclenliness[he is uclean]. If is was doubtful if part of the sighting was today and part was the next day, there is no doubt regarding his uncleanliness, but there is doubt regarding his sacrifice. If he saw [discharges] on two [consecutive] days at twilight, there is  doublt  regarding his uncleanliness and his sacrifice. If he saw one [discharge] at twilight, there is a doubt  regarding his uncleanliness."

            "All [persons] are made unclean through a <i>zivah</i> discharge, even converts, even slaves, whether they are emancipated or not emancipated, a deaf mute, a mentally deficient person, a child, a eunuch [whether rendered impotent] by man or a eunuch from the time of seeing the sun [from birth]. [With regard to] a <i>tumtum</i> [person of uncertain gender], or an  <i>androgynous</i> [hermaphrodite], we impose upon them the stringencies of the man and the stringencies of a woman; they render unclean through [menstruation] blood like a woman and through egglike substance [semen] like a man, but their uncleanliness remains in doubt.", 
            "There are seven ways a <i>zav</i> is examined [for the cause of his discharge], providing he has not entered the bounds of <i>zivah</i> [it is not established that he is a <i>zav</i>. He is examined if the discarge is not the result of an external cause and thus regular semen]; with regard to food [that he has eaten], drink, [that he has drunk], a load [he may have  carried], a jump [he may have made], sickness [he may have sufferd] , [an improper] sight [he may have seen] or [impure] thoughts [he may have had], whether  he had impure thoughts before seeing [a woman] or he saw [ woman] before he had the impure thoughts [the emission caused by all of the above is considerd a normal emission and he does not become a <i>zav</i>]. Rabbi Yehuda says [adds], Even if he saw cattle, wild animals or birds copulating with each other, [and] even if he saw the colored garments of a woman [the emission does not render him a <i>zav</i>]. Rabbi Akiva says, even if he ate any kind of food, whether bad or good or he drank any kind of drink  [the emission does not render him a <i>zav</i>]. They [the sages] said to him, [according to you] there will never be <i>zavim</i>. He [Rabbi Akiva] responded to them, The responsibility of [the existence of] <i>zavim</i> is not upon you. [However] once he has entered the bounds of <i>zivah</i> [once it is esatblished that he is a <i>zav</i>], we no longer examine him. [Discharges resulting from] an accident or a doubtful [discharge] and seminal emissions are [considered] unclean because the matter has feet [there are grounds for the assumption that it is <i>zavut</i> emission]. [When] he sees the first discharge he is examined [for the seven things]. [When he sees] the second discharge he is examined [for the seven things].  [When he sees] the third discharge, we no longer exmine him. Rabbi Eliezer says, Even at the third [incident] we examine him because [of the need to know if he is obligated to bring] a sacrifice.", 
            "If one sees a seminal emission [followed by a second emission], he does not convey uncleanliness by way of <i>zivah</i> for a twenty four hour period [starting from the time of the sighting]. Rabbi Yose says, [only] that day. A non-Jew who saw a seminal emission and converted, he is immediately unclean by way of <i>zivah</i>. If one [a woman] saw [menstrual] blood or had difficulty [in labor], [the time prescribed for retroactively making things that she touched unclean] is a twenty four hour period. One who strikes his slave, the 'day or two' [that the Torah (Exodus 21:21) speaks of] is a twenty four hour period. If a dog ate the flesh of a [human] corpse, [the flesh remains] in its natural state for three days [twenty four hour periods].", 
            " A <i>zav</i> makes things which he lies upon unclean in five ways rendering people unclean and clothing unclean. [They are] by standing, sitting, lying, balancing [a hanging object] and by leaning. [The item he] lies upon makes a person unclean seven ways rendering clothing unclean. [They are] by standing, sitting, lying,  balancing [a hanging object], leaning, touching and carrying."

            "[If] a <i>zav</i> and a clean person sat together on a boat or on a raft or they are riding on an animal, even though their clothing do not touch, they are unclean due to  [uncleanliness called] <i>medras</i> [treading contact]. [If] they sat on a plank, a bench, a bed frame or a beam that are  insecure, [or] if they [both] climbed up a tree that is weak, or [they were] on a weak branch in a strong tree, [or they were climbing] an Egyptian ladder that was not securely [to a wall] with a nail, [or they sat together] on a bridge, a rafter or on a door that was not made [secured] with clay, they are unclean. Rabbi Yehuda says they are clean. ", 
            "[If a <i>zav</i> and a clean person] close or open [a door together, the clean person and his clothes are unclean], [but] the Sages say, [he does not become unclean unless]  one is closing [the door] and one is opening [the door]. If one was raising the other from a pit [the clean person and his clothes are unclean]. Rabbi Yehuda says, only if the clean one is the one raising the unclean one. [If  they were] twisting ropes together [the clean person and his clothes are unclean], [but] the Sages say, only when  one is pulling in one direction and the other is pulling in the opposite direction. [If they were] weaving [together], whether standing or sitting, or they are grinding [wheat, the clean person and his clothes are unclean]. Rabbi Shimon [says that in all the cases] the clean man remains clean, unless they were grinding with a hand mill. [If they were] unloading a donkey or loading it, if the load is heavy, they are unclean, if the load is light, they are clean. In both cases [whether the load is light or heavy] they are clean to join members of the synagogue [who eat <i>chullin</i> in purity] but are [considered] unclean [if he is a <i>kohen</i>] to eat <i>terumah</i> [a portion of a crop given to a <i>kohen</i> which becomes holy upon separation, and can only be consumed by the <i>kohen</i> or his household].", 
            "[If] a Zav and a clean person sat [together] on a big boat, [but] what is a big boat? Rabbi Yehuda says, One that does not sway with a man's weight, [or if] they sat on a plank, bench or bed frame or a beam when they  are firmly secure, [or] they went up into a tree that is strong, or in a branch that is strong [or they they were climbing] on a Tyrian ladder or an Egyptian [ladder] that was secured [to a wall] with a nail, [or] on a ramp or a rafter or on a door when clay was used [to secure them in the ground], even [only] on one side, they are clean. A clean person that hit an unclean person [he remains] clean. [If] an unclean person hits a clean person, [the clean person] becomes unclean,  because if the clean person draws [back, as he is being hit], the unclean person would surely fall,  thus it is as if the <i>zav</i> had actually leaned on the clean person and that renders him unclean]."

            "Rabbi Yehoshua says, [If] a <i>niddah</i> [a menstruant woman] sat with a clean woman on a bed, [even] the cap on her [the clean woman's] head are unclean due to  [uncleanliness called] <i>medras</i> [treading contact]. [If] she [the menstruant woman] sat in a boat, [even] the vessls that are on top of the mast are unclean due to <i>medras</i>. [If] she took a tub of clothes, if their weight was heavy, they are unclean, [If] their weight was light, they are clean. [If] a <i>zav </i> knocks against a balcony, and [as a result] a loaf of <i>terumah</i>  falls, it remains clean.", 
            "[If a <i>zav </i>] knocked [against] a joist, a rafter frame, a [water] pipe,  a shelf, although it is secured [only] with ropes [not with nails],  an oven, a flour receiver [to collect the flour after it is ground], a lower mill-stone,  the [wooden] base of a of a hand mill, the <i> se'ah</i> [a specific unit of volume] measure of an olive grinder [fixed to the ground], Rabbi Yose says, also [if he knocks] into the bath attendant's bourd, it [remains] clean.", 
            "[If a <i>zav </i>] knocked against a door, a door-bolt, a lock, an oar, a mill-stone frame, a weak tree, a weak branch of a strong tree, on an Egyptian ladder that was not secured [to a wall] with a nail, [or they sat together] on a bridge, a rafter, on a door that was not made [secured] with clay, they are unclean. [If a <i>zav </i> knocked] on a chest, a box, a cupboard they are unclean. Rabbi Nechemia and Rabbi Shimon render them [the latter three case] clean. ", 
            "[If] a <i>zav </i> was lying on five benches or five money-bags, [if he was lying on them] lengthwise they are unclean, [if he was lying on them] breadthwise they are clean. [If] he slept [on them across their width and] there is doubt whether he turned over on them [along their length], they are unclean. If he was lying on six seats, [with] his two hands on two [seats], his two  feet on two [seats], his head on one [seat], [and] his body on one [seat], only the one [seat] that was under his body is unclean. If he sood on two seats, Rabbi Shimon says, if they were distant from each other, they are clean.", 
            "Ten cloaks [piled] one on top of the other, [if a <i>zav </i>] slept on the top one, they are all unclean. [If] a <i>zav </i> was on one pan of a balance and [objects fit to] lie or sit on, were on the opposite side [pan], if the <i>zav </i> weighed down  [his pan, thus pushing the objects up], they are clean. If it objects weighed down [pushing the <i>zav </i> up] they are unclean. Rabbi Shimon says, [if there was] a single [object to sit or lie on] it is unclean, [but] if there were many, they are clean, since none of them have supported the greater part [of the weight of the <i>zav </i>].", 
            "[If] a  <i>zav </i> was on one pan a balance and food or liquid in the second pan, they are unclean. [In the case of] a corpse, everything [in the other pan] are clean except for a man [if a man is in the other pan and his pan went down and the corpse was raised]. This [is a case of] greater stringency applied to a <i>zav </i> than to a corpse, [but there is another case of] greater stringency applied to a corpse than to a <i>zav </i>.  For a <i>zav </i> renders unclean by lying or sitting anything that is under him , to convey uncleanliness to people and garments,  and [imparts into] whatever is above him <i>midaf</i> uncleanliness [uncleanliness arising from the unclean person's indirect contact], so that they render food and liquids unclean, [whereas] a corpse does not render them unclean. Greater stringency is found by a corpse, for the corpse  conveys uncleanliness  by overshadowing and imparts uncleanliness for seven days, which is not the case by a <i>zav </i>.", 
            "[If a Zav] was sitting on a bed and four garments were under the four legs of the bed, [then they] become impure because [the bed] cannot stand on three [legs]. Rabbi Shimon calls them pure. [If a Zav] was riding on an animal there were four garments under the four legs of the animal, they are [still] pure because [the animal] can stand on [only] three [legs]. [If] there was one garment under its two front legs or under two of its back legs, or under a front and back leg, it becomes impure. Rabbi Yose says: A horse transmits impurity with [only] its back legs but a donkey [does this] with [only] its front legs because a horse leans on its back legs, but a donkey leans on its front legs. [If a Zav] sat on the beam of an olive press (used to further crush the olives), utensils in the olive basket (where the beam has been placed) become impure but [if he sat] on the launderer's clothes press, utensils beneath them(i.e. in between the two boards that press the clothes) are [still] pure. Rabbi Nechemia call them impure."

            "One who touches a Zav, or a Zav touches him, one moves (without touching) a Zav , or if a Zav moves him, [attains a level of impurity that] can make impure food or drink or utensils that can be immersed [in a Mikva and thereby made pure] through contact, but not through lifting [them indirectly]. [The following is] a rule that Rabbi Yehosua said:  Anyone who is [of a level of impurity to] make his clothing impure, when he is touching [the impure source], he can make food and drink the first [level of impurity] , and hands the second [level], but cannot make impure people or clay vessels. After he has separated from the impure source, he makes drinks the first [level of impurity] and food and hands to be the second [level of impurity] and cannot make clothing impure.", 
            "And another rule that they [the sages] said: Anything being supported on top of a Zav becomes impure but anything that is supporting the Zav is [still] pure except for [furniture] that is designed for laying or sitting upon, or [another exception is] a person. How [does this law apply]? [If] the finger of a Zav was under a row of brick, the pure person [sitting] on top of [the bricks] or a pure person under them, he makes them both <i>Metamei Shnaim U'Posel Echad</i> (lit. makes two impure and one disqualified, a term referring to a level of impurity that can make something impure which can then make something else impure which can then disqualify Teruma, i.e. an Av HaTuma/source of impurity). If [either of them] separated themselves [from the bricks] he is <i>Metamei Echad U'Posel Echad</i> (lit. makes one impure and one disqualified, i.e. first level of impurity that can make something impure which can then disqualify Teruma). [If] food or drink or [furniture used for] lying or sitting, or Madaf (term used for other utensils placed on top of a Zav) placed on top [of a Zav] <i>Metamei Shnaim U'Posel Echad</i>. [If] they were separated, they <i>Metamei Echad U'Posel Echad</i>. But [furniture used for] lying or sitting below [a Zav] <i>Metamei Shnaim U'Posel Echad</i>. Food, drink and Madaf below become impure.", 
            "[The reason for the previous law] is because anything supporting or being supported by [furniture used for] lying is [still] pure except for a person. Anyone supporting or being supported by a corpse of an animal is [still] pure unless he moves it. Rabbi Eliezer says: Only (lit. even) if he supports it [while moving it]. Anyone supporting or being supported by a corpse is [still] pure unless it makes a roof [over the corpse], or [unless] it is a person when he is moving it. ", 
            "[If] part of an impure person is on a pure person or part of a pure person is on an impure person, [or] the connections of an impure person (referring to their teeth, nails and hair) are on a pure person, or the connections of a pure person are on an impure person, they become impure. Rabbi Shimon says: [If] part of an impure person is on a pure person, he becomes impure but if part of a pure person is on an impure person, he is [still] pure.", 
            "[If] an impure person was on part of [furniture used for] lying on, or a pure person was on part of [impure furniture used for] lying on, [the pure object] becomes impure. [If] part of an impure person was on [furniture used for] lying on, it is [still] pure. It ends up being that [impurity both] enters [the furniture] and emits from it, with part of it [being lain on]. So too, a loaf of Teruma (gift given to the Kohen) that is put on [impure furniture used for] lying on and there is paper between them, whether [the loaf] is on top or it is on the bottom [of the furniture], it is [still] pure. So too, [if instead of paper] there was an Even Minga'as (stone which was part of a house which contracted Tzara'as) it is [still] pure. Rabbi Shimon calls this [last case] impure.", 
            "One who touches a Zav or a Zava (when a woman sees blood beyond her period) or a Niddah (a menstruating woman) or a woman who has recently given birth, or a Metzora (person who contracted Tzara'as), [whether through furniture used for] lying or sitting, they are <i>Metamei Shnaim U'Posel Echad</i> (see Mishna 2). [When] they separate [from the source of impurity] they are Metamei Echad U'Posel Echad. [The law] is the same whether one touched, moved, supported or was being supported [by any of the above sources of impurity].", 
            "One who touches the Zav emission of a Zav or his spit, semen, urine, or the blood of a Niddah, is <i>Metamei Shnaim U'Posel Echad</i> (see Mishna 2). [If] he separated, he is <i>Metamei Echad U'Posel Echad</i>. [The law] is the same whether one touched or moved any of the above sources of impurity]. Rabbi Eliezer says: Even (alternatively, only) if he supported [them]. ",

One who supports an animal corpse or water that purifies (this water also impurifies the one who carries it) [because ashes of a red cow are mixed in] of an amount that can be sprinkled, is Metamei Shnaim U'Posel Echad.

            "One who eats from the carcass of a kosher bird and it is [still] in his throat, is Metamei Shnaim U'Posel Echad (see Mishna 2). [If] he stuck his head into an oven (lit. air of an oven) [with it still in his throat], it is [still] pure and the oven is [still] pure (this line is seemingly superfluous because both phrases refer to the oven). [If] he spit out or swallowed it, he is Metamei Echad U'Posel Echad but when it is [still] in his mouth before he swallows it, he is pure.", 
            "One who touches a Sheretz (one of eight animals whose carcasses are sources of impurity), or semen or something made impure by a corpse or a Metzora during his [initial] count [of seven days] or water that purifies (this water also impurifies the one who carries it) [because ashes of a red cow are mixed in] that is not enough to sprinkle, or an animal carcass or an [impure] saddle is Metamei Echad U'Posel Echad. This is the rule: Anyone who touches one of any of the sources of impurity [which are listed] in the Torah, is Metamei Echad U'Posel Echad unless [the source was] a person. [When] he separated [from it, whether it was a person or not] he is Metamei Echad U'Posel Echad. ",

And one who has sexual intercourse with a Niddah is like one who was made impure by a corpse except that one who has sexual intercourse with a Niddah is more stringent, because he makes [things] impure by lying and sitting [a level of impurity which is] lenient impurity (i.e. first level of impurity) [which can impurify] food and drinks. ", 
            "[The following] disqualify Teruma [by making it impure]: One who eats food of the first [level of impurity] or one who eats food of the second [level of impurity] or one who drinks impure liquids or one who dunked his head and most [of his body] into water drawn [from its natural source] (this is when he does this immediately after immersing in a Mikva), or a pure person that three Logs (Mishnaic volume) of drawn water fell on his head, or a scroll [of Torah], or hands or a Tevul Yom (one who has immersed in a Mikva but needs to wait until sunset to be fully pure), or food or vessels that can be made impure through liquid."
