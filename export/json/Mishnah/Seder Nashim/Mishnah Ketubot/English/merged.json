Should there be [property to the value of] three hundred dinar, she [whose Ketubah is] of one hundred dinar receives fifty, she of two hundred receives one hundred, and she of three hundred dinar receives one hundred and fifty [dinar]. In like manner, three who join their funds [form a co-partnership], whether they have diminished or increased their capital, the above is [the proportion to be observed] in which they divide.", 
            "[Of] him who married four wives and dies, the first wife has priority before the second, the second before the third, and the third before the fourth. The first is put upon her oath by the second, the second by the third, the third by the fourth, but the fourth recovers her Ketubah without being sworn. Ben Nanas saith,[paragraph continues] \"What! because she is the last is she to be favored? She likewise cannot recover without being sworn.\" Should [the Ketuboth] have all been executed on the same day, whichever [of them] precedes the others even by one hour, enjoys [the priority]. Therefore in Jerusalem they inserted the hour. Should all [the Ketuboth] have been executed in the same hour, and there is no more [property left] than [to the value of] a maneh, they divide [it between them, share and share] alike.", 
            "[Of] him who has married two wives, and sells his land, should the first wife undertake in writing to the purchaser, \"Right and claim have I none against thee,\" the second [wife] may [nevertheless] recover the land from the purchaser. But then the first [wife] recovers it from the second, and the purchaser again recovers it from the first [wife], and thus the title [and possession of the field] keeps shifting [from one to the other] until they come to an arrangement. Such is also the case with a creditor, and if the wife proceeds as a creditor."

Simeon saith, \"[A widow] after actual marriage, may sell without applying to the Bethdin; but [a widow] after betrothment [only], must not sell, without [previous application to] the Bethdin, because she [the last named] is not entitled to her maintenance [out of the husband's estate]; and any woman who is not entitled to a maintenance, must not sell, without [previous application to] the Bethdin.\"",

Should her Ketubah be one hundred dinar, and she has sold to the amount of one hundred and one dinar, the sale is void; even though she offers to make good the one dinar to the orphans, her sale is void. R. Simeon ben Gamaliel saith, \"Her sale is always valid, unless she thereby prevents the orphans from having a field of nine kab seed corn, or a garden of half a kab seed corn.\" According to R. Akivah, \"[A garden of] one-quarter kab seed corn.\" Should her Ketubah amount to four hundred dinar, and she sells to one a hundred dinar worth, and to another a hundred dinar worth, and to the last purchaser she sells to the value of one hundred and one dinar for one hundred, her last sale is void, but all her preceding sales are valid.",

The first husband is not entitled to say, \"When she comes to me I will maintain her,\" but he must bring her maintenance to the place where she is with her mother. Neither are the two husbands at liberty to say, \"We will jointly maintain her,\" but the one must maintain her, and the other give her the value of her maintenance in money.",

Should she declare, \"I will not remove from my father's house,\" the heirs may reply, \"While thou art with us thou shalt have thy maintenance, but if thou art not with us, thou shalt not have thy maintenance.\" Should she object to this, because she herself is young, and the heirs likewise are young, they are bound to furnish her maintenance, and she continues in her father's house.",

            "Two rigorous magistrates were in Jerusalem, Admon and Hanan ben Abishalom. Hanan pronounced two decisions, and Admon seven. [In the case of] a man that went beyond seas, and whose wife claimed her maintenance [out of his real estate], Hanan decided she must be put upon her oath at the close [of the proceedings], but not at the commencement [thereof]. The sons of high priests disputed with him, and maintained that she must be put upon her oath at the commencement as well as at the close [of the proceedings]. R. Dosa ben Harkeenos adopted their opinion, but R. Jochanan ben Zachai declared, \"Hanan had decided justly, and that she is not to be sworn till the close [of the proceedings].\"",

Dosa ben Harkeenos adopted their opinion; but R. Jochanan ben Zachai declared, \"Hanan decided justly: for the man has placed his money on the antlers of a stag.\"",

[In opposition to this rule] Admon remarked, \"What, because I am a male, am I to be the sufferer?\"  Rabbon Gamaliel said, \"I approve of Admon's remark.\"",

            "[In the case of] two men, who [sueing each other for debt] produce cross bonds against each other, Admon remarked \"[The holder of the last dated bond has a right to plead] 'Had I been in thy debt, why didst thou borrow of me?'\" But the sages decided, \"That each is entitled to recover [the amount of] the bond he holds.\"",

She can be compelled tomove [with him] from an inferior dwelling to a superior one; but she is not compelled to move [with him] from a superior dwelling to an inferior one. R.
