            "The <i>Kohanim</i> [priests] stood watch in three places in the Temple:  in the Chamber ofmAvtinas [name of a family] , in the Chamber of <i> Nitzot</i> [spark] , and in the Chamber of Fire.  The Avtinas and <i> Nitzot</i> chambers were elevated  and the youngsters [<i>Kohnaim</i>] would [stand] watch there.  The Chamber of Fire  was domed structure, surrounded by benches of stone.  The elders of the <i>beit av</i> [family] would sleep there and the keys to the courtyard were in their hands.  The young  <i>Kohanim</i> would sleep in their clothes on the ground.  They did not sleep in their holy clothes but would take them off, fold them, put them under their heads and sleep wearing their own clothing.  If one had a seminal emmision, he would exit and walk down a circular [staicase] that led under the Temple where  candles were burning on both sides [to give light] until he got to the immersion area.  There was a bonfire and a restroom there.  This was the respectfulness:  If he found it locked, he would know that there was somebody there.  If it was open, he would know that there was nobody there.  He'd go down and immerse himself, come up and dry off and warm himself by the bonfire.  He would go [to the Chamber of Fire] and sit with the other  <i>Kohanim</i> until the gates opened and leave and go on his way.", 
            "Anybody [of the <i>Kohanim</i>] who wishes to remove [the ashes] from the altar must rise early and immerse himself [in the mikva] as long as the supervising <i>Kohen</i>  hasn't yet arrived. When did the supervising <i>Kohen</i> arrive? There is no set time; sometimes he comes when the rooster crows, or close to it, sometimes before, sometimes after. The supervisor  would knock on them [the doors to the Temple] and they [the <i>Kohanim</i>] would open [the doors] for him. He would say to them, \"Whoever has immersed, come and participate in the lottery.\" They would perform the lottery and whoever won, won.", 
            "He [the supervising Kohen] took the key and opened the small door [located in the Chamber of Fire] and entered from the Chamber of Fire to the Courtyard. And they [the other Kohanim] entered after him with two torches of fire were in their hands. They would split into two groups. [One group] walked under the portico [surrounding the Courtyard] towards the east and [the other group] walked under the portico towards the west. They would check [the temple vessels] and walk until they reached the place where the <i>Chavitim</i> [loaves of bread brought as meal offering]. They [the two groups] met each other and would say, \"It is fine, all is fine,\" [the vessels are in order]. They would appoint [from their group] makers of the <i>Chavitim</i> to make the <i>Chavitim</i>. ", 
            "The one who won the right to remove the ashes from the altar, would remove [the ashes] and they [the other <i>Kohanim</i>] say to him, \"Be careful to not touch the utensil [the shovel] until you have sanctified your hands and feet from the <i>kiyor</i> [the laver].\" And [they would continue saying],\"Look, the shovel is placed in the corner between the ramp [of the altar] and the altar, on the west of the ramp.\" No one would enter [the area between the altar and the antechamber] with him, and he didn't have a candle in his hand, rather he would walk by the light of the altar's pyre. They [the other Kohanim] would not see him and would not hear him until they heard the sound of the wood that Ben Kitin made [into] a wheel for the laver [being turned], and they would say, \"The time has come to sanctify your hands and feet from the laver.\" He would take the silver shovel and go up to the top of the altar and stir the coals from side to side, and then scoop from the inner consumed [coals]. He then went back down. When he reached the floor, he would turn his face to the north [and] walk along the eastern side of the ramp for about ten <i>amot</i> [cubits]. He piled the coals on the floor three <i>tefachim</i> [hand-breadths] from the ramp, the [same] place where they would put the crop of the bird [ of a burnt offering ] and the ashes from the [golden] inner altar and the ashes of  the <i>menora</i>."

            "His brothers [the other Kohanim] saw him go down [from the altar] and they would run; they hurried and sanctified their hands and feet from the laver [and] took the shovels [used to scoop ash] and the forks [used for moving sacrificial parts] and  go up to the top of the altar. The limbs and the fats that weren't consumed [by the fire] the previous evening, would be moved to the sides of the altar. If the sides of the altar could not hold them, they would arrange them around the altar [on the ledge surrounding it].", 
            "They [the <i>Kohanim</i>] began heaping the ash onto the <i>Tapuach</i> [lit. apple; a pile] The <i>Tapuach</i>  was in the middle of the top of the altar.  Sometimes there was approximately three hundred <i>kor</i> [measurement of volume] on it. During pilgrimage festivals, they would not remove its ash, because it was a decoration for the altar [to show that it was being used frequently]. During the days [of the Temple], the Kohanim were never lazy about removing the ash [when there was too much].", 
            " They [the <i>Kohanim</i>] began transferring the [wood] logs to arrange the pyre [on the altar]. But are all [types of] wood valid the pyre? Yes, all [types of] wood are valid for the pyre, except wood from an olive [tree] and from a vine. It was [the wood] of these [trees] they was commonly used, branches of a fig tree, walnut [tree] or an oil [tree].", 
            "He [the <i>kohen</i>] arranged the large pyre towards the east [side of the altar], and it \"looked\" [small openings] towards the east [side] and the ends of the inner logs would touch the <i>Tapuach</i>. There was  space between the logs from where they would ignite the twigs.", 
            "They would select [from the stockpile] nice [logs] of fig wood to arrange the secondary pyre  [used for] incense. [It was]  opposite the south western corner [of the altar], pulled in from the corner four <i>amot</i> [cubits] towards the north. [They placed enough wood] that by their estimation[ would produce] five <i>Se'ah</i> [Mishnaic volume] of coals and on Shabbat [ they would place on this pyre enough wood] that they esimated [would produce] eight <i>Se'ah</i> of coals, for that was where  they would placed the two spoonfull of frankincense of the <i>Lechem HaPanim</i> [show breads placed on the table in the Temple]. The limbs and the fats that were not consumed [by the primary fire] the previous evening [and had been temporarily placed on the sides of the altar] they [the <i>Kohanim</i>] would return them to the pyre. They ignited the pyres with fire and went down [from the altar] and went to the <i>Lishkat HaGazit</i> [chamber on the eastern side of the couryard]."

            "The appointed [<i>Kohen</i>] said to them [in the <i>Lishkat HaGazit</i>]: Come and draw lots [to determine] who will slaughter [the daily <i>Tamid</i> offering], who will throw the blood [of the offering on the altar], who will remove the ash from the inner altar,  who will remove the ash from the <i>Menora</i> who will take the limbs [of the <i>Tamid</i> offering] up the ramp [of the altar]. [Specifically who will transport] the head, the right hind leg, the two forelegs, the tail, the left hind leg, the chest, the neck, the two sides, the intestines, the fine flour [for the meal offering, offered daily along with the tamid], the <i>Chavitim</i> [the <i>Kohen Gadol's</i> daily meal offering of flour and oil baked in a pan] loaves and the wine [for libation]. They would draw lots, and whoever won, won.", 
            "The appointed [<i>Kohen</i>] said to them: Go out and see if the time of slaughtering [the <i>Tamid</i>] has arrived. If it [the time] has arrived, the watchman would say, \"It [the eastern sky] is shining [it is dawn].\" Masya ben Shmuel says: [the <i>Kohen</i> would then ask] \"Has the eastern sky is lit up until Chevron?\" and he [the watchman] would say \"Yes!\"", 
            "He [The appointed <i>Kohen</i>] said to them: Go out and bring a lamb from the Chamber of Lambs. Now, the Chamber of Lambs was in the north-western corner [of the Chamber of Fire]. There were four chambers there: one was the chamber of lambs, one was the Chamber of Seals, [where one could buy tokens marked with the appropriate meal offering], one was the Chamber of Fire, and one was the chamber where they would make the <i>Lechem HaPanim</i>.", 
            "They [the <i>Kohanim</i>] then went to the Chamber of Vessels  and took out from there ninety three silver vessels and golden utensils. They would give the [lamb to be] the <i>Tamid</i> [offering] to drink from a golden cup. Even though it had been checked [for blemishes] the previous evening, they would check it [now] by the light of a torch.", 
            "The one who won [the right to slaughter] the <i>tamid</i> [offering], would drag it and go to the House of Slaughtering [the area where the offerings were slaughtered] and the ones who won [the right to place] the limbs would walk with him. The House of Slaughtering was to the north of the altar and near it there were eight short pillars and squares of cedar wood  were [each] of them and iron hooks were inserted into them [the squares]; there were three sets [of hooks] for each one [block], upon which they would hang [the slaughtered animal]. The [animal] would be skinned on  marble tables that were between the pillars.", 
            "The one who won [the right to remove] the ash from the inner altar and [the one who won that right] for the Menora would go ahead and had four vessels were in their hands: [they were] the basket [to hold the ash from the inner altar] and the jug [to hold the ash from the Menora] and two keys. The basket was similar [approximately] to a <i>tarkav</i> [measurement of volume] of gold that could hold two and a half <i>kav</i> [measurement of volume]. The jug was similar to a large pitcher of gold. And the two keys, one [was to unlock the door from the inside] he put [his hand through a small opening]  up to the armpit, and one [was for a lock] that could be opened quickly.", 
            "He came to the northern small opening. There were two small openings in the Great Gate, one in the north [side of the gate] and one in the south [side]. The one in the south, no one ever entered through it, and about it Yechezkel explained and said,  \"And Hashem said to me 'this gate will [remain] closed, it shall not be opened, and a man my go through it because Hashem, the G-d of Israel go through it; it is [to remaon] closed.\" (Ezekiel 44:2) He took the key and opened the small opening. He entered the cell and from the cell to the sanctuary until he reached the Great Gate. [When] he reached the Great Gate he removed the bolt and the locks and opened it. The one who was slaughtering [the <i>tamid</i> offering] would not slaughter until he heard the sound of the Great Gate was opened.", 
            "From Jericho they would hear the sound of the Great Gate being opened. From Jericho they would hear the sound of the <i>Magraifa</i> [lit. shovel, a musical instrument with holes in it ] From Jericho they would hear the sound of the wood that ben Katin made for the wheel of the laver. From Jericho they would hear the sound of Gevini the Announcer [that the Kohanim should begin their service]. From Jericho they would hear the sound of the flute. From Jericho they would hear the sound of the cymbal. From Jericho they would hear the sound of the [daily] song [of the Levites]. From Jericho they would hear the sound of the shofar [sounded daily]. There are those that say [they even heard] the sound of the <i>Kohen Gadol</i> [the High Priest] at the time when he would mention the name [of G-d] on Yom Kippur. From Jericho they would smell the aroma of the compounding of the incense. Rabbi Eliezer ben Daglai said: [My] father had goats on the mountains of Michvar and they would sneeze from the smell of the compounding of the incense.", 
            "The one who won [the right] to remove the ash from the inner altar, went in and took the basket [used to collect the ash] and placed it in front of him, and he would scoop [the ashes] and put them inside it [the basket], and in the end, he swept the rest into it [the basket] and he would leave it [in the sanctuary] there and leave. The one who won [the right] to remove the ashes from the Menora , would enter [the sanctuary], [if] he found the two eastern lamps [still] lit, he would remove the ash from the other [lamps] ned leave the ones burning in their place. If he found them extinguished, he would remove the ashes from them and re-kindle them from the ones that were still lit  and then remove the ashes from the rest. There was a stone in front of the Menora which had three steps that on them the <i>Kohen</i> would stand and prepare the lamps. He would leave the jug on the second step and leave."

            "They would not bind the lamb [as they were slaughtering it], except for binding one front leg to one back leg. The ones who won [the right] to [bring] the limbs would grab it [as it was being slaughtered]. And this is how they would bind it: its head would face south and its face to the west. The one slaughtering would stand to the east [of the lamb] with his face to the west. [The Tamid offering] of the morning was slaughtered on the north western corner [of the altar], on the second ring [in the house of rings]. [The Tamid offering] of the evening was slaughtered on the north eastern corner on the second ring. The slaughterer would slaughter and the one who [was designated] to receive [the blood] would receive it and go to the north eastern corner [of the altar] and tossed it to the east and north. [Then he went to] the south western [corner] and tossed it to the west and south. The rest of the blood was poured on the southern base [of the altar].", 
            "...[The own skinning the Tamid offering] would not break its leg [as was the normal practice], rather he would make a hole in it through its knee and hang it [by it]. He would skin it and go downward until he reached the chest. [When] he reached the chest, he would cut the head and give it the one who won [the right] to it. He would cut the feet and give them to the one who won [the right] to them. He would finish the skinning. [Then] he would rip [out] the heart and remove its blood. He would cut [off] the front legs and give them to the one who won [the right] to them. He went up to the right hind leg. He would cut it and give it to the one who won [the right] to it as well as the two testicles. He would tear apart [the rest of the lamb] and it would be exposed before him. He would take the fat and put it on the place of slaughter of the head, on top (i.e. the neck). He would take the innards and give them to the one who won [the right] to them to wash them. And the rumen, they would wash in the house of washing, as much as necessary. And the innards, they would wash them at least three time on the tables of marble that were between the pillars [in the house of rings].", 
            "...He would take the knife and separate the lung from the liver and lobe from the liver but he would not move it from its place. He would puncture the chest [to remove it] and give it to the one who won [the right] to it. He would go up to the right flank and he would cut downward until the spine but he would not touch the spine until he reached the two soft ribs [near the neck]. He would cut [the right flank] and give it to the one who won [the right] to it and the liver would [remain] hanging from it. He would come to the neck and leave on it the two ribs on either side.  He would cut it [the neck] and give it to the one who won [the right] to it. And the trachea and the heart and the lungs would [remain] hanging from it. He came to the left flank and left on it two soft ribs [that were] above it and two soft ribs below it. And so too did he do to its pair [the right flank, see above]. In the end, he would leave on both of them two [ribs] each on the top and two [ribs] each on the top. He would cut it [the left flank] and give it to the one who won [the right] to it and the spine with it and the spleen was hanging from it. And [the left flank] was bigger [than the right because it had the spine] yet the right was called 'big' because the liver was hanging from it. He came to the behind. He would cut it and give it to the one who won [the right] to it and the tail and the lobe of the liver and the two kidneys were with it. He would take the left rear leg and give it to the one who won [the right] to it. In the end, all of them [the Kohanim] were standing in a line and the limbs were in their hands. The first with the head and the [right] rear leg. The head was in his right hand and its snout was towards his arm and its horns were between his fingers and the place of slaughter was facing up and the fat was put on it. And the right rear leg was in his left hand and the place where the skin [used to be] was facing outwards. And the second, with the two front legs. The right in his right hand and the left in his left hand and the place where the skin [used to be] was facing outwards. The third, with the behind and the rear [left] leg. The behind in his right hand and the tail dangling between his fingers. The fourth, with the chest and the neck. The chest in his right hand and the neck in his left hand with its ribs between his fingers. The fifth, with the two flanks. The right in his right hand and the left in his left hand with the place where the skin [used to be] facing outwards. The sixth, with the innards placed in a golden utensil and the feet were on top. The seventh with the fine flour [Mincha (meal) offering]. The eighth with the Chavitin [loaves of bread baked daily]. The ninth with wine [for the daily wine libation]. They [all] went and put them from the middle of the ramp [to the altar] and downwards, on the west side, and they would salt them [there]. And they went down from there to the Lishkat HaGazit to read Shema."

And when the appointed Kohen heard the steps of the Kohen Gadol as he was leaving [the sanctuary], he lifted the curtain [to the antechamber of the sanctuary], entered and bow and left and [only then] did the rest of his brothers, the Kohanim, enter and bow and leave.", 
            "They [the Kohanim] would come and stand on the steps of the antechamber [of the sanctuary after offering the daily incense]. The first [five Kohanim who already performed their part of the Tamid service] stood to the south of their brother Kohanim and had five utensils in their hands, the basket [used to collect ash from the golden altar] in one hand, the jug [used to collect soot from the Menora] in one hand, the shovel [used to bring the coals for the incense] in one hand, the pan [of incense] in one hand, and the [secondary] incense pan in one hand. And they [all the Kohanim] blessed the nation with one blessing, which outside the temple they [break into] three blessings, but in the temple is one blessing. In the temple they would say [G-d's] name as it is written but outside the temple they would use a pseudonym. Outside the temple the Kohanim lifted their hands [only] up to their shoulders, but in the temple they would lift them above their heads except for the Kohen Gadol who would not lift his hands above the Tzitz (golden headplate) as it says, (Leviticus 9:22) \"And Aaron raised his hands towards the people and blessed them.\"", 
            "Whenever the Kohen Gadol wanted to offer the incense [instead of the Kohen who won the lottery], he would go up the ramp with the vice Kohen on his right side. When he reached half-way up the ramp, the vice Kohen would grab his right hand [if he was tired] and helped him up. The first [Kohen] passed him the head and rear [right] leg [of the Tamid] and he [the Kohen Gadol] would lean his hands on them and then throw them [on the fire]. The second one passed the first one the two front legs who would then give them to the Kohen Gadol, who would then lean on them and throw them. When second one would then go away. And so they would pass him the rest of the limbs and he would lean on them and throw them. And whenever [the Kohen Gadol] wanted, he would [only] lean on them and others would throw them. He then went around the altar. Where would he start [his circle]? From the the south eastern corner [then to] the the north east, [then to] the north west [then to] the south west. They gave him the wine to pour [as a wine libation]. The vice Kohen would stand on the horn [of the south west corner of the altar] with the flags in his hand (this will be explained) and two Kohanim would stand on the table of fats [to the west of the altar's ramp] with two silver trumpets in their hands. They would blow a tekiya then a terua then a tekiya [specific sounds made with a trumpet]. They came and stood next to ben Arza [the one who played the cymbal], one on his right and one on his left. [When the Kohen Gadol] bent and poured [the wine libation], the vice Kohen waved the flags and ben Arza swung the cymbals and the Leviim would sing. When they reached [the end of] a chapter [of Psalms], they would blow a tekia blast and the nation [that was looking on] would bow. For every chapter, they would blow a tekia blast. And for every tekia, they would bow. This [what was described in the previous chapters of Mesechtat Tamid] is the order of the Tamid sacrifice for the service of the House of G-d, may it be His will that it be built speedily in our days. Amen.", 
            "[These are] the songs that the Leviim used to say in the temple: On Sunday they would say, (Psalms 24) \"To Hashem is the land that which fills it, the inhabited world and its inhabitants.\" On Monday they would say, (Psalms 48) \"Great is Hashem and very praised, in the city of G-d on his holy mountain.\" On Tuesday they would say, (Psalms 82), \"God standeth in the congregation of God; In the midst of the judges He judgeth.\" On Wednesday they would say, (Psalms 94), \"Hashem is a vengeful G-d, he appears as a vengeful G-d.\" On Thursday they would say (Psalms 81), \"Sing for joy to G-d our strength. Shout out loud to the G-d of Yaakov.\" On Friday they would say, (Psalms 93), \"Hashem has reigned, he wears splendor etc.\" On Shabbas they would say (Psalms 92), \"A Psalm, a Song. For the sabbath day.\" [The latter song] is a psalm for the future, for the day that is completely tranquil (in Heb. Shabbas) for all eternity."
