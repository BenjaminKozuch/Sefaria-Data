                    "<b>Moshe received the Torah from Sinai:</b> Explains the rabbi from Bartenura, [Moshe received it] from the One who was revealed at Sinai. And there, when He was revealed at Sinai, [Moshe] received it with its general principles, its particulars and its inferences and there was no law that was to be innovated [later]. And it is as it is found in Torat Cohanim which is cited by Rashi on Leviticus 25:1at the beginning of Parshat Behar. And to teach this, [the mishna] states \"from Sinai.\" And 'it is not an empty thing,' since, behold, it is a sign of the religion: it is one for its nation, the congregation of Israel that received it. It is complete to its Creator - the students, they are the children of God; what an experienced student is to innovate in the future, all of it was received by Moshe. As it is stated (Deuteronomy 9:10), \"and upon them, as all of the words,\" and they expounded in the second chapter of Megillah 19b, \"[this] teaches that the Holy One, blessed be He, showed to Moshe the inferences of the Torah and the inferences of the scribes (<i>dikdukei sofrim</i>).\" And even though the inferences of the scribes were only by way of seeing - as I explained in the Introduction - it states, 'received,' since it is speaking about the majority [of what was revealed to him]. [This is] as was explained by Ramban in the Introduction to the commentary on the Torah about the fifty gates of understanding that were created in the world - that it states, 'created' about the majority. So does it appear to me. ", 
                    "<b>and he passed it on to Yehoshua:</b> As everything that he received, he passed on to Yehoshua. But concerning Moshe, it cannot state that it was passed on to him, since [it was] not the whole Torah [which] was passed on to him. As, behold, the fiftieth gate [of wisdom] was not passed on to him, as they, of blessed memory, stated (Rosh Hashana 21b) on (Psalms 8:5), \"and you have made him slightly less than the angels/God.\" And therefore it stated with him, that he received - meaning to say, that everything that was fitting for him to receive, he received at Sinai. Such have the commentators explained.  ", 
                    "<b>and the prophets passed it on to the men of the Great Assembly:</b> [Meaning] to say that even though not all of the Assembly were prophets, the entire Torah was passed on to them, as it was passed on to those who preceded them. But from here on - as the generations declined - not the entire thing was passed on. But [rather] everyone received it according to his ability. And nonetheless, the [portion of] the Torah that was in his hand was a transmission to him, [that had been passed on] one man from another [going back] to Moshe, our teacher - peace be upon him - from Sinai.", 
                    "<b>The Great Assembly:</b> The rabbi from Bartenura wrote that they were called this since they restored the crown to its original splendor, etc... Yirmiyahu and Daniel came but did not say, “mighty and awesome:\" Yirmiyahu said (Jeremiah 32:18), the Power, the great and mighty Lord of hosts is His name.\" Daniel said (Daniel 9:4),”the great and awesome\" and did not say, \"the mighty.\"", 
                    "<b>\"They said three things:\"</b> The rabbi from Bartenura explained [that these are three things] that contain within them the preservation of the Torah. And in Mishna 10 of Chapter 2, he explains also that [these things] were accustomed to be in their mouths, like he explained, \"He would say,\" below in Mishna 2.", 
                    "<b>\"and stand up many students:\"</b> They [used] an expression of standing, since from the days of Moshe until the days of Rabban Gamliel, they would study while standing [as the rabbi from Bartenura explained at the end of Sotah] and the teacher would sit on a chair (Megillah 21a) - Midrash Shmuel in the name of Rabbi Yosef ibn Nachmias. And even though this is correct according to the language, nonetheless this is not the intended message - whether they should stand or sit. And why does it state, \"and stand up?\" It should have stated, \"and teach,\" since this is the intended message. Hence it appears to me that it states, \"and stand up many students,\" [meaning to say] to stand them up on their feet, that they should not slip. This is to say, to stand them up on their feet in understanding the truth of the Torah. As this is [something's] standing and establishment, as falsehood has 'no feet,' as in the way of the Psalmist (Psalms 73:2), \"my feet were almost pushed away.\" And since it wanted to say, \"many,\" therefore it was necessary to mention the standing - since, even though they were many, even with all that, the study should be in the manner that they will stand and be established upon the truth. As without this, it is not [considered] the standing up of students. But [rather] they would be gazing [and] laying down in a trance of foolishness. It comes out for us from these general words that we do not observe this ethic unless we teach the truth and that which is just, nothing else. And see what I will write, with the help of Heaven, in Mishna 6."

                    "<b>”The world stands:</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, \"The world was only created, etc.\" And about the mishna at the end of our chapter, it is written in Midrash Shmuel, “There are books found,  that have the textual variant, 'the world was created.'”", 
                    "<b>\"On the Torah:\"</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, \"Had Israel not received Torah, the heavens and the earth would not have been created, as it is written (Jer. 33:25), “Were it not for my covenant, etc.\" And since it was difficult for him, as 'service and acts of kindness are [also a part  of] Torah, therefore he explained [Torah here] as its receiving; and the explanation of the verse would be, “If not for my covenant” that you accepted, “night and day, also the laws of the heavens and the earth I would not have set.” And see similar to this at the end of Chapter 3 of Nedarim. And this is difficult to me, since if so, “on the Torah” which it stated is not a warning at all; and [so] it is not similar to the others. And hence it appears to me that the Torah [here] is [referring to] reason and Torah study. And this is [the understanding] of that which is written, “if not for my covenant (which is studied) night and day.” [This is] as the matter is stated (Yehoshua 1), “and you shall reason in it night and day.\" And in the commentary of Rashi, “for were it not, etc...” is not extant, but rather [just], “on the Torah, as it is stated, 'if not, etc...'” ", 
                    "<b>\"and on the [Temple] service:\"</b>And they were not precise, as it is not the language of a mishna nor a bereita, but [rather] the statement of <i>amoraim</i> (scholars form the later part of the Talmudic period.): Rabbi Yakov bar  Acha said that Rav Assi, etc. in Taanit 27b in Chapter 4. And one should be precise [about] the language of the statement, “If it were not for the groupings [involved in the sacrifices], the heavens and earth would not stand.” And if so, it is not a proof that it was because of them that they were created. As behold, it is possible to say that [only] after they were created, they would no longer exist if there were no groupings. But it is not that the groupings were a reason for their creation, that they were created for their sake <i>ab initio</i>, as the power of that which preserves a thing that already exists is not as great as the power of that which creates a thing that was not [in existence]. And if so, from where in this statement do we get that the power of [the sacrificial] service is great enough that for its sake was  the world put into existence and created. And I found about this statement, that it is also extant in the Chapter [entitled] Bnei Ha'eer in the tractate Megillah 31a. And there, it is stated like this, “Rabbi Ami said, 'If it were not for the groupings, the heavens and earth would not stand, as it is stated,  “If not for my covenant night and day, also the laws of the heavens and the earth I would not have set” and it is written (Genesis 15:8), “And he said, 'Lord, God, in what way will I know that I will inherit it'” - said Avraham, our father, peace be upon him, “Master of the universe, maybe – God forbid - Israel will sin in front of you, etc.” He said to him, “Take a threefold calf, etc.”'” And he expounds [that], “My covenant” is referring to the covenant between the pieces [just cited] and he stated, “I would not have set.” We infer from this that the [sacrificial] service is a reason for the setting of the world and its creation. And if you will ask, let it be [the case] during the time that the Temple is in existence, but from since it was destroyed, what is there to say; one can answer that the world was created for the sake of His looking forward to the time that the Temple will exist. And also, that behold, it concluded the statement mentioned, “He said in front of Him, 'let it be [the case] when, etc.'” and He answers him, “I have already established the [written] order of the sacrifices: whenever they read about them, I count it for them as if they sacrificed a sacrifice in front of me.” And what is written in the commentary of Rashi on Taanit is confused – since from where did he [derive] to learn it [about this statement]?"

                    "<b>The man of Sokho:</b> He was the master of the place that was called Sokho. And \"man\" is an expression of master, as we learn in a mishna, \"my man, [the] High Priest\" in tractate Yoma 18. And there, Rabbi Bartenura explained in Mishna 3 of the first chapter, \"'My man' is my master.\" [And see Chapter 4 of Challah, Mishna 10, s.v. the man of Tekoa, etc.]", 
                    "<b>\"Do not be as servants who are serving the master in order to receive a reward:\"</b> Rabbi Bartenura expalined, \"but rather out of love alone.\" Meaning to say, that about this he [only] warned that the service be from love only, since it is the essence of service and not that he meant to say that service on the condition of receiving a reward is forbidden, since [such a one] would be serving God nonetheless. And therefore the perfect Torah did not stop from making known the reward and punishment [that depends upon performance of the commandments]. But if one serves with the hope of reward or the prevention of hurt, behold, he is not on the same level as the one who serves from love, as [the latter] does not have any personal interest in his service at all. And the teacher [of this mishna] wanted to warn us to be from those that serve from love, but not to exclude the one who serves with the hope of a reward from the category of those that serve [God], as this is not the case. [This is] as their statement in the first chapter of Bava Kamma 10b, \"One who says, 'this coin is given to charity in order that my son should live; in order that I should have a share in the world to come' - behold, he is completely righteous.\" And also, if you do not say like this, you will - God forbid - cut off the feet of the 'haters of Israel' (a euphemism for the Jews), as where is the one who can weigh and where is the one who can count and say that he is someone who serves from love. Would it be good in the eyes of God that anyone who serves and has in mind that the Torah's stipulation that was told to us from His mouth, may He be blessed, should materialize for him should not receive his goodly reward for this? It is not good for their Master that you should say like this. And so [too] did Rebbi say at the beginning of Chapter 2, \"And weigh the loss [that may be sustained through the fulfillment] of a commandment against the reward [that may be obtained] for [fulfilling] it.\" And [it is] as I have written there, with Heaven's help. And so [too] in the end of the second chapter, \"And the Master of your work is trustworthy, etc.\" And see over there what I will write about [the statement,] \"and know the reception of their reward.\" And [the statement] of Azariah, brother of Shimon in Zevachim 1:2 proves [it]. And even [the teacher of our mishna] did not intend this. And I say from his own words can you learn this and that he, himself, was careful about this, that we should not stumble from his words. As he said, \"Do not be as servants, etc.\" and did not say, \"Do not serve in order to receive a reward.\" And in this way he taught his students [this] in a quick fashion. Rather, he taught by saying, \"Do not be like servants, etc;\" meaning to say that certainly those that serve in order to receive a reward are [also] servants, but you should not be like them but greater than them and serve from love alone. And I saw from our master, our teacher, the rabbi, Rabbi Loewe from Prague, of blessed memory, in the book, Derekh Chaim that he wrote that therefore did [the teacher of our mishna] state, \"but rather be like servants, etc.\" and it was not enough for him to state, \"Do not be, etc. Since from his statement, \"Do not be,\" it would have sounded like he was negating and forbidding [one] from being \"like servants that serve, etc.;\" and this is not [correct], as this is not a prohibition, since even one who serves in this way is completely righteous. Rather, he is only coming to teach that there is a level and status still greater than this, and that is the one who serves from love. And hence he was compelled to repeat and say, \"but rather be like, etc.;\" [meaning] to say that the point of his intention is that you should be \"like servants that serve their master not in order, etc,\" and that this is the greatest level. But he is not intending to say that it is forbidden to serve in order to receive a reward. These are his words and his opinion, of blessed memory. And from here, go and learn that behold this teacher, according to his completeness and his wisdom, was very wise in his words. Since  in the beginning of his words, he taught about this that one should not negate those that serve in order to receive a reward, but [rather] that also those that serve to be repaid to receive reward, he calls servants. And he also added an explanation, to explain: \"but rather be, etc.,\" to say, \"Are these not my words that I speak, that you should be [serving without the need for reward]. But not that I intended with my statement, 'do not be, etc.' to forbid. My main intention was just that 'you should be, etc.' to edify you to the most complete level of completion, and not to forbid the other as mentioned. And from here, all the more so should it not be understood according to the words of the teacher the mistake of Tsadok and Beitos, who said that he intended to say that there is no receiving of reward at all here, as is mentioned in the words of Rabbi Bartenura in his commentary on Mishna 11. But he should have explained it explicitly, that it be explicit for all that hear [it]. (And I saw in Tosefot in the first chapter of Rosh Hashana 4 at the top, who wrote that our Mishna relates to gentiles who regret the earlier [good deeds]. To here [is what I saw]. And I wonder, how is it possible to say this, that the teacher chose his case about idol worshippers. And all the more so, since all of these words in Avot they were [constantly] accustomed to say, according to one opinion of Rabbi Bartenura above in Mishna 2. And also our holy rabbi (Rabbi Yehuda Hanassi) should not have placed it in the Mishna if his words were only about idol worshippers. And my mind was set at ease when I saw the words of [Tosefot] in the beginning of the first chapter of Pesachim 8b at the top, who wrote that [the mishna] is speaking about a situation that if [a Jew] does not get the good that he was expecting, he wonders and regrets the [act of] charity that he did, but one who does not wonder and regret, behold, he is completely righteous. And so [too] is it implied in the beginning of Rosh Hashana and in the first chapter of Bava Batra. And according to this, that which they mentioned idol  worshippers in Rosh Hashana was only an example, as they wonder [about good deeds when they are not rewarded for them], as it is found over there in the gemara. But our mishna is with a Jew that wonders. And their words [that were puzzling] are meant to say that our mishna is like a case of idol worshippers, etc., [but] is [the case] of a Jew that wonders - who is like an idol worshiper who generally wonders.)", 
                    "<b>Reward (<i>peras</i>):</b> Rabbi Bartenura wrote, \"It is what a person gives to someone who served him, but who is not legally obligated to give him anything,\" meaning to say that this is the distinction between a reward and payment. Since payment is what must legally be given. And so [too] is what Rambam wrote. ", 
                    "<b>\"not in order to receive a reward:\"</b> And a different version of the text is, \"in order not to receive a reward.\" And I did not understand this version, as it is not relevant to say that he should serve in order and on condition that He should not give him a reward. As it is implied from this that if He would give him a reward, he would not serve Him. And even though the author of Midrash Shmuel wrote - that according to the first version, \"Even though he serves without distinction, and not in order, etc., nonetheless, he knows that in the end the reward will come, and behold he hopes for the reward. But [rather] serve in order not to receive a reward: which is that he explicitly serves in order that he not receive a reward, but [rather] from complete love.\" Up to here [are his words] - he fixed the matter but not the language [of the alternate text]. And that which he responded to the text [extant] in the book - that behold, even though that he only serves out of love, he [still] knows that the reward will eventually come - I say that this is not the way of one who serves from love.  Since if this is so, there is no greater servant from [want] of reward than this. But one who [truly] serves from love is always coming short in [his] service in his [own] eyes.  And he thinks to himself that he has not served as is fitting to Him, due to his great love for Him, may He be blessed. And so did Hillel say, \"And if I am for myself, what am I,\" as per the commentary of Rabbi Bartenura on Mishnah 14. And not only that, but not only does he not hope with the hope of reward, but he fears for his soul lest he has sinned in his shortcomings in his service and has been guilty. And that is how the teacher [of this Mishnah] ends and says, \"and may the fear of Heaven be upon you,\" and as I will explain. And such was the attribute of the forefathers, since thus did Avraham, our father, peace be upon him - even though he was assured of [having] seed - say afterwards, \"and I am going barren.\" And this is [also what is referred to as] the dread of Yitschak. And Yaakov was also afraid, lest he was dirtied by sin. This is the inheritance of the servants of God, who serve from love. 'And that which goes up in their heart will not be' a hope for reward at all. And therefore the [alternative] version of the book is the correct one. So does it appear to me. ", 
                    "<b>\"and may the fear of Heaven be upon you:\"</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained that \"the one who serves out of fear is careful concerning negative commandments\" and so [too] was explained by Rambam. And according to what I wrote above, [this statement] is itself a condition of the one who serves from love. And that which they called God, may He be blessed, with the name, \"Heaven,\" is to say that this fear should not be be a fear of punishment, which is also a superficial service and it carries some personal interest. But [rather] the fear that they warned about is a fear (awe) of His greatness, may He be blessed. And this was taught by the name, \"Heaven,\" since there His  greatness and power are apparent though the creatures of the heavens and all of their multitudes and their movements, without a doubt. So does it appear to me. "

And therefore I say that before them the pairs are not mentioned, as there was one leader in [each] generation and none second to him. Which is not the case from those days onwards, when the connection was separated and 'they became like two heads.\" And, nonetheless, all of their Torah was true, as behold they received it [transmitted by their predecessors].

And also because the main intention of letting know the transmission which the teacher made known was to teach the chain of transmission which is from Sinai, one man from another until this redactor.

And there also, it did not mean that it was was forbidden for them to sit and that they would only learn while standing up. As it was only saying that there was vigor in the world and [so] they would learn standing up in honor of the Torah, but if sometimes something would occur that [would make] them sit - for example, they would be long in the study hall  - here it is saying that \"they were accustomed, etc.\" And also (another possibility is that) it is like Rava (in Megillah 21) who answers the [seemingly contradictory] verses, \"and he sat at the mountain\" [and] \"and I stood at the mountain\" - the soft [easy] ones standing up, the difficult ones sitting down.

And these are the words of Rambam: \"Judges' advisers are individuals that teach claims and laws until people become expert in their cases, such that they compose questions, that when the judge says like this, your answer should be thus - as if  they were setting up the case and the litigants in front of them. And for this are they called 'judges' advisers' - it is as if they set up the cases in front of them.\" Up to here [are his words.] And according to this the word, 'advisers,' implies [the] two words, '[of] the cases before,' and is not relating to the word, 'judges' alone. And in the book, Lev Avot, [its author] writes that he heard that thus is its explanation: that he is like a judges' adviser himself, since the judgment that the judges decide to render this one innocent is on account of that which he ordered [the litigant's] claims - and, if so, this one advised the judges to make this judgment. Up to here [are his words.] And in Midrash Shmuel, [the author] writes in the name of the teacher, Rabbi Matatyah Hayitzhari and these are his words: \"It should not enter your mind, that he will make as a claim for the litigant words of iniquity and trickery, as such ones are complete evildoers, but [rather] even [when he uses] words of truth and the case changes on account of what he does. [It is] like that [case] in the chapter [entitled] Naara Shenitpateta (Ketuvot 52b) in the case of [the payment for] healing [a man's widow] that has no limits [and so] is like sustenance (<i>mezonot</i>) and is payed from the estate of the husband, [wherein] Rabbi Yochanan advised them, \"Set a fixed amount [with a physician] for the healing so that it will be something that has a limit [and no longer considered like sustenance].\" Up to here [are his words]. And from this came out for me an explanation of the words of Rabbi Bartenura who wrote, \"and to say to him, 'Do the following.'\" And [ostensibly] he should have said, \"You should claim the following,\" like the words of Rambam. But rather my opinion is that [he is only speaking about] bringing up advice for [the litigant] to do an act like that [case] of Rabbi Yochanan and so also with Rabbi Nachman in the chapter [entitled] Hakotev (Ketuvot 86a) [wherein] he brought up advice to [bring about] the relinquishment of a marriage contract. But it is possible that according to Rabbi Bartenura one need not be pious and refrain from teaching him to order his words and his claims, so long as there is no falsehood in it. But certainly for Rambam it is not the case, but rather even the ordering of words more generally is also forbidden. And these are the words of the teacher, Rabbi Yonah which are brought in Midrash Shmuel: \"It is not speaking here about one who teaches false claims to his friend, since a man like that is completely wicked and this is a big sin - and [in this tractate] we are dealing with words of piety. Rather [it is speaking] about one who orders the claims that are in his mouth and finds reasons for them, and he sets it up in front of the judges and reveals the judgement to him. And he says that it is not fitting to do so, as they will suspect him.\" Up to here [are his words]. And from the words of them all we have learned that this is why the teacher said, \"like judges' advisers\" with a [Hebrew letter] kaf [which as a prefix means, 'like']. Since if he had said, \"Do not make yourself a judges' adviser, it would have been implied that the setting up [of legal cases] is forbidden by law and this is not [true]. And it also appears to me by being precise that [the reason] the teacher said, \"yourself\" and did not teach it with brevity - \"do not be, etc.\" - is because of [the case] of Rabbi Yochanan.  As we say in the gemara, that this is why he gave advice - since he was a relative and reasoned [that it was a case of] 'from your flesh, do not turn away.' And afterward, he had regret and said, \"We have made ourselves like the judges' advisers,\" since he reasoned that it is different with an important person. And we infer from here that if he was not an important person, what he did would have been fine because of 'from your flesh, do not turn away.' And that is [the reason for] what the teacher said, \"Do not make yourself;\" which is to say according to yourself, since you are an important person - do not make you like the advisers but besides that it is certainly permissible. And according to that, even not for his relative is it permissible when he is not an important person. And that which Rabbi Yochanan said, \"'From your flesh, do not turn away,'\" is [because] if it were not for that, why should he do this to make one lose against the other, as 'what did he see that made the blood of this one redder.' And so [too], the warning of the teacher [of this mishnah] is only for an important person, since he was precise to teach, \"yourself. But when he is not an important person, there is not even piety [in abstaining from helping a litigant] as he is not teaching him to claim falsehoods."

                    "<b>Rabban Gamliel said:</b> And he was the grandson of Hillel, as we said in the first chapter of Shabbat 15, “Hillel and Shimon Gamliel and Shimon were the leaders during the time of the [Temple] for a hundred years.” And the commentators explained that for this reason was there no expression of receiving written from here on – since disagreement increased in Israel from the time of the students of Shammai and Hillel. And the Torah became like two Torahs, hence it is not relevant to say, 'receiving' with them, as the Torah of each and every sage was not defined and received and transmitted as it was with the earlier ones. But to me it appears that if it was for this [reason], the teacher would not have refrained from teaching that they received. As behold, they did receive the main parts of the Torah and there is no disagreement in it in any way, as Rambam explained in detail in his introduction to the Commentary on the Mishnah. But there is no difficulty to begin with, as in Chapter 2, Mishnah 8, we learn, “Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai received from Hillel and Shammai.", 
                    "<b>and do not frequently tithe by estimation:</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained “the one who separates, etc... if he adds, etc... his tithes are disrupted” since untithed produce is mixed in with them. Rambam, Laws of Tithes, Chapter 1. And so [too] did Rashi write in the second chapter of Kiddushin 52. And in the fourth chapter of Eruvin 9, he concludes, “which is not the case with priestly tithes (<i>terumot</i>), which has no measure. And see the commentary of Rabbi Bartenura on Mishnah Terumot 4:6. And in Midrash Shmuel, it is written in the name of the pious Rabbi Y. N. Shoshan and these are his words: \"It is a wonder in my eyes why he did not completely forbid to tithe except by measuring. And let it say, 'Do not tithe by estimation.' What is [meant by] 'do not frequently (literally, increase)?' And therefore I say that the intention is that  even if you intend to increase the tithes and to give more than the measure [it it forbidden], lest you err in your estimate. And Tosefot in Gittin 31 (in the third chapter) agrees that they did not forbid it except when one has the intention to increase and increases [tithes] on purpose. [They learn this] from that which we learn in Mishnah Terumot 4:6, “More praiseworthy then all three of them” - it is implied that there are three [legal] possibilities [even though only two are explicitly mentioned, such that the third possibility implied in the mishnah] is estimation. And so [too] did Rabbi Bartenura explain there. We learn from this that even according to the Sages, estimation is not forbidden - and that is when he doesn't intend to increase [the tithe beyond its measure]. And nonetheless, according to Rambam that I [cited] there it is forbidden [even] without intention. And so [too] are the words of Rash there. And our teacher in Derekh Chaim explains that our mishnah is like Abba Eliezer ben Gomel - who Rabbi Bartenura mentions in the Mishnah Demai 5:2 – who holds that even the priestly tithe from the tithe  (<i>terumat maaser</i>) - that has a measurement - is taken by estimation, and certainly with tithes also does he hold like this. And so [too] is it found in the gemara in Bekhorot 59, and it is as is written in the commentary of Rabbi Bartenura on Mishnah 7 in the last chapter of Bekhorot. And that is why he says “do not frequently,” [meaning] even though the Torah permits you to tithe by estimation, nonetheless, do not do it frequently in order to avoid a doubt. To here are his words. And it is not difficult [such that one could ask], \"What is different about [the main tithe as opposed to other types of tithes] that the mishna [specifically mentions] tithes.\" Since 'tithes' is a general name for all of the gifts that are from the [produce] of the land, as I have written is the language of the Yerushalmi Ma'asrot 4:2. And see the beginning of Mishnah Demai 4. But I saw in the commentary of Rash on Mishnah Terumot 1:7, who wrote that it appears that Abba Eliezer ben Gomel does not reason like that [which is written], \"Do not frequently, etc.\" And so [too] wrote the Tosefot in Gittin and Bekhorot mentioned above.
