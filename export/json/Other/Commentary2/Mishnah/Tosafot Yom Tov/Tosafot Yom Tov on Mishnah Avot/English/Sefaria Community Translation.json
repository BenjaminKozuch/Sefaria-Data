                    "<b>\"Distance [yourself] from a bad neighbor:\"</b> It stated an expression of distancing with his neighbor, since a person is close to him. And with an evildoer who is not his neighbor, it was not forced to say, 'distance,' since he is not close. [Rather,] it only warned him not to befriend him. And it said about the neighbor, \"bad,\" and about the one who is not a neighbor, \"evildoer\" - even though both of them are evildoers - since his being neighbors with an evildoer is bad for [the latter's] neighbor, and his proximity is very harmful. But the evil of an evildoer who is not near to a person does not cause that person any bad - even though he is an evildoer to the Heavens - unless he befriends him. So did he write in Midrash Shmuel in the name of the pious teacher, Rabbi Yosef ibn Shoshan. And in the name of the teacher, Rabbi Yehuda Lirma, he wrote that he was precise [about] why it said, \"distance\" (<i>harchek</i>), which is from the causative [form] and not say, \"distance oneself\" (<i>hitrachek</i>), which is from the reflexive form. And he said [that the reason is] that if a person comes to live next to the bad neighbor because he doesn't know him, that one should distance him and warn him not to dwell [near] him. Up to here [are his words.] And in my eyes it appears that in both of the [cases here], the teacher adopted the language of Scripture. With distancing, as it is stated (Proverbs 5:8), \"Distance from upon her your path;\" and you do not find <i>mitrachek</i> as a causative expression in all of Scripture. And with befriending, as it is stated (II Chronicles 20:37), \"With your making friends with Achaziyahu the Lord breached your acts.\" And that is as [the mishnah] ends, \"and do not despair of punishment,\" which it  as it is in this verse [where the punishment comes at the end]. ", 
                    "<b>\"and do not despair of punishment:\"</b> And it does not say that he should worry about punishment, since such a thing is a bad trait - the one who worries about punishment; but [rather], \"do not despair of punishment.\" Which is what Haman did when he relied upon his great wealth, and in the blink of an eye, his success reversed itself upon him. And this is [the meaning] of the expression, 'do not despair' - Derekh Chaim. "
