But He made it such that that \"firmament\" that separates would have the power to stop and prevent the vaporous portion from descending - that's the \"waters which are above the firmament\", such that the transformed atmospheric portion would descend, while the vaporous would remain in its original place.

The reason why the Torah added the word כנגדו is that whenever one confronts someone of equal power, moral and ethical weight, such a confrontation is termed נגד. It is a head-on collision of will. When the two parties disagreeing are not of equal power, or moral/ethical weight, the confrontation is termed as one being עולה or יורד one of the adversaries either prevailing or losing in such an encounter. It is in this sense that we have to understand such statements as משה שקול כנגד כל ישראל, “that Moses was the equal of the entire Jewish people.” (Mechilta Yitro 1)  However, the Torah did not mean for woman to be 100% equal to man, else how could the man expect her to perform household chores for him, etc.?

                "והנחש, another word for Satan, which itself is a way of describing the evil urge. (Baba Batra 16). The reason why this evil urge is compared to a serpent is that just like a serpent which makes itself as invisible as possible, blending in with its environment, and yet causes more damage than the most prominently visible obstacles, so the evil urge lurks where one does not suspect to find it. It is a common practice to name phenomena according to other well known phenomena, such as calling the king “lion,” to show what is expected of a king, i.e. strength, fearlessness, etc. (compare Jeremiah 4,7 “the lion has come up from his thicket,” a reference to King Nevuchadnezzar) Also in Jeremiah 8,17 Israel’s enemies are referred to as נחשים צפעונים אשר אין להם לחש, “adders which cannot be charmed.” G’d, using a metaphor, calls the evil urge נחש, in our verse. Anything or anybody who leads Israel into sin is termed נחש. The reason why a serpent has been chosen for such a metaphor is that it is a creature whose potential harm is huge, whereas its potential benefit to man is minimal. Moreover, seeing that its visibility is minimal, it is similar to the evil urge who never attacks frontally, and often poses as friend rather than as enemy. Our sages in Pirkey de Rabbi Eliezer chapter 13 already enlarged on this metaphor by describing Samael as riding the serpent, meaning “taking advantage of this power of imagination.” The insidious nature of the evil urge consists of the fact that it conjures up in our imagination something desirable, which because of its desirability we rationalize into considering as harmless, harbouring no physical or spiritual danger for us. Greed, lust, combined with one’s imagination is a powerful tool for leading man into sin. Unless man is able to harness the power of reason against such insidious attempts to trick him into disobedience against G’d by giving in to his desire for gratification of his senses, he will fall victim to the evil urge’s machinations. When our sages (Jerusalem Talmud Berachot 1.8) said עינא ולבא סרסורי דחטאה, “the eyes and the heart are agents of sin,” they referred to the warning against the evil urge we recite twice daily in the last section of the keriyat shema.

Even this type of repentance was wrung from him only after G’d had pressured him to display penitence. He was embittered, and this is what prompted him to exclaim that the severity of his sin was such there was no hope to obtain forgiveness which would protect him against retribution in kind. The matter is similar to Saul’s failure in killing Agag, King of Amalek. Saul had said to Samuel: “I have sinned,” only after Samuel had insisted that he make a confession of having failed to carry out G’d’s instructions. (Samuel I 15,24) Samuel had had to tell Saul that G’d had despised him as a future leader of the Jewish people before he could prevail on Saul to acknowledge his wrongdoing. (Samuel I 15,24)\n"

Anyone who is prepared to kill someone is called הורג, as for instance, in Hoseah 9,13 ואפרים להוציא אל הורג בניו, “Ephrayim too must bring out his children to his slayers.” The word שבעתים means “twice seven times,” as in Proverbs 6,31 ונמצא ישלם שבעתים, “when he is found out he must pay twice sevenfold.” G’d decreed therefore that when someone killed half the human race, or at least a third of the human race, the appropriate vengeance would involve a twice sevenfold penalty. This would manifest itself in such a slayer being a restless wanderer on earth for seven generations. Such a life is considered worse than death. When David prays in Psalms 59,12אל תהרגם פן ישכחו עמי הניעמו בחילך, “do not kill them lest my people will forget them; make them wanderers seeing it is in Your power,” he meant that they be killed only at the end of seven generations. David wanted the punishment of his enemies to last. If they would all die and disappear at once their absence would soon be forgotten. Kayin got his deserts at the end of seven generations as we know from traditional sources in Tanchuma 10.\n"

Noach’s personal merits did not entitle him to demand from G’d that He also save them on the strength of his merits. They required special חנינה, clemency  (based on Bereshit Rabbah 29,1. According to the verse in Ezekiel 14,14-19 G’d discusses with the prophet the three men Noach, Daniel, and Job as possessing sufficient merit to be saved themselves, but as not having sufficient merit to entitle their families to be saved [the rider there is if these three men had lived in the (wicked) city described by G’d to Ezekiel, the men of the city would not have been saved by their presence.] The reason why these individuals were not as effective in saving the people around them was that they were devout and pious for themselves without trying to use their influence to convert their contemporaries to adopt their lifestyles. This is what made them basically different from Avraham, Moses and Samuel and others like them, who went out to win converts. This is what the sages in Pessachim 87 had in mind when they described such people. The Talmud distinguishes between people who זכו ללמוד ולא זכו ללמד, “acquired the merit of studying Torah, but did not acquire the merit of disseminating Torah knowledge.” [Rashi in the Talmud contrasts Daniel’s activities in Eylam (the country of which Shushan was the capital) with those of Ezra in Babylon. The former, while learning Torah, did not teach it, the latter both learned and taught with very beneficial results. Ed.] A righteous person who keeps perfecting himself is entitled to being saved personally, but he is not entitled thereby to save others on his account. While Noach did rebuke the men of his time, he did not travel the extra mile to try and convert them to do good. Our sages in Berachot 19 comment that “if you see a Torah scholar who was guilty of something improper during the day, do not accuse him of anything in your mind during the following night for surely he has done teshuvah in the interval.”\n"

All the time periods mentioned in this verse will somehow be related to the position of the sun at different times during the year. It would be different from before the deluge. Whereas prior to the deluge the sun had remained at a fixed distance relative to the earth all year round, its orbit being circular, resulting in eternal spring in the populated parts of the earth, now there would be all these changes, though at predetermined intervals, resulting in alternating seasons of relative warmth and cold due to the elliptical nature of the sun’s orbit [Although the author lived approximately at the time of Copernicus having determined that the earth moves around the sun instead of being the center of our galaxy, the basic concept even according to the ancient world view does not invalidate the author’s description of antediluvian and postdiluvian climatic conditions. Ed.. כל ימי הארץ, until such time as G’d would correct this deterioration in living conditions on earth due to the effect of the deluge. This “correction” is what the prophet Isaiah 66,22 had in mind when he spoke of the הארץ החדשה אשר אני עושה, “the new earth which I am going to make.” In that future foreseen by the prophet, the sun will once more orbit like a circle instead of like an ellipsis, a configuration responsible for the uneven temperatures on earth during different parts of the year. At that time, the whole vegetation on earth will undergo an upgrading, the curse earth experienced both after Adam’s sin and after Kayin’s murder of his brother Hevel being lifted. Conditions of length of human life will revert to what they had been before the deluge, as the prophet said that a נער, a youth, if he dies at a hundred years old will be considered as having died in his adolescence and more verses there describing this future.
