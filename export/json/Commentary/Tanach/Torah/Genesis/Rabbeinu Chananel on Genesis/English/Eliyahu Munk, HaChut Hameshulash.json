                "ויראו בני האלוהים את בנות האדם כי טובות הנה, ויקחו להם נשים מכל אשר בחרו. We have already explained that the noun אלוהים is a noun which is sometimes applied to G’d, and sometimes to certain people, and sometimes to phenomena which some people worship even though they have nothing divine about them, In Genesis 1,1 בראשית ברא אלוקים, it is clearly a reference to G’d. In Genesis 20,3 ויבא אלוהים אל אבימלך, it is a reference to an angel, seeing that he carried out a mission on behalf of G’d. In Exodus 22,8 עד האלוהים יבא דבר שניהם, it is a reference to a judge, a human being. The term is also applied to select human beings of a spiritually high level, such as when David quotes G’d in Psalms 82,6 אני אמרתי אלהים אתם, I used to say that you (man) are “divine,” (until you sinned). In our verse here, the Torah in speaking of בני האלוהים, refers to the elite of the human species at the time. In our verse it is a reference to the male elite, the judges."

                "והיו ימיו מאה ועשרים שנה, it is possible that G’d extended their life spans for another 120 years, seeing the measure of their sin was not yet full. We have the Torah on record as the Emorites’ measure of sin not being complete, and that as a result of this the Israelites could not yet dispossess them (Genesis 15,16).  Abusing one’s G’d given tzelem is something that cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely. David already summed this up in Psalms 82,6 when he quoted G’d as saying: אני אמרתי אלוהים אתם ובני עליון כלכם, אכן כאדם תמותון, “I had said that you are all divine beings, sons of the most High; all of you, but you shall die as men do, etc.”"

The words וגם אחרי כן mean that even after the deluge there continued to be such gigantic specimen of human beings. The verse speaks of different periods, commencing with a reference to the בני האלוהים who took as their wives from the בנות האדם. These were the people who had originally made a name for themselves due to their size. "

                "The reason why we have two verses in both of which G’d is reported as speaking (separately) although no mention is made of Avram making any response in between, is that the first verse commencing with ויאמר was not a verbalised version of what G’d “said,” but describes what he thought. Such constructions are not unique, other examples occurring in Genesis 27,41 ויאמר עשו בלבו, “Esau said in his heart, etc.” It is reported as Esau having said something, else how could his mother have heard it? Solomon, in Kohelet 2,1 also uses the word אמרתי when describing something he thought rather than something he had actually said."

                "ותאמר שרי אל אברם חמסי עליך, the meaning of the words חמסי עליך is revealed when the angel tells Hagar to go back to Sarai her mistress and to submit to her oppression (16,9). The Torah, at this stage, had covered up the change in Sarah's attitude toward Hagar. Sarai had become completely dependent on Hagar as a result of her having become pregnant. Previously, in the mistress-maid relationship it was the maid who had been dependent on her mistress. Avram had accused her of committing a criminal act by oppressing Hagar. By refusing her services as a maid, Hagar was further encouraged to treat her mistress as her inferior. As a result, Sarai now challenged Avram, blaming him for her reduction in status. She therefore demanded that G'd Himself intervene to show that it was really His will that she now be subordinate to Hagar. This is the reason for the dot on the word וביניך. The point is that Sarai did not want such Divine judgment to cause Avram harm. In the event, the angel told Hagar that Sarai had been correct in her treatment of her when he told her to go back and to submit to Sarai's harsh treatment of her."

                "ולישמעאל שמעתיך ... ונתתיו לגוי גדולת. We see from our historical records that this prophecy came true after a delay of 2333 years. [Avraham was circumcised in the year 2047 according to Seder hadorot and the Mohammedan faith originated in the year 4384, exactly 2333 years later.] This delay was not due to sins of the original Ishmaelites. They had been looking forward to the fulfillment of this prophecy for all these years. We lost our independence due to our sins, however. G'd set a time of 1305 years (according to Daniel) until our redeemer would come. We must certainly continue to look forward to our glorious destiny and not despair if the Ishmaelites had not despaired after over 2000 years. (Rabbeinu Bachya) To indicate that this “divorce” was only due to fear, the Torah describes Sarah’s status as והיא בעולת בעל, “she had a husband.” The divorce bill was therefore not fully effective. It was this status which enabled Avimelech to protest to G’d: הגוי גם צדיק תהרוג, “are You going to kill an innocent person? Conditional divorces were not part of the legislation practiced among gentiles, so why should he have had to consider such a clause? He considered himself a righteous person for not having sexually molested Sarah. In addition, he had every reason to believe that Sarah was unattached, as both Avraham and Sarah had described their relationship as that of brother and sister. Such assurances had been given by both of them repeatedly (compare Rabbeinu Bachya))",

This was because He told him that he would sire a son after having become old, similar to a tree of which it is written that even “an old tree still has hope of producing new branches even if it has been cut down, it will renew itself, its shoots will not cease, if its roots are old in the earth and its stump dies in the ground. At the scent of water it will bud and produce branches like a sapling.”(Job 14,7-9) Furthermore, the righteous have been compared to trees, as we know from Psalms 1,3 והיה כעץ שתול על פלגי מים, “he will be as a tree planted besides streams of water,” (quoted by Rabbeinu Bachya in the name of Rabbeinu Chananel in his commentary on Genesis 18,1)"

All of what was written in the written Torah was included in what the people heard at Mount Sinai, as well as all that G’d taught Moses while he was on that mountain. Just as there is no difference between the specific commandment the people had heard, i.e. the Ten Commandments, and the remainder of the written Torah, so there is no difference [in the authenticity and binding nature Ed.] of the commandments not spelled out in the written Torah, but handed down by the sages orally from generation to generation.

                "ויאמר לבן טוב תתי אתה לך מתתי אתה לאיש אחר, even though giving her to another man [presumably someone with liquid assets, and she would not have to wait for seven years to be married, Ed.] would also be good. Man without a woman, a wife, or a woman without a husband are both not considered as טוב as a “good situation.” (based on Jerusalem Talmud Berachot 9, but expressed in negative terms, i.e. that being single is not good, intolerable.) This reflects what G’d said in Genesis 2,18 that it was not a good situation for Adam to be solitary, without a mate, without a wife. The term טוב  is not an absolute, objective term, but is often used to describe a relative situation, i.e. “better than.”  Even when used in such a context, it may not necessarily be relative to one other choice, but could be relative to a variety of choices, some bad, some relatively good when compared to the bad choice but relatively bad when compared to the best alternative. The author quotes from Lamentations 4,9 and Kohelet 4,17 as well as from Proverbs 15,17 as well as from  Kohelet 5,4 and Kohelet 4,2-3 to illustrate how the word טוב is used in different contexts, generally as a comparative to an alternative. According to Rabbeinu Bachya’s understanding of Rabbeinu Chananel, Lavan meant to say that although a good case could be made for giving Rachel in marriage to someone else, in fact such a choice might be considered superior, he was agreeable to Yaakov’s proposal.

The same argument had been used by Yoash who told his father that if his deity, the baal, was really capable of avenging himself, he should do so himself instead of letting his human worshipper become his defender. (Judges 6,31) Similar arguments are reflected in Ezekiel 28,9 where the prophet predicts the downfall of the King of Tzor (Tyre) who had declared himself a god. He ridicules this “god” as saying to his murderer: “I am a god!” (quoted by Rabbeinu Bachya). "

                "הבנות בנותי והבנים בני והצאן צאני, Lavan deliberately bent the truth when he said: “and the sons are mine.” A grandfather cannot say of his grandchildren by his daughters that they belong to him. What our sages meant when they said that “grandchildren are like children (Yevamot 62) referred only to the grandsons who are sons of sons, not to grandsons who are children of one’s daughters. He also twisted the truth when he said that the flocks (of Yaakov) were his (Lavan’s) flocks. He had first given them to Yaakov as compensation for his labour. Lavan was similarly legally wrong when he added: וכל אשר אתה רואה לי הוא, “all that you (Yaakov) see is really mine.” This is what Yaakov had in mind when said to him in verse 37: “when you checked out and rummaged in all of my things, what did you find that belonged to you?” Lavan had not replied to this. The entire situation reminds one of what ben Haddad had said to Achav King of Israel, (Kings I 20,3) “your silver and gold are mine, your wives and children who are good are mine.” Achav had replied (verse 7) that Ben Haddad’s words revealed that he was bent on doing harm and did not have a legal argument to support his claim. Lavan also had no legal claim so that he was forced to reply to Yaakov’s challenge “why did you chase after me?” “I came to see my daughters, who are my daughters.” "

                "Yaakov included all the 13 attributes G’d revealed to Moses in Exodus 34, 6-7 in his prayer here. The words אלקי אברהם ואלוקי יצחק represented the first two of G’d’s attributes, i.e. “mercy and justice.” The words שוב לארצך G’d had said and which Yaakov quotes, refer to the third attribute, the one called רחום in Exodus. The words ואטיבה עמך correspond to the attribute חנון in Exodus, i.e. loving kindness totally unearned by the recipient. The words ארך אפים in the list given to Moses is represented in Yaakov’s prayer by the word קטונתי. Yaakov meant that but for G’d’s long lasting patience, he could not have endured. The word is reminiscent of the line in Amos 7,5 חדל נא מי יקום יעקב כי קטן הוא, “Oh Lord, refrain! How will Yaakov survive, he is so small!”", 
                " The words מכל החסדים ומכל האמת correspond to the words ורב חסד ואמת in the list of G’d’s attributes in Exodus. The words ועתה הייתי לשני מחנות in our verse correspond to the words נוצר חסד לאלפים in the parallel paragraph in Exodus. G’d has preserved the חסד performed by both Avraham and Yitzchok to be credited to the account of their grandson Yaakov. The words אלפים (plural), correspond to שני מחנות, 2 camps.", 
                "הצילני נא מיד אחי, these words correspond to the words נושא עון in Exodus, meaning that the sin has not caused Yaakov’s downfall.",

                "כי ירא אנכי, these words correspond to the word וחטאה in the list of attributes in Exodus. It is a minor type of sin, the one committed inadvertently.", 
                "ואתה אמרת, these words and their continuation correspond to the word ונקה in the list of G’d’s attributes revealed to Moses in Exodus 34,7.\n"

                "עזים מאתים ותישים עשרים, when we add up all the animals that Yaakov sent to Esau on this occasion they total 550. As a result the kingdom of Esau preceded the kingdom of Israel by 550 years. (Rabbeinu Bachya) [it is not easy to reconcile these numbers with the year in which Israel asked the prophet Samuel to appoint a king for them. This is assumed to have occurred in 2883, whereas the Exodus occurred in 2448. if the Exodus occurred 400 years after the birth of Yitzchok in 2048 and Esau founded his kingdom prior to Yitzchok’s death at 180 years of age, (2228) it will be seen that there is a discrepancy here of maximally 105 years.

                "לא יקרא עוד שמך יעקב כי אם ישראל יהיה שמך. This means that G’d gave him an additional name to his existing one. The word עוד means the same as בלבד, exclusively.    G’d informed Yaakov that henceforth he would have two names, used alternatively. We find something similar in Jeremiah 3,16 לא יאמרו עוד ארון ברית ה', where it also means that henceforth the Holy Ark would not only be referred to as ארון ברית ה'. What was meant was that henceforth the site of the Holy Ark would not be the exclusive site for the Presence of the Shechinah, but that the entire city of Jerusalem would have a similarly holy status. This is the meaning of: בעת היא יראו לירשלים כסא ה' “at such a time they will refer to the city of Jerusalem as G’d’s throne” (verse 17 in the above mentioned chapter in Jeremiah). This then is the meaning of כי אם ישראל יהיה שמך,i. Sometimes the name Yaakov would be used, other times the name Yisrael. Proof that this is correct is found in Isaiah 48,12 where the prophet uses both names simultaneously, שמע אלי יעקב וישראל מקוראי, as well as in Jeremiah 46,28 אל תירא עבדי יעקב ואל תחת ישראל, “do not fear My servant Yaakov, nor be afraid Yisrael.” (quoted by Rabbeinu Bachya)"
