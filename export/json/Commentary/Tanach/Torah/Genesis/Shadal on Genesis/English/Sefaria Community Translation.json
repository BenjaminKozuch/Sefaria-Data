                "<b>\"Let there be (<i>yehi</i>) luminaries:\"</b> When the [verb], being, is before the noun, it does not always adhere to the gender and number [of the noun]; as it is like an anonymous (<i>impersonale</i>) verb. It is like in French, <i>il y aura, il y a</i>; and as in (Numbers 9:6) \"And there was (<i>vayehi</i>) people,\" and (Deuteronomy 22:23) \"If there is (<i>yehieh</i> which is masculine) a virgin maiden.\"", 
                "<b>Luminaries:</b> The stars - all the ones that are visible to our eyes - are included in this name, since they all shine upon us, if [dimly], if [brightly].", 
                "<b>\"In the firmament of the heavens:\"</b> In the firmament that is called the heavens, [meaning in the firmament which is [our] heavens. And this is one use of the relational form (<i>smikhut</i>), as in the 'River of Euphrates' (<i>Parat</i>) [means] the river that is called Euphrates; [and] (Jeremiah 14:17) \"the virgin of the daughter of my people\" [means] the virgin which is the daughter of my people; [and] (Isaiah 37:22) \"the virgin of the daughter of Zion\" [means that she] is the daughter of Zion. [And so too are understood the next few verses:] (I Kings 10:15), \"the people of trade;\" [and] (Judges 19:22) \"the people of the sons of lawlessness;\" and (Isaiah 1:4) \"the seed of evildoers;\" and (Isaiah 65:23) \"the seed of those blessed by God.\" And so [too], 'God of Hosts' [means] God who is the Hosts. (And so too Rabbi Avraham Ibn Ezra wrote below [verse 31], \"'the day of the sixth [<i>yom hashishi</i>]' - the day that is the sixth.\" Here too, the firmament of the heavens [means] the firmament that is the heavens.)", 
                "<b>\"To separate between the day and the night:\"</b> That which was the will of God at the beginning and without an intermediary (since on the first three days the light would serve for a certain time and afterwards leave and the darkness would take its place, and all of this was through the actions of God and through his proclamation),  [and] now it would be through the luminaries. And all of this was to make known that the sun and all the hosts of the heavens are only His servants who follow His will.", 
                "<b>\"And they will be for signs:\"</b> The luminaries will be the cause of the signs of the heavens, as per the explanation of (Jeremiah 10:4), \"of the signs of the heavens do not be afraid\" (Rabbi Avraham Ibn Ezra); and the explanation of signs is indicators. And the nations of the world called them this because they believed that they were indicators of what will come in the future; and it is as Yirmiyahu said [in the verse just cited], that the nations feared from them. And behold, it would have been fitting for Him to first say, \"and they will be for days and years and appointed times,\" and at the end He would mention the signs, [since] they are only occasional, except that He wanted to start with the [most] important (like below, verse 21); as the signs are the main intention of this half of the verse, since the Holy One, blessed be He, wanted to let Israel know that even the signs of the heavens are only like the days and years - all of them are structured by His will, like the other laws of nature: the day and the night, 'the planting and the harvest and the coldness and the heat.' And just like the day and the night and the planting and the harvest don't have their own specific gods and do not inform of the future, so too [is it] with the signs of the heavens. And since the belief that one could learn about the future from the signs of the heavens and from solar and lunar eclipses was widespread among the nations and [nonetheless] Moshe (and after him, Yirmiyahu) pushed off this this mistake and made known that they are natural [occurrences] like the days and the years; behold this is a great proof that the Torah is of divine origin (<i>min hashamayim</i>). And one should not wonder, why didn't the Holy One, blessed be He, want to reveal to His people the other errors to which [man] had become accustomed. As the other errors did not cause damage to the fundamental principles of faith nor to the rectification of human character traits. [But] this is not the case of faith in the signs of the heavens, as it is damaging - like faith in fortune telling and similar matters that were forbidden by the Torah - as it weakens a person in his [Divine] service in which he toils and it fills his heart with vain things and removes his trust in God.  .", 
                "<b>\"And for appointed times (<i>moadim</i>):\"</b> <i>Moed</i> is said about anything that comes back around at specific times. And so holidays are called <i>moadim</i> based on their regularity. And so too (Psalms 104:19), \"He made the moon for <i>moadim</i>;\" as it is visible and hidden at set times. And so too are all the luminaries the cause of <i>moadim</i> and the celebration of set times that come back around, and especially of days and years. "

                "<b>\"And they shall be for luminaries, etc.:</b> It added that their light and radiance should reach the earth, since it was possible that they should show light in the heavens and do all of the acts that are mentioned, without their shining upon the earth. (Ramban)"

                "<b>The two great luminaries</b>: The sun and the moon, since both of them shine upon the earth more than the other stars. And from this perspective for which they are called luminaries (meaning that the emphasis is on the effect of their light, not the light itself), they are greater than the other ones like them. And even though the moon, in terms of the size of its mass is smaller than other stars, and even though the moon does not have any light of its own at all, the Torah did not speak except from the perspective of people; and behold, we receive much light from the moon and, hence, it is a great luminary.", 
                "<b>The great luminary and the small luminary:</b> Even though the light of [both of] them is greater than that of the other stars, they are different from each other: as the light of one is greater than the light of the other. And one is big and one is small from the perspective of light that we receive from them.", 
                "<b>To rule the day... to rule the night:</b> Not that it should have rulership over the lowly beings, but [rather] that the day should be under the the rulership of the sun and the night under the rulership of the moon, [meaning] that the light of the day be from the sun and the light of the night from the moon. And this requires further study. And what also requires further study is that it would have been fit for the <i>etnach</i> (a cantillation mark indicating a slight pause) to be under [the word,] the night. (My student, Yitzchak Yehuda Kleinaberger) And see below, verse 18. "
