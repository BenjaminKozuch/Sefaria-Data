                "Then we will see what will become of his dreams: R. Yitzhak said: This verse says \"expound upon me.\" is the Divine Spirit that is saying this: they are saying \"let us kill him,\" but, the verse concludes \"Let us see what will become of his dreams,\" let us see who's words will be fulfilled, yours or mine? It is impossible that it was they who said   \"Let us see what will become of his dreams,\" for once they kill him, his dreams would have no meaning."
