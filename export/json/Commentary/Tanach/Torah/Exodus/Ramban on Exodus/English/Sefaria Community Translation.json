                "The reason for \"And these are the names\" is that the verse wants to tell the topic of the exile from the time of their descent to Egypt because then was the initial exile, as I have explained. Therefore, it returns to the original topic which [originally was mentioned] in the verse, \"And [Jacob] brought all his descendants with him to Egypt\" (Genesis 46:7). Afterwards it says there, \"And these are the names of the children of Israel who came to Egypt etc.\" This very verse it what is being repeated here, because even though they are two separate books (Genesis and Exodus), the story is connected with things that"

                "ותרא SHE SAW THAT HE WAS GOOD AND SHE HID HIM: The explanation that she hid him because of [something special] that she saw in him is false. All babies elicit the compassion of their mothers. Rather one must explain [the verb] SHE SAW (ותרא) like in the verse (Gen. 1:31), \"God saw (יארע) all that he had made and found it very good.\" There the phrase means that [God] looked and examined all His works and His actions that He had done to see whether there was something to correct therein; everything was proper and correct. Here also, since Moses was born [prematurely] after [a pregnancy of only] six months--just as we find that Samuel was born [after a six-month pregnancy, as it is written (I Sam. 1:20) לתקופות הימים i.e. after two tequfot and two [more] days.", 
                "That is why she [Moses' mother] was able to hide him for three months, for the Egyptians used to check the pregnant women [only at the anticipated end of a full term pregnancy] at the end of nine months.", 
                "Accordingly, [since he was born so prematurely] she examined him when he was born to see whether he was a stillborn that need not be hidden. But she saw that he was fine and good-looking, for his signs of maturity, which are his hair and fingernails--as we learned in Yevamot (80b )--were completed. So she knew that he was capable of surviving and therefore she hid him for three months--i.e. until the end of [what would have been a pregnancy of nine months, which is the standard length of pregnancy for most women. When they came to check on her either she told them that the child had been a stillborn or that the Egyptians had already thrown him into the river. "

                "..I did not understand why Hashem had to do miracles for Moshe, because Moshe trusted that it was Hashem speaking to him, (why did he have to prove himself.) It would have been appropriate to say, the stick that you are holding in your hand, throw down in front of them and it will become a snake. So too for the second sign, it should have been done the way it was done in the third: take the water when youre in front of them. And therefore the rabbi say that the first one was a sign that he was speaking gossip and the second one was to punish him for it. ", 
                "And that is the reason Moshe ran away from the snake because he was scared that he might be punished and the snake would bit him, and most people run away from things that are harmful to them. Even though, he knew that if he will be in G-d's favor he will not need to be saved. ", 
                "And maybe, even though Hashem the creator of the world came to him, Hashem wanted to show these symbols in the change of nature. In order to strengthen the matter and the belief in Moshe's heart. And he should know truthfully that only via G-d's hand that new things will happen in this world. And it was enough for Moshe to just show him two things and there was no water there, so therefore he commanded that the sign should be done when theres water, in the eyes of the Jewish people. "

Another opinion, with another hand of who you want them to be sent for my destiny is not to lead them into the land of Israel and to be their redeemer in the future. You have a lot of other messengers, these are the words of Rashi. And Onkelos says, send it in the hand of someone who is appropriate to go (like a general or ambassador), meaning, send with someone who can speak eloquently who is appropriate for this honorable task. And don't send someone who cannot speak well, who you will have to talk for. Because it is not a way of respect to send someone who has problems speaking, no ones going to listen when you speak to the king and it will be disgust in their eyes. ",

He would have never found it in his heart to rise up and speak to the king and be glorified. It is not in is character to say Hashem sent me and not to take the Jewish people out of Egypt and not to be the king."

                "God appeared to the Patriarchs as the Prime Mover behind all natural events.  His miracles were apparent to them without recourse to violating the natural order.  In times of famine He redeemed them from death and in war from the sword and provided them with wealth and honor and every good thing.  These things, like all the promises in the Torah of blessing and curse, are not meted out to a man as his due, as a reward for good deeds and punishment for sin.  They constitute miracles (of Divine grace).  Man's own deeds do not automatically give rise to favorable effects or otherwise.  But the reward and punishment alluded to in the Torah in this world are in the nature of miracles, hidden ones which the onlookers regard as the workings of nature.  But in reality they are the providential allocation of reward and punishment.  God said to Moses: I appeared to the Patriarchs as One who assists His chosen ones through the might of my hand (but without violating nature).  By My ineffable name expressing the essence of all existence (Exodus 3:14) I was not known to them to introduce innovations changing the natural course of events.  Therefore tell the Children of Israel that I am the Lord and let them know My great name through which I shall perform for them wonders that they may know that I am the Lord who does these things."

                "Because it is close - And it would be easy to return on that same path to Egypt, and there are many Aggadic Midrashim [about this]. [The above is] the language of Rashi. And it is also the understanding of Rabbi Avraham (a.k.a Ibn Ezra): Because the reason that 'Hashem did not lead them on the path [through] the land of the Philistines' was because 'it was close' and they would regret [leaving] and return to Egypt immediately. But according to my understanding, if it is like their words (Rashi and Ibn Ezra) 'Because Hashem said' would have been first [in the verse], but the verse says \"Hashem led them not by the way of the land of the Philistines...for God said: ‘Lest the people regret when they see war, and they return to Egypt.’\". But the correct [understanding] is that it is saying \"Hashem led them not by the way of the land of the Philistines\" which is \"close\" and [it would be] good to lead them on that path, \"because Hashem said, 'Lest the people regret when they see war, and they return to Egypt.'\"", 
                "And the reason for war was that they would pass through to path of the land of the Philistines and the Philistines would not let them pass in peace, and then they would return to Egypt, but on the path of the wilderness, they would not see war until they were in their land; in the land of Sicon and Og, kings of the Emorites that was given to them, and they would be far from Egypt at that time. And the war with Amalek in Rifidim was not worthwhile to return because of it, because they were that passing through [the Amalekims land] but [rather the Amelekim] came from its land and fought with them because of their hatred for them and if they had conceived of returning to Egypt, it would not have helped because [the Amelekim] would have fought them on the road. And also they were [already] far from Egypt on the crooked path that they went on and they didn't know another way [to return]. And the language of Rashi: When they see war - for example, the wars of the Cananim and the Amelekim, if they had went on a straight path, they would have returned. Just like when [Hashem] led them on a crooked path they said, 'Let us take initiative and return to Egypt', if they had went on a simple [path], all the more so [would they have returned]. [The following is a quote from] Michilta. And the reason it says, \"God led them not...But God led the people about, by the way of the wilderness\", is when they traveled from Succot, the pillar of cloud began to go before them, and it did not go by the way of the land of the Philistines, but rather went by the way of the wilderness of Eitam and Yisrael went after it. And the cloud rested in Eitam and they camped there, and [Eitam] is on the border of the wilderness. "

                "And the for [saying] 'And Bnei Yisrael went up armed' - [as if] to say even though Hashem led them around [by] the way of the wilderness, they were scared maybe the Philistines would come upon them, those that lived in the cities close to them, and [therefore] they were armed like those who go to war. And there are those that say [that the reason for the phrase is] that the verse is telling us that they left 'with a raised hand' and they considered themselves redeemed people, and they did not walk like slaves who ran away."

                "\"And Hashem walked before them during the day\" - They already said (Bereishit Rabbah 51:2) that \"Every place that is says '<i>Va'Hahsem</i>' (lit. and Hashem) [it means] him and his court. The Holy, one blessed is He, was with them during the day and his court [was with them] at night.\" If so, the verse is explaining that Hashem dwelt in the cloud and He went before them by day in the pillar of cloud, and at night, his court dwelt in the pillar of fire to light [the way] for them, like the reason [behind the verse] (Numbers 14:14) \"inasmuch as Thou LORD art seen face to face, and Thy cloud standeth over them, and Thou goest before them, in a pillar of cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night\". And I saw in <i>Eleh Shemos Rabbah</i> (Shemot Rabbah 19:6) \"'For ye shall not go out in haste, Neither shall ye go by flight; For the LORD will go before you' (Isaiah 52:12). [This verse implies] in the past My court and I would get before you, as it says, '<i>Va'Hashem</i> went before them by day' but in the future,  I will go alone [before you], as it says, (Isaiah 52:12) 'For the LORD will go before you, And the God of Israel will be your rearward.'\" And the secret [behind] this Midrash is as I have mentioned, because in the first redemption (i.e. the one from Egypt) the Holy one, blessed is He, was with them by day and his court was with them by night. But in the future (lit. the coming future) you will raise [away] the attribute of His court with mercy, and Hashem will walk before them, the singular Hashem, because 'the God of Israel will be your rearward' and 'But the night shineth as the day; The darkness is even as the light.' (Psalms 139:12) because everything [will be dealt] with the unique attribute of mercy. And Rabbi Avraham (a.k.a. Ibn Ezra) says: Because the verse is speaking like the language of people, because the power of Hashem and His messenger [are whom] went with Israel like [the verse] \"That caused His glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses\" (Isaiah 63:12) . And the truth that it is [actually] like [the verse] '' but not like Rabbi Avraham understood from it, and it says so (i.e. proves my point) \"So didst Thou lead Thy people, To make Thyself a glorious name.\" (Isaiah 63:12)"
