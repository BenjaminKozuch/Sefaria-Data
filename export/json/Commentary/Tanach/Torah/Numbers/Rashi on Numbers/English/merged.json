                "These are the journeys - these are the stages. Why are each of the these stages listed? To inform the reader about the kindness of God. For even though there had been a decree that they would wander about in the desert, it was never said that they should perpetually wander for forty years and have no rest. For when one looks at the list there are no more than forty two stages. Remove 14 from that number which were all in the first year before the decree, for “the traveled from Ramses” until they came to Ramatah - for it was from there that the spies were sent, as it says (Numbers 12), “And afterwards the nation traveled from Hazterot etc. “Send for yourself men [to spy]...” And hereit says that they left Hatzerot and camped in Ramatah - this teachers that it is in the Wilderness of Paran. And one must remove from the count another eight journeys which were after the death of Aharon from when they were at Hor HaHar until the reached the plains of Moav in the fortieth year. What emerges from this is that in the entire 38 years of wandering, they did not have to make more than twenty journeys. This interpretation is based on the opinion of Rabbi Moshe HaDarshan.  And Rabbi Tanhuma explained it with a different drasha: This can be compared to a king who had a sick child and he brought him someplace very far to be healed. And once they return home, his father recounts all of the journeys and says, “here we slept, here we were cold, here you had a headache.” [Bamidbar Rabbah]."
