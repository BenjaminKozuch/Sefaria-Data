                "In line with the plain meaning of scripture the verse says, \"Keep the commandments of G-d, His testimonies, and His statues, and in observing them, intend to do what is right and good in his sight only.\" And [the expression in the verse before us] that it may be well with thee is a promise, stating that, when you will do what is good in His eyes, it will be well with you, For G-d does good unto the good, and to them that are upright in their hearts. Our Rabbis have a beautiful midrash on this verse. They have said. [ That which is right and good] refers to a compromise and going beyond the requirement of the letter of the law.\" The Intent of this is as follows: At first he [Moshe] stated that you are to keep his statues and his testimonies which he commanded you, and now that he is stating that even where he has not commanded you, give thought as well, to do what is good and right in his eyes, for he loves the good and the right. Now this is a great principle, for it is impossible to mention in the Torah all aspects of man's conduct with his neighbors and friends, and all his various transactions, and the ordinances or all societies and countries. But since he mentioned many of them- such as , Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer....Thus [a person must seek to refine his behavior[ in every form of activity, until he is worthy of being called \"good and upright\""
