                "When [the Torah] was revealed at Sinai, he received it with its general principles, its particulars and its inferences and there was no law that was to be innovated [later]. And it is as it is found in Torat Cohanim which is cited by Rashi on Leviticus 25:1 at the beginning of Parshat Behar. And to teach this, [the mishna] states \"from Sinai.\" And 'it is not an empty thing,' since, behold, it is a sign of the religion: it is one for its nation, the congregation of Israel that received it. It is complete to its Creator - the students, they are the children of God; what an experienced student is to innovate in the future, all of it was received by Moshe. As it is stated (Deuteronomy 9:10), \"and upon them, as all of the words,\" and as we expound it in Megillah. And see the Tosafot Yom Tov.", 
                "<b>and he passed it on, etc.:</b> As everything that he received, he passed on to Yehoshua. But concerning Moshe, it cannot state that it was passed on to him, since the fiftieth gate [of wisdom] was not passed on to him, as is elucidated in Tractate Rosh Hashanah 21b.", 
                "<b>and the prophets passed it on to the men of the Great Assembly:</b> [Meaning] to say that even though not all of the Assembly were prophets, the entire Torah was passed on to them, etc. But afterwards - as the generations declined - not the entire thing was passed on. But [rather] everyone received it according to his ability. And nonetheless, the [portion of] the Torah that was in his hand was a transmission to him, [that had been passed on] one man from another [going back] to Moshe, our teacher - peace be upon him.", 
                "<b>\"and stand up:\"</b> They [used] an expression of standing, since from the days of Moshe until the days of Rabban Gamliel, they would study while standing and the teacher would sit on a chair (Megillah 21a) - Midrash Shmuel. And it appears to me that the expression, \"and stand up,\" is [meaning to say] to stand them up in understanding the truth of the Torah [and even though there were many students], as this is [something's] standing and establishment, and falsehood has 'no feet,' "

                "And this is difficult to me, since if so, [“on the Torah”] is not a warning at all; and [so] it is not similar to the others. And it appears to me that [\"the Torah\" here] is [referring to] reason and Torah study. And this is [the understanding] of that which is written, “if not for my covenant (which is studied) night and day.” [This is] as the matter is stated (Yehoshua 1), “and you shall reason in it night and day.\" And see Tosafot Yom Tov.", 
                " And in the tractate Megillah 31a, it concludes, “If not for my covenant, etc... I would not have set” - that in the covenant between the pieces, the Holy One, blessed be He, promised that even if the Jews sin, the creation of the world will be preserved in the merit of the sacrifices. And see Tosafot Yom Tom. "

                "<b>The man of Sokho:</b> He was the master of the place that was called Sokho. [This is related to] the expression, \"my man, [the] High Priest.\" ", 
                "<b>\"as servants, etc.:\"</b> He stated it with a [Hebrew letter], kaf that indicates a comparison, and he also repeated his words, \"but rather be, etc.\" and he was precise in his expression and did not say only, \"be, etc.\" and he also called those that serve in order, etc., 'servants;' so that we not err in any way to say that it is forbidden to serve in order, etc., as this is not [so]. Since one who serves thus is also completely righteous and is called a servant of God. (And for naught did Tsadok and Beitos err, but he should have explained it explicitly, that it be explicit for all that hear [it].) But he came to teach that there is a level and status that is greater and that is the one who serves from love. And he came to warn us to also be from those that serve from love. And see Tosafot Yom Tom who wrote about this at length.", 
                "And meaning to say that this is the distinction between a reward and payment. Since payment is what must legally be given. ", 
                "<b>\"not, etc.:\"</b> And a different version of the text is, \"in order not, etc.\" And I did not understand this version, as it is not relevant to say that he should serve in order and on condition that if He would give him a reward, he would not serve Him. And it is not difficult [that] behold also one who serves not in order, etc., knows that in the end the reward will come, and behold he hopes for the reward, [since] this is not [so.] As the one who [truly] serves from love is always coming short in [his] service in his [own] eyes.  And he thinks to himself that he has not served as is fitting to Him, due to his great love for Him, may He be blessed. And just the opposite, he fears for his soul lest he has sinned in his shortcomings in his service and has been guilty. And that [this Mishnah] ends, \"and may the fear of Heaven, etc.,\" [and] called Him with the name, \"Heaven,\" is to say that the fear should not be be a fear of punishment, God forbid, but [rather] a fear (awe) of His greatness, may He be blessed. [This is as] it appears to me - Tosafot Yom Tov."

And that is what it states, \"and neglects the words of Torah\" - Midrash Shmuel.  And there is another precise textual variant [that reads], \"Anyone who increases.\" "

And it was not necessary with an evildoer who is not his neighbor, since he is not close. [Rather,] it only warned him not to befriend him. And it said about the neighbor, \"bad,\" and not, \"evildoer,\" since his being neighbors with an evildoer is bad for [the latter's] neighbor, and his proximity is very harmful. [And] this is not the case when he is not his neighbor. His evil does not cause that person any bad - even though he is an evildoer to the Heavens - unless he befriends him - R. Y. ibn Shoshan. And see Tosafot Yom Tov.",

And this is [the meaning] of the expression, 'do not despair' - Derekh Chaim. "
