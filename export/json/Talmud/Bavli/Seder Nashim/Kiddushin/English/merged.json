Now, that [verse] refers to the seven nations! whence do we know it of other nations? — Scripture saith, ‘For he will turn away [thy son],’ which includes all who may turn [him] away.

One day his wife overheard him. ‘Let me see,’ she reflected, ‘it is so many years that he has separated from me: why then should he say that?’ One day, while he was studying in his garden, she adorned herself with a scarf and strolled in front of him.  ‘Who are you?’ he asked. ‘I am Cheruta, and have returned today,’ she replied. He desired her. Said she to him, ‘Bring me that pomegranate from the uppermost branch.’ He jumped up, went, and brought it to her. When he re-entered his house, his wife was firing the oven,whereupon he went and sat in it. ‘What is this?’ she asked. He told her what had happened.‘It was I,’ she told him; but he paid no heed to her until she gave him proof. ‘Nevertheless,’ said he, ‘my intention was evil.’ That righteous man fasted all his life, until he died from that very death."
