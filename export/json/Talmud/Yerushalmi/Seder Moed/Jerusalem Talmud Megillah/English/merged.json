            "And on the Day of Convocation, \"Seven Weeks\" (Deuteronomy 16:9) A Tanna taught, \"In the Third Month\" (Exodus 19:1). And on the New Year, \"In the Seventh Month.\" (Leviticus 23:23) A Tanna taught \"And The Lord Remembered Sarah\" (Genesis 21:1). And on the Day of Atonement, \"After the Death\".  (Leviticus 16:1) On the first day of the Holiday, read the Chapter of Times in Leviticus (Leviticus 23). And on the other days of the Holiday, read the Sacrifices of the Holiday. (Numbers 29)  Ribbi Jacob Son of Ahi said in the name of Ribbi Yesa “This is to teach you that the world does not stand, except through the sacrifices.”  It was taught over there (Fathers 1:2) “Simon the Righteous was of the remnants of the Great Assembly. He had said ‘On three things the world stands: 1) On Torah, 2) on Worship, 3) and on Distribution of Piety.’”   And the three are mentioned in a single verse (Isaiah 51:15) “And I have put My words in thy mouth, and have covered thee in the shadow of My hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion: 'Thou art My people.’”  And I have put My words in thy mouth: This is the Study of Torah. And have covered thee in the shadow of My hand: This is Distribution of Piety, to teach you that whosoever engages in Torah and in Distribution of Piety merits to sit in the Shade of the Holy One, Blessed be He. Similarly, it says (Psalms 36:8) “How precious is Thy lovingkindness, O God! and the children of men take refuge in the shadow of Thy wings.”  That I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth:  These are the Sacrifices. And say unto Zion: 'Thou art My people.’: Ribbi Hinina son of Papa said, “We have reviewed all of Scripture, and we have not found that the People of Israel is called Zion except in this place, “and say unto Zion: 'Thou art My people.” It was taught over there (Fathers 1:17) “R Simeon son of Gamaliel said on three things the world stands: 1) On Justice, 2) On Truth, 3) On Peace. And all three are one idea, “The making of justice is the making of truth is the making of peace.” Ribbi Mana said “And all three are in one verse (Zechariah 8:16) [These are the things that ye shall do: Speak ye every man the truth with his neighbour] “Execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates”.\n"
