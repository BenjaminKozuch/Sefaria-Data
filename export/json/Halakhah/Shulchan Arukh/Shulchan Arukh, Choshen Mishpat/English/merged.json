            "In these time judges judge the laws of  confessions to a loan, loans, kesuba of a woman, inheritance, gifts, and cases which damage anothers money(assets, or income) because these cases are common always. Case which are not common even though there is a loss of money for example a animal that wounds another animal, or cases which are common but don't have a loss of money  such as paying double (when fined for stealing an item) and such is the case with all fines that the sages instituted like a fine for when someone blows in into his friends ear and scares him, or hits his friend, and so to in any case where they required one to pay more then the principal amount of damage or where you would be required half the damage we don't judge them. they may only be judged by specialist who have smicha in Israel. Except in the case where you pay half the damage for damage caused by pebbles (such as when an animal walks and it kicks up pebbles and they cause damage) because this is a loss of money, and not a fine (a fine is extra punishment to the value of a principle damage) "

            "Anyone who appoints a judge who is not proper and not wise in the wisdom of the Torah and not fitting to be a judge, even though is completely desirable and has other good traits, behold this person who appointed him violates a negative precept. Hagah: And it is forbidden to appoint an ignoramus as a judge with the assumption that he will ask a wise man every time. (B\"Y) And cities that there is not in them wise men who are fitting to be judges, or where they are all ignoramuses, and they need judges to rule between them so that they not go to courts of idol worshipers, we appoint the best and wisest among them (based on the opinion of the people of the city), even though they are not fitting to be judges. And since the people of the city accepted (them) upon themselves, nobody else is able to disqualify them. And similarly, every community is able to accept upon themselves a Bais Din even though they are not fitting according to the Torah. (B\"Y quoting Tshuvos HaRashb\"a) And any judge who was appointed because of silver or gold, it is forbidden to stand before him. And not only that, rather it is a commandment to belittle and deride him."

(In these cases) on the eve of Shabbat the worker goes home early so he can fill a barrel of water and roast a small fish and light the Shabbat candles (Tur 331:5 based on the Talmud Yerushalmi). If there was no custom in the city but the majority of the men in the city come from an area where there is a custom, we go according to the custom of the city from which they come. If they came from a place where the custom is to work from dawn to dusk to a place where that is not the custom, or the reverse, we go according to the custom of the place in which they were hired (Nemukei Yosef on the beginning of Chapter 7 of Bava Metzia, \"One Who Hires Worker\", based on the Talmud Yerushalmi). Something is not a custom unless it a common practice and has been done many times, however, something which has been done only once or twice is not considered a custom (Rivash siman 475).]"
