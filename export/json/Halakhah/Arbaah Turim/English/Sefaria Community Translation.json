Therefore, before one's hands are washed, one must refrain from touching the mouth, the nose, the ears, and the eyes with one's hand, as the evil spirit rests upon them. And if one does not have water, one should wipe his hands on a stone or anything that cleans, and bless, \"\"Blessed are you Adonai, our God, King of the universe, that has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us regarding the cleanliness of hands.\""
