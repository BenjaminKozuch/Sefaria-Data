            "(1) IN ORDER TO SERVE HIS CREATOR - because for this was man created. As the text says \"Every one that is called by My name, and whom I have created for My glory... \" And even if his Evil Inclination advises him in the winter and says 'How will you arise in the morning, because it is very cold?' or in the summer advises and says 'How will you arise from your bed, when you still have not slept to your satisfaction?' Overcome him and do not listen to him, and think to yourself: If I had needed to arise to appear before a king of flesh and blood, how carefully and zealously would I arise and awaken in order to prepare myself for this service? All the more so and obviously, before the King of kings the Holy One blessed is He. ", 
            "(2) THE DAWN - A secret in written in the Two Tablets of the Covenant, to connect the day and night with Torah and prayer, whether its morning or whether its evening. Immediately upon waking up from sleep if he doesn't plan to sleep more, he should wash his hands, even if he is does so while still lying down. All the more so, he shouldn't walk four cubits without having washed his hands. He must be very careful in this regard. And the holy Zohar emphasizes the great punishment for this, for leaving the spirit of impurity on himself. In any case, he should not God forbid violate any other prohibition in order to not have a gap before washing his hands; like for instance, to stop himself from urinating for this purpose, or to take water which his friend had prepared for himself, if its not obvious to him that he will immediately be able to give him other [water] in exchange. And there are those who fail in this. And if he sees that the water is far and he doesn't have someone to bring it close to him, it is the custom of some of the observant ones (ba'alei ha'nefesh) to walk little by little in increments shorter than four cubits. The Sha'arei Teshuvah write about this that its better if hes able to run and not allow the spirit of evil to linger on his hands. There are those who say in regards to this idea that the entire house is like his four cubits, but we shouldn't rely on this unless in a time of pressure. If when he arises at night he sees that he does not have enough water to wash his hands three times as it appropriate to rid the spirit of impurity, nevertheless he should not God forbid forgo his Torah study because of this until daylight, but rather he should wash his hands a little or clean his hands on whatever he has to wash, make a blessing, and learn, as per the law of the Talmud and Torah. ", 
            "(3) WHEN THE GROUP IS PRAYING - Even though the time for prayer has not passed, in any case he is commanded to pray with a group. This is elaborated below at the end of Seif Katan 9.", 
            "THE RIGHTEOUS - He should paint in his soul/mind always how to stand before Hashem blessed be his name, because The Holy One's glory fills all the land. And it is written in the name of the Arizal, that he should always paint the name YHV'H next to his eyes in the essence of Fear of Heaven, for this is Y-H-V-H (with the vowelization of the word Fear [YIR'AH]), for this is the secret of \"I shall set the Lord before me always\" and the is greatly benefits one's Fear of Heaven. There are those who are accustomed because of this to have parchments of a Menorah drawn inside their Siddurim, on which it is written \"I shall set the Lord...\" Etc..., with the Four Letters and other Names, and this Menorah is called \"I have set\" [\"Shiviti\"]. And the purpose is in order to remind one not to engage in idle chatter during God fearing prayer. And it is written in the Gates of Repentance [Sha'arei Teshuvah] ", 
            "(5)  BEFORE MEN - Never the less, he should never fight with them, because the quality of brazenness is very despicable, and its not appropriate to use it at all, even in the service of the Lord blessed be his name, because he the will acquire the attribute in his personality even in matters which are not in the service of Hashem. ", 
            "THAT ARE MOCKING YOU - If he's an average person who in the company of great men, he shouldn't be embarrassed to learn or to do the mitzvah. If its possible for him to perform it not directly in their presence, its even better. However, if you're in the presence of other average folk who would learn from him, then on could say, that it would be better to do it in their presence, so that they should learn from him how do as he has done. However, he should direct his heart [intention] to the Name of the Heaven, but not boastfully God forbid. ", 
            "AND WHEN HE IS ALONE - It means to say, even when he is in the privacy of his home, also he should be walking with the Lord his God, as [the Re'ma] concludes...", 
            "WITH ALACRITY - Not exactly, bur rather he should wait a bit and not get up immediately, because it is damaging for the body. It is good to say immediately upon rising \"I am gratefully to you my eternal king who has returned my soul in kindess; great is your faith.\" It should be said with a pause after \"kindness\""

            "The essence of the mitzvah of delight in Shabbat is explained to us by the prophets, as it says: “and you shall call the Sabbath a delight,” and there are authorities who believe that the essence is from the Torah, for Shabbat is part of the times that are called holy... as is explained in the Sifra... And our rabbis spoke highly of the importance of this mitzvah (in Shabbat 118)... And similarly in every location, one should delight in Shabbat according to the custom, with food and drink that is considered delight for them. And since in general, most people get their delight from meat and wine and sweets, therefore we learn...that one should have a lot of meat and wine and sweets according to one’s abilities."

Be very careful to not bathe for the mitzvah and have the concern of violating Shabbos. And with many sins, many fail in this in the winter days and short days that if wait a short amount, it will get dark. And even if you complete your washing permissibly, also be careful of a prohibition because at times you will comb your hair afterwards, which is a Torah violation of Shabbos. Also another thing that's found is to squeeze out the towel from the water that it was holding. This is the prohibition of M'chabeis (laundering). It is proper for all who fear god with their hearts, to warn the nation not to do this. And their is a principle that if the nation does a sin you could've stopped, you also recieve punishment. However, if you stop the nation from doing this, you are also rewarded. If you don't stop the people in your house, you get the sin of the people in your house. If you don't stop the people in your city, you get the sin of your city.",

For not only do they not listen, but they mix it up so that the adults also cannot listen, and the only reason they come is to beat Haman.  In this way the father does not fulfill the commandment of education at all.  In truth, from the perspective of the commandment of education, every father has to keep his young children near him, and to supervise them that they listen to the reading, and when the reader gets to mentioning the name of Haman the Aggagite, the child is permitted to hit as is his custom, but not that that should be the primary purpose of bringing the child to the study hall.",

And it is appropriate for every Jew to behave this way if he can.  And see infra, 690:4."
