            "It is a positive commandment to refrain from working the land and caring for trees in the seventh year, as it says, \"and the land shall rest a Sabbath for the Lord\" (Leviticus 25:2), and it says \"in plowing and in harvesting you shall rest\" (Exodus 34:21).  Anyone who performs one of the forbidden labors from the working of the land or caring for trees in this year has abrogated a positive commandment and transgressed a negative commandment, as it says, \"you shall not plant your field, nor shall you prune your vineyard\" (Leviticus 25:4)."

            "Working of the land in the sixth year (of the Sabbatical cycle) is forbidden 30 days in advance of the seventh year, as an oral law given to Moses at Sinai, because he prepares it (for planting) in the Sabbatical year.  By tradition, this labor is forbidden when the Temple is in existence, but the Rabbis legislated additional restriction, that people should not plow orchards in the eve of Sabbatical year during Temple times except until Shavuot, and grain fields only until Passover. When there is no Temple, it is permitted to work the land until New Year as in the law of the [written] Torah.", 
            "What defines an orchard? Three trees in a beit seah (plot of land 50 x 50 cubits), whether a non-fruit-bearing tree or a fruit bearing tree.  Even if they belong to three different people, we view them as if they are fig trees.  If they (fig trees of similar size or maturity) would be capable of producing a dried fig cake weighing sixty talents, it is permitted to plow the entire beit seah for them (the trees), as long as the distance between each tree is sufficient for the ox with its utensils (yoke) to pass [between the trees].",
