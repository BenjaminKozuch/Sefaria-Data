It is forbidden to reprimand a poor person, or to raise your voice and yell at him, because his heart would break and he would become depressed. And it says: \"A broken and contrite heart, O God, You will not despise\" (Psalms 51:19). And it says: \"To revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones\" (Isaiah 57:15). And woe is he who humiliates a poor person, woe is him. Rather, be like a father [to the poor], whether through grace or words, as it says: \"I am a father to the destitute\" (Job 29:16). "
