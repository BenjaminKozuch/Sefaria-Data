            "The Reading of the Megillah in its (proper) time is a positive commandment of the Scribes. And it is known that it is an enactment of the Prophets. All are obligated in its reading: men, women, converts, and freed slaves. And we educate minors in its reading. Even Priests engaged in service [of the Temple] cease their service and come to hear the reading of the Megillah, and similarly do we cease Torah study to hear the reading of the Megillah. How much more so, then, are all other commandments of the Torah superseded by the reading of the Megillah. There is nothing that the reading of the Megillah does not supersede, except the burial of a deceased person who has no one to bury him; one who encounters his [corpse] buries it first, then reads [Megillah].", 
            "Both the reader and the person who hears the reader have fulfilled their obligation. And this is so if he heard it from someone who was obligated to read it. Therefore, if the reader was a minor or a fool, the person who heard it has not fulfilled his obligation.", 
            "The commandment is to read it entirely, and the commandments is to read it at night and in the day. One may read the nightly reading the entire night, and one may read the day reading the entire day. The one who blesses before the nightly reading makes three blessings, and these are they: \"Blessed are you God our God, king of the world, who sanctified us with His commandments, and commanded us upon the reading of the Megillah.\" \"Blessed are you God our God, king of the world, who performed miracles for our ancestors in those days and this time.\" \"Blessed are you God our God, king of the world, who renews us and preserves us and lets us reach this time.\" And during the day, one does not repeat and make the \"Renew us\" blessing. And places that have the custom to bless after [the reading], bless, \"Blessed are you God our God, king of the world, the God who fights our fights, and judges our judgement, and avenges our vengeances, who retaliates for our suffering, who pays back on all the enemies of our souls. Blessed are you God who retaliates for Israel from all their suffering, the God who saves.\"", 
            "Which is the time of its reading? The Sages instituted many times, as it says, \"in their times.\" And these are the times of its reading: Any province that was surrounded by a wall from the times of Joshua bin Nun, whether in the land [of Israel] or outside the land [of Israel]. even if it has no wall now, reads on the 15th of Adar. And this province is called a \"k'rach\" - \"large city\". And any province that was not surrounded by a wall from the times of Joshua, even if it has a wall now, reads on the 14th. And this province is called an \"ir\" - \"small city.\" ", 
            "The province of Shushan, though it was not surrounded by a wall at the time of Joshua son of Nun reads it on the 15th, because the miracle occurred there, as it says, \"And on the 15th they rested\" (Esther 9:18). And why was the issue made dependent on the time of Joshua? In order to honor the Land of Israel, which was in ruins at that time. So they read it like the people of Shushan do, and consider themselves to be surrounded by a wall, even though they are now in ruins, since they were walled cities in the time of Joshua they read it on the 15th, and it would be a reminder of the Land of Israel in this miracle.\n"

Instead he must read it from its beginning to the end in the proper order. If he read and paused briefly and went back to read it, even if he paused long enough to finish all of it, since he read it in the proper order, he has fulfilled his obligation.",

It will continue to be binding like the Five Books of Moses and the entire Oral Law which will never be invalidated. Even though all memory of our suffering will be erased…still the days of Purim will not be annulled."
