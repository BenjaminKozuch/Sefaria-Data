            "Resting from labor on the seventh day is a positive commandment, as it says \"On the seventh day you must rest.\" One who does labor on it has not fulfilled a positive commandment and also has transgressed a negative commandment, as it says \"Do not do any manner of labor.\"  What is his liability for doing labor?  If he did it with intent and malice, he is liable for spiritual excommunication.  If there were witnesses and warning given, he is (additionally) stoned.  However, if it was accidental, he is liable to bring a Chatat offering."

            "The Sabbath is pushed off when it comes to danger to life, like the rest of the commandments..  Therefore, they do all the needs of a sick person who is in [lifethreatening] danger on the Sabbath, according to the instructions of the professional doctor of that place.  If there is a doubt whether he needs to have Sabbath desecrated for him or not, and so if one doctor said to desecrate the Sabbath and one say he does not need it, they desecrate the Sabbath for him, because a doubt regarding lives pushes off the Sabbath.", 
            "If he is assessed on shabbat and he needs to [receive treatment] and continue [his treatment] for eight days, don't say, \"We will wait until night in order to not desecrate two Sabbaths.\" Rather, start from today which is the Sabbath and desecrate it, even one hundred times, as many times as necessary-- when he is in danger or there is a doubt of danger, we desecrate [the Sabbath]. We can light a candle for him, and extinguish a candle that is before him, and slaughter [food] and bake and cook, and warm up warm water in order to drink or bathe his body. The general rule of Sabbath regarding a dangerously ill person: [the Sabbath should be treated] like a weekday for anything that is necessary.", 
            "When you do these things [for a sick person], do not do them through the hands of non-Jews, children, slaves or women, so that the Sabbath should not be taken lightly in your eyes. Rather, [they should be done] through the hands of the greatest of Jews and scholars. It is forbidden to delay desecrating the Sabbath for a person who is dangerously ill, as it is said [Leviticus 18:5]: \"and Mine ordinances, which if a man do, he shall live by them,\" i.e. and not die by [My ordinances]. Learn that the laws of the Torah only exist in the world for mercy, loving kindness, and peace in the world. It is the heretics who say that this is desecration of shabbat and it is forbidden. It is on them that [Ezekiel 20:25] writes: \"Wherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good, and ordinances whereby they should not live.\"", 
            "Someone whose eyes are worrisome and both [eyes] or one has secretions or tears flowing out of pain, or blood flowing from them, or if they are in piercing pain, or other such illnesses-- this all falls within the category of a dangerously ill person, and we desecrate the Sabbath for him and do anything necessary for his healing.", 
            "And so too if he is injured in his body cavity-- from his lips and inward, whether in his mouth or his digestive tract or his liver and spleen, or in other in any other places in his cavity-- this is a dangerously ill person and there is no need to assess if his illness is heavy enough. Therefore, we desecrate the Sabbath for him immediately without assessing [its severity]. An injury on the back of the hand or back of the foot is like an injury of the body cavity and there is no need to assess [its severity], and we desecrate the Sabbath for it. A fever that prickles the skin [causes shivering?] is similar an injury to his body cavity and we desecrate the Sabbath for him. And so to for all illnesses that the doctors say is dangerous, even if it is only outside on the skin, we desecrate the Sabbath by their word.", 
            "If someone swallows a leech, we can warm water for him on shabbat and do anything necessary for his healing since he is in mortal danger. And so to someone who is bitten by a rabid dog or by any animal that crawls in the dirt that [is poisonous and] can kill you, even if there is a doubt whether it is poisonous or not, we do anything medically necessary to save him.", 
            "A sick person whose doctors assessed that a fig needed to be brought to him, and ten people ran and brought him ten figs at once, they are all completely absolved [of punishment]. [This applies] even if they brought them one after another, and even if he got better after the first [fig], since they all brought them with permission.", 
            "If a sick person needed two figs, and they only found two figs on two separate branches and three figs on  one branch, we cut the branch that has three even though we only need two in order to not increase the amount of harvesting. Rather, we only cut one and do not cut two; and so too with other similar situations.", 
            "If someone cooks for a sick person on the Sabbath, and the sick person eats, and there are leftovers, it is prohibited for the healthy person to the leftovers because of a decree lest he increase for himself the amount he cooks. But if someone slaughters for a sick person on the Sabbath, it is permitted for the healthy person to eat the raw meat from it since there is no additional action upon which a decree could be made \"lest he increase for himself.\" And so on.", 
            "A sick person who is not in danger, you can do anything he needs through a non-Jew. How is this done? Tell the non-Jew to do for him and he can do it, to cook or to bake or to carry medicine from one domain to another, and so on. And so to he can powder his eyes [for comfort] through the non-Jew on the Sabbath, even though there is no danger. And if there are any non-work actions that need to be done, even a Jew can do them. Therefore we can raise his ears on the Sabbath and raise the cartilage [of his heart], and we can reduce a fracture, and anything along these lines is permitted.", 
            "A pregnant woman who is squatting to give birth is in mortal danger and we violate the Sabbath for her. We call a midwife for her from one place to another and we cut and tie the umbilical cord, and if she needs a candle at the time of her labor pains we can light a candle. And [this is true] even if she is blind, since her mind will be calmed by the candle even if she can't see. And if she needs oil or anything else, we can bring it for her. And anything that can be changed [about the Sabbath violation being performed] should be changed when being done. For example, her friend should bring her utensil tied to her hair; but if she can't, she should bring it as normal.", 
            "...We don't birth an idolatress on the Sabbath, even for a fee, and we don't worry about creating bad relations [between the Jews and non-Jews], even if there is no violation [of the Sabbath]. But we birth a non-Jew in your midst [i.e. a non-Jew who does not worship idols], since we are commanded to sustain them, and we don't violate the Sabbath for her."

            "The kindling of a lamp on Shabbat is not optional that if one wants, one kindles and if one does not want, one does not kindle. And it is not a commandment that we are not obligated to pursue until one has done it, for example an eruv for courtyards or lifting (i.e. washing) the hands before eating; rather, it is an obligation. And both men and women are equally obligated that a lamp be kindled in their houses on Shabbat. Even if one does not have anything he will [be able to] eat, he begs at the doors [of neighbors] and takes oil and kindles the lamp since this is [included] in the rule of enjoyment on Shabbat. And one is obligated to bless before the kindling: \"Blessed are You LORD our God, King of the universe who makes us holy with His commandments and commands us to kindle a Shabbat lamp\" in the way that one blesses over all things which one is obligated [to do] by the words of the Sages.", 
            "It is permitted to use a Shabbat lamp. And this is [in the case] that the thing [one is doing] does not need much devotion. But if it is a thing that needs to be precise with regard to seeing, it is forbidden to use the light of the lamp for distinguishing - it is a decree lest one tilt [the lamp].", 
            "The one who kindles need to kindle while it is still day, before the sunset. And women are commanded regarding this matter more than men since they are found in the house, and they busy themselves with the labor of the house. And even so, a man needs to take care and check them on this and say to the members of the household on the eve of Shabbat before it gets dark, \"Kindle the lamp!\" If it is doubtful [whether] darkness has fallen and [whether] Shabbat has entered or [whether it has] not, one does not kindle."

And this matter is forbidden according to the words of the Rabbis so that Shabbat will not be light in their eyes and they will come to do [labor] themselves."

Therefore they decreed that a person may not enter the bathhouse on Shabbat even sweat. And they decreed that one may not wash all of one's body in hot water, not even in hot water that was heated on the [prior to] Shabbat; but one's face and one's hands, and one's feet are permitted. Regarding what case are we talking? About hot water heated by fire- a decree because of the bathhouse. But the hot waters of Tiberias, and similar, in it, it is permitted to wash one's whole body in them. And it is forbidden to wash in hot water that is in caves, because the caverns have steam, and one will come to sweat, and do it was considered to be like a bathhouse."

If one is unable to afford (these expenditures), even if one only makes fried vegetables or something similar in honor of the Shabbat, this is considered fulfillment of  enjoyment of the Shabbat.
