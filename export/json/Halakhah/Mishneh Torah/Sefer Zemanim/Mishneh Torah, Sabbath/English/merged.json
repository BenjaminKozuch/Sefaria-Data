            "The Sabbath is pushed off when it comes to danger to life, like the rest of the commandments..  Therefore, they do all the needs of a sick person who is in [lifethreatening] danger on the Sabbath, according to the instructions of the professional doctor of that place.  If there is a doubt whether he needs to have Sabbath desecrated for him or not, and so if one doctor said to desecrate the Sabbath and one say he does not need it, they desecrate the Sabbath for him, because a doubt regarding lives pushes off the Sabbath."

            "The kindling of a lamp on Shabbat is not optional that if one wants, one kindles and if one does not want, one does not kindle. And it is not a commandment that we are not obligated to pursue until one has done it, for example an eruv for courtyards or lifting (i.e. washing) the hands before eating; rather, it is an obligation. And both men and women are equally obligated that a lamp be kindled in their houses on Shabbat. Even if one does not have anything he will [be able to] eat, he begs at the doors [of neighbors] and takes oil and kindles the lamp since this is [included] in the rule of enjoyment on Shabbat. And one is obligated to bless before the kindling: \"Blessed are You LORD our God, King of the universe who makes us holy with His commandments and commands us to kindle a Shabbat lamp\" in the way that one blesses over all things which one is obligated [to do] by the words of the Sages.", 
            "It is permitted to use a Shabbat lamp. And this is [in the case] that the thing [one is doing] does not need much devotion. But if it is a thing that needs to be precise with regard to seeing, it is forbidden to use the light of the lamp for distinguishing - it is a decree lest one tilt [the lamp].", 
            "The one who kindles need to kindle while it is still day, before the sunset. And women are commanded regarding this matter more than men since they are found in the house, and they busy themselves with the labor of the house. And even so, a man needs to take care and check them on this and say to the members of the household on the eve of Shabbat before it gets dark, \"Kindle the lamp!\" If it is doubtful [whether] darkness has fallen and [whether] Shabbat has entered or [whether it has] not, one does not kindle."

And this matter is forbidden according to the words of the Rabbis so that Shabbat will not be light in their eyes and they will come to do [labor] themselves."

            "[Regarding the Sabbath,] the Torah [Exodus 23:12] states: \"[On the seventh day,] you shall cease activity.\" [This implies] ceasing [even the performance of certain] activities that are not [included in the categories of the forbidden] labors.1  [The Torah left the definition of the scope of this commandment to] the Sages, [who] forbade many activities as sh'vut. Some activities are forbidden because they resemble the forbidden labors, while other activities are forbidden lest they lead one to commit a forbidden labor.

And we may not hang on an animal, and we do not go up [on an animal] while it is still daytime [before Shabbat] so that we may sit on it during Shabbat, and we do not lean on the side of animal, but [leaning on] the side of [something leaning on] the side is permitted. One who went up a tree on Shabbat unintentionally, it is permitted to come down, but intentionally, it is forbidden to come down. And on an animal, even intentionally, one comes down because of  [the prohibition of causing] pain to living creatures. An so, one unloads a burden from on top of an animal on Shabbat because of [the prohibition of causing] pain to living creatures."

            "Why did the Sages forbid entering a bathhouse on Shabbat? Because of the attendants who would heat hot water on Shabbat and say it had been heated before Shabbat. Therefore they decreed that a person may not enter the bathhouse on Shabbat even sweat. And they decreed that one may not wash all of one's body in hot water, not even in hot water that was heated on the [prior to] Shabbat; but one's face and one's hands, and one's feet are permitted. Regarding what case are we talking? About hot water heated by fire- a decree because of the bathhouse. But the hot waters of Tiberias, and similar, in it, it is permitted to wash one's whole body in them. And it is forbidden to wash in hot water that is in caves, because the caverns have steam, and one will come to sweat, and do it was considered to be like a bathhouse."
