            "... It is a negative commandment that one should not protect the life of a rodef (pursuer). For this reason, the sages ruled that in the case of a pregnant woman in a dangerous labor, it is permissible to dismember the fetus in her womb - whether with a drug or by hand because it is like a rodef pursuing her to kill her. However, once his head has emerged one may not touch him, as we do not set aside one nefesh [soul] for another, and this is the natural way of the world."

            "How [or in what circumstance]? The one who throws a stone into the public domain and it kills [someone] or the one who is taking down his wall into the public domain and a stone fell and it killed [someone]. Either when he took it down during the day or when he took it down at night, behold, he is [considered] grossly negligent and is not exiled [to the city of refuge] because it is a crime, because he should have looked and [only then] afterwards he can throw [the stone] or take down the wall.",

If many people are not common there at all, behold, it is [considered to be] a freak accident and he is exempt from exile.",

            "And this [is also the case when], the one who throws a stone and after it left his hand, that person put out his head and he received [the stone to his face and he died, the thrower] is exempt from exile, as it is said, \"and it found his friend” (Deuteronomy 19:5) excludes the one who places himself [in danger].\n"
