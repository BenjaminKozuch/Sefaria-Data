            "All who are obligated to appear are obligated to bring a festival offering and all who are exempt from appearing are exempt from the festival offering and all are obligated for the offering of celebration except for the deaf-mute, the mentally incompetent, the minor, the uncircumcised, and the ritually impure.  The deaf-mute, mentally incompetent, and the minor because they are never held to be obligated and so they are exempt from all commandments explicitly stated in the Torah.  The uncircumcised and the impure because  they cannot eat sanctified food and cannot appear and enter [the Temple]  like we have explained in the Laws of Entry into the Sanctuary and the Laws of Sacrificial Acts.

            "And converts who do not recognize that they are obligated to direct their hearts and to attune their ears to hear with fear and reverence and joy  trembling like the day on which [Torah] was given at Sinai.  Even great sages that know the Torah completely are obligated to listen with exceptionally great concentration.  And one who is unable to listen should direct his heart to the reading, that Scripture is established to strengthen true faith.  And he should see himself as if now he is commanded and from God he heard it, that the king is an agent to cause the words of God to be heard."
