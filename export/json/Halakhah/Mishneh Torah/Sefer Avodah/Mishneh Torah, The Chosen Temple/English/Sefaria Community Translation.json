            "It is a positive obligation to build a house for God where offerings may be brought and to make pilgrimage to it three times a year as it says \"and they shall make Me a sanctuary.\" The tabernacle which Moses made in the desert has already been described in the Torah, but it was a temporary measure, as it says \"for you have not yet reached, etc.\"", 
            "Once [the Israelites] entered the Land, they set up the tabernacle at Gilgal [where it remained fourteen years while] they conquered and divided the land. From there it went to Shiloh, where they built a stone building without a ceiling and spread the sheets from the [original] tabernacle over it. It stayed in Shiloh for 369 years until Eli [the High Priest] died and it was destroyed and moved to Nob. When Samuel died, it moved to Gibeon, and from there it came to the Eternal House. The period of Nob and Gibeon [together] was 57 years.", 
            "Once the Temple was built in Jerusalem, all other places became ineligible for building Houses of God or to offer sacrifices there, and for all generations there is no Temple other than the one in Jerusalem and only on Mt. Moriah about which David said \"This is the house of the LORD God, and this is the altar for the offerings of Israel\" and it says \"This is My resting place forever.\"", 
            "The building which Solomon built has already been described in I Kings. Similarly, the Temple which will be built in the future which is mentioned in Ezekiel, is not described clearly or completely. The people of the Second commonwealth built their Temple like Solomon's with some of the features described explicitly in Ezekiel.", 
            "The following are the major requirements for the Temple: It must have a sanctuary and an inner sanctum. There must be a space in front of the sanctuary called the Hall (אולם) and the three together are called \"Heichal\" (היכל). Another wall must be built around the Heichal away from the building itself, like the curtains around the courtyard of the tabernacle in the desert. Everything enclosed by this wall representing the yard of the tabernacle is called the Court (עזרה) and the whole compound is called \"Temple\" (מקדש)", 
            "Vessels must be made for the Temple: An altar for burnt offerings and other sacrifices, and a ramp to access the altar; these are placed in front of the Hall slightly southward (of center). The basin and its base, which the priests use to wash their hands and feet for the service, are both placed between the altar and the Hall towards the south, on your left as you enter the sanctuary. A table, a (smaller) altar for incense, and a Menorah [are also necessary] and all three go in the sanctuary in front of the inner sanctum.", 
            "The Menorah belongs on the south side, on your left as you enter, and the table --which holds the show-bread -- on the right. Both of them are just outside the inner sanctum. The incense altar goes between them, but further out from the inner sanctum. The court is divided into sections for priests and Israelites, and rooms are built there for the various needs of the Temple. Each room is called an office (לשכה)", 
            "The Temple is to be built with large stones or bricks if large stones are not available. The stones are not carved on site, rather they are carved and dressed away from the Temple Mount and brought in afterwards, as it says \"Large, expensive stones for the foundation of the House, hewn stones\" and it [also] says \"the sound of the axe, nor any other metal tool was heard in the Temple while it was being built.\"", 
            "There is to be no visible wood structure in any part of the Temple compound, only stones or bricks and mortar. Even [temporary] wooden walkways in the Court are not allowed.", 
            "The floor of the Court is paved with expensive stones. If one of the stones was detached, even if it is still in place it is invalid [as part of the Temple] and a Priest cannot perform Temple services while standing on it until it is reattached.", 
            "The appropriate way to perform the Mitzvah is to [continuously] strengthen and expand the building as much as the community can afford as it says \"and to glorify the house of our God.\" It is also a mitzvah to renovate, and beautify the building. If [the community] can plate the whole thing in gold and to make [the architecture] famous, that too is a mitzvah.", 
            "The Temple is not to be built at night as it says \"and on the <i>day</i> the Tabernacle was erected,\" i.e. we erect it during the day but not at night. We may work on the construction from dawn until the stars come out, and everyone is obligated to build helping physically and financially both men and women just like the sanctuary in the desert. However, we do not close the schools in order [for the children] to build the Temple nor does building the Temple override Shabbat or the festivals.", 
            "The altar is made out of stones only. When the Torah says \"build Me an altar of earth\" it means that the altar should be part of the earth and not built over domes or arches. When it says \"and <i>if</i> you make Me a stone altar\" the oral tradition teaches that it is not permission but an obligation.", 
            "Any stone that was chipped enough to catch the fingernail [to the same exacting standards] as with a shechita knife, in unfit for the ramp and for the altar as it says \"With whole stones build the altar of God.\" Where did they get the stones? From virgin ground. They would dig down to where it was obvious that this soil is not for cultivating or building and take out whole stones, or they would take rocks from the Mediterranean Sea and build with those. Similarly, the stones of the Temple and the Courtyards were also whole. ", 
            "Stones of the Sanctuary or the courtyard which were chipped or scraped cannot be repaired, rather they must be hid away. Any stone which was touched by iron may not be used for the Altar or the ramp because it says \"for you have lifted your sword against it and desecrated it.\" One who built the ramp or the altar with stones touched by iron is flogged because it says (as a prohibition) \"do not build them of hewn stones\" but if one built with a chipped stone he has (only) transgressed a positive commandment.", 
            "A stone which was chipped or touched by iron after it was built into the altar or the ramp is invalid, but the rest [remain] valid. The alter was whitewashed twice a year at Passover and Sukkot and when they whitewashed it they used a cloth rather than a trowel to prevent iron from touching the stones.", 
            "It is forbidden to make steps up to the altar as it says \"thou shalt not go up on steps to My altar\" rather we build a sort of mound at the southern end of the altar which gets shorter and shorter until it reaches the ground and this is called a 'ramp.' One who ascends the altar on stairs is flogged, as is one who removes a stone from the altar, or from the entire Temple building or from the [area of courtyard] between the Temple and the altar as a destructive measure as it says \"thou shalt break up their altars etc.\" and it says \"thou shalt not do so to the LORD thy God.\"", 
            "The Menorah, its vessels, the Table, its vessels, the Incense-Altar, and all  vessels of the Divine Service may only be made out of metal; they are invalid if made out of wood, bone, stone or glass.", 
            "If the Community is poor they may even make [the vessels] out of lead. If they are rich, they [should] make them out of gold, even the pitchforks, skewers, and shovels of the Sacrificial Altar [which tend to get dirty]. [The community] should even plate the gates of the courtyard with gold if they can afford it.", 
            "The vessels must be originally made with the intent [to use them] for the Divine Service. If they were already made for mundane purposes they may not be used for sacred ones. Things that were made for sacred purposes but were not yet used may be used for mundane purposes but once they were used for a sacred purpose they become forbidden for the mundane. Stones and boards which were originally cut for a synagogue may not be built with on the Temple Mount."

            "The altar is placed extremely precisely and may never ever be placed anywhere else as it says \"This is the Altar for the offerings of Israel.\" And it was in the temple that Isaac was bound as it says \"and go to the land of Moriah\" and it says \"Solomon built the temple on Mt. Moriah.\"", 
            "And it is a tradition accepted by all, that the place where David and Solomon built the altar at the threshing floor of Arauna was the place that Abraham built the altar and bound Isaac upon it, and that was the place that Noah built upon when he left the ark, and that was the altar upon which Kain and Abel sacrificed, and upon which Adam the First sacrificed when he was created. And from there was born the saying of the sages that \"Man was created from the place of his atonement.\"", 
            "The measurements of the Altar are very exact and its shape is known [by tradition] from man to man. The altar that those who ascended from the [Babylonian] exile built was made like the one which will be built in the future. It is forbidden to add or subtract from its dimensions.", 
            "Of the three prophets who ascended with them from the exile, one testified as to the Altar's location, one to its dimensions, and one to the Law that the could bring offerings on the altar even though the there was no Temple [yet].", 
            "The Altar that Moses made, that Solomon made, that the returnees of the [First] Exile made, and that will be made in the future are all 10 cubits high, and that which is stated in the Torah: \"and three cubits its height, that is the place of the pyre alone (above the ledge of the Altar). And the dimensions of the Altar that the returnees of the Exile made and the one that will be built in the future are 32 cubits by 32 cubits.", 
            "The ten cubits of the height of the Altar, some of them are of a 5-handbreadth cubit and some are of a 6-handbreadth cubit, and the rest of the cubits of the building are of 6 handbreadths. The height of the entire Altar is 58 handbreadths. ", 
            "These are its dimensions and its shape: [Starting from the 32x32 cubit square at ground level] it goes up five hand-breadths and in five hand-breadths, [making] the base. Now it is 30 cubits and two hand-breadths. It goes up thirty hand-breadths and in five hand-breadths, making the ledge. [From there,] it went up another eighteen hand-breadths and this was the place of the pyre. Its width [on each side at the top] works out to [a square of] 28 cubits and four hand-breadths by 28 cubits and four hand-breadths. [From the top], it went up [another] eighteen hand-breadths built as a hollow structure at each corner. The place for the \"horns\" was one cubit by one cubit, and the path for the priests was one cubit by one cubit, so the [dimensions of the] place of the pyre works out to 24 cubits and four handbreadths by 24 cubits and four hand-breadths."

            "The Menorah's shape is described explicitly in the Torah, and there were four cups, two knobs, and two flowers on the stem as it says \"and on the Menorah there were four cups, decorated with its knobs and its flowers.\" There was a third flower near the leg as it says \"from its leg to its flower.\"", 
            "It also had three legs and three more knobs on the stem where the six branches came out, three on each side. There were three cups, a flower, and a knob on each branch and all of them were made like almonds.", 
            "The [sums] work out to twenty-two cups, nine flowers, and eleven knobs, all of which are absolutely necessary. If even one of the forty-two [decorations] are missing, it prevents all of them [from being valid.]", 
            "When is the above law [that all the decorations are essential] true? When it is made of gold. However, [if it were made of] other metals, we do not make the cups, knobs, and flowers. Similarly, a golden Menorah must be one talent of gold, including the candles, and hammered out solid while [in the case of Menorahs made of] other metals we do not care about the weight, and it is Kosher even if it is hollow.", 
            "It is never made out of scraps whether [scraps of] gold or of other metals.", 
            "The tongs, the pans, and the oil vessels are not part of the talent [of gold] as it says [in the commandment to make a Menorah] \"pure gold,\" then repeats itself and says \"the tongs and the pans of pure gold.\" It does not say \"pure gold lamps\" because the lamps are part of the Menorah and [therefore] part of the talent."
