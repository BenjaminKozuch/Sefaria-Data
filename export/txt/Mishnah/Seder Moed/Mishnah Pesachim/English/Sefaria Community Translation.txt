Chapter 1


On the evening of the fourteenth [of Nissan] we check for leavened bread by candlelight. Any place which we do not bring leavened bread into does not require checking. And why did [the sages] say [that we must check up to] two rows in the wine cellar? [It is] a place which we bring leavened bread into. The House of Shammai say: Two rows upon the entire wine-cellar. The House of Hillel say: The two outer rows, which are the uppermost.

Chapter 2

The entire time that one is allowed to eat [<i>chamets</i> - unleavened grain products], one may feed it to a domesticated animal, to a wild animal, to birds, and to sell it to a gentile, and it is permitted to benefit from it.  [After the] time [that it may still be eaten] has passed, it is prohibited to benefit from it, and one may not fire an oven or a pot range with it.  Rabbi Yehuda says, "The destruction of <i>chamets</i> may not be done except by burning.  But the Sages say, "One may also crumble [it] and throw [it] into the wind or put [it] in the sea."
If there were <i>chamets</i> of a gentile, which [was in existence] during Pesach, it is permitted to benefit from it  [after Pesach]; but [if it were] of an Israelite, it is forbidden to benefit from it  [after Pesach], as it is said (Shemot 13:7), "And there shall not be seen any leaven to you."
If a gentile lent money to an Israelite upon [the security] of [the latter's] <i>chamets</i> [and he defaults on the loan],  after Pesach it is permitted to benefit from it; but when an Israelite has lent money to a gentile upon [the security] of [the latter's] <i>chamets</i> [and he defaults on the loan],  after Pesach it is forbidden to benefit from it; If <i>chamets</i> has been covered by fallen ruins, behold it is as if it is destroyed; Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says, "Only when [it is so much covered that] a dog cannot search for it."
One who eats <i>terumah</i> [a portion of a crop given to a Kohen which becomes holy upon separation, and can only be consumed by Kohanim or their household] that is <i>chamets</i> on Pesach, [if it be] through error, he must pay the principal, and the fifth part [in addition]; but if [he did it] willfully, he is exempt from  payments, and [even of paying] for the value of the wood [if the <i> chamets</i> were to have been used for fuel in the place of wood].
These are the [grains] with which a person may discharge his [obligation to eat matza] on Pesach:  with wheat, with barley, with spelt, and with rye, and with oats. We may discharge [our obligation] with <i>demai</i>‎ [produce from which it is uncertain whether tithes were already taken], and with <i>ma'aser rishon</i> [the first tithe of produce, which must be given to the Levi] from which <i>terumah</i> [a portion of a crop given to a Kohen which becomes holy upon separation, and can only be consumed by Kohanim or their household] has been taken; and with <i>ma'aser sheni</i> [the second tithe of produce, which must be taken to Jerusalem and consumed there] and <i>hekdesh</i> [property, living or inanimate, devoted by its owner for sacred purposes, by which action he ceases to be its owner] which have been redeemed; and for <i>Kohanim</i> [members of the priestly caste, a subgroup of tribe of Levi, which is uniquely responsible for maintaining and carrying out the sacrificial services in the Temple] with <i>challah</i> [a portion of a batch of bread dough given to a <i>Kohen</i> which becomes holy upon separation, and can only be consumed by <i>Kohanim</i> or their household], and with <i>terumah</i>. But [we may] not [discharge our obligation] with <i>tevel</i> [produce from which the various tithes have not yet been separated]; and not with <i>ma'aser rishon</i>, from which <i>terumah</i> has not been taken; or with <i>ma'aser sheni</i> and <i>hekdesh</i> which have not been redeemed.; and not with the loaves of a thank-offering, and the thin cakes of the offering of a <i>nazir</i> [a person who vows to avoid corpse impurity, refrain from cutting his hair and abstain from all grape products] if one had made them for his own use; if [however] he had made them to sell in the market, we may discharge [our obligation] with them.
These are the vegetables with which a person discharges his [obligation to eat bitter herbs] on Pesach: with lettuce, and with wild endive, and with garden endive, and with ‏<i>charchavina</i>‎ [a specific type of green], and with bitter coriander; we may discharge [our obligation] with them whether they are fresh or dried, but not [if they are] pickled, boiled, or cooked. [These different vegetables] may combine [together] to [make up the required size of] a <i>kazayit</i> [a specific measure of volume]; and we may discharge [our obligation] with their stalks; and with <i>demai</i>‎, and with <i>ma'aser rishon</i> from which <i>terumah</i>  has been taken; and with <i>ma'aser sheni</i> and <i>hekdesh</i> which have been redeemed.
We may not soak bran for chickens [on Pesach]; but we may scald it. A woman may not soak the bran which she takes with her to the bathhouse, but must may use rub it on her body [when it is] dry. One may not chew [grains of] wheat and place them [as a salve] on his wound, because they will become leavened.
We may not put flour into <i>charoset</i> [a sweet mixture of fruits and spices eaten with the bitter herbs] or into mustard; if one did [so], he should eat [it] immediately. But Rabbi Meir forbids [it]. We may not boil the Pesach sacrifice, not with drinks and not with fruit juices; but we may dab it or dip it [after it has been roasted] in them. Water which a baker uses [in making the dough] must be thrown away [immediately], because it becomes leavened.

Chapter 10

On the eve of Passover [from] close to [the time of] the afternoon offering, no one must eat until nightfall.  Even the poorest person in Israel must not eat [on the night of Passover] unless he reclines.  And they must give him no fewer than four cups of wine, even [if he receives relief] from the charity plate.
They pour the first cup [of wine] for [the leader of the seder].  The House of Shammai say: He recites a blessing for the day [first], and then recites a blessing over the wine  But the House of Hillel say: He recites a blessing over the wine [first], and then recites a blessing for the day.
[Then] they set [food] before him.  He dips the lettuce before he reaches the course following the [unleavened] bread.  [Then] they set before him unleavened bread, lettuce, and a mixture of apples, nuts, and wine, and two dishes, although the mixture of apples, nuts, and wine is not compulsory.  Rabbi Eliezer bar Tzadok says: It is compulsory.  And in the Temple they used to bring before him the body of the Passover-offering.
They pour a second cup [of wine] for him.  And here the son questions his father.  And if the son has insufficient understanding [to question], his father teaches him [to ask]:  Why is this night different from all [other] nights?  On all [other] nights, we eat leavened and unleavened bread, [but] on this night, [we eat] only unleavened bread.  On all [other] nights, we eat all kinds of vegetables, [but] on this night, [we eat only] bitter herbs.  On all [other] nights, we eat meat roasted, stewed or boiled, [but] on this night, [we eat] only roasted [meat].  On all [other] nights, we dip [vegetables] once, [but] on this night, we dip [vegetables] twice.  And according to the son's intelligence, his father instructs him.  He begins [answering the questions] with [the account of Israel’s] shame and concludes with [Israel’s] glory, and expounds from “My father was a wandering Aramean” until he completes the whole passage.
Rabban Gamliel used to say: Whoever does not mentioned these three things on Passover does not discharge his duty, and these are they: the Passover-offering, unleavened bread, and bitter herbs. [The] Passover-offering [is offered] because the Omnipresent One passed over the houses of our ancestors in Egypt. Unleavened bread [is eaten] because our ancestors were redeemed from Egypt. [The] bitter herb is [eaten] because the Egyptians embittered the lives of our ancestors in Egypt.  In every generation a person must regard himself as though he personally had gone out of Egypt, as it is said: “And you shall tell your son in that day, saying: ‘It is because of what the Lord did for me when I came forth out of Egypt.’” Therefore it is our duty to thank, praise, laud, glorify, exalt, honor, bless, extol, and adore Him Who performed all these miracles for our ancestors and us; He brought us forth from bondage into freedom, from sorrow into joy, from mourning into festivity, from darkness into great light, and from servitude into redemption. Therefore let us say before Him, Hallelujah!
Up until which point should he recite?  The House of Shammai says: Up to 'as a happy mother of children'.  The House of Hillel says: Up to 'flint stone into a water-spring', and conclude with the blessing of redemption.  Rabbi Tarfon says: 'who redeemed us and our ancestors from Egypt', but without a concluding blessing.  Rabbi Akiva says: 'O YHVH our God and God of our ancestors--may we come to reach other seasons and festivals in peace, joyful in the rebuilding of your city, and jubilant in your Temple service, where we will eat from the offerings and Passover sacrifices etc.' until 'Bless you YHVH, Redeemer of Israel.
They mix a third cup; he blesses his meal. [The] fourth [cup] is concluded with Hallel, which he says with the [concluding] blessing.  Between these cups, if he wishes to drink, he may drink.  Between the third and the fourth [cups], he may not drink.
They may not add an afikoman after the Pesach offering.  If a few of them changed [locations], they may eat.  If all of them [changed locations], they may not eat.  Rabbi Yossi says:  if they nod off, they may eat. If they fall asleep, they may not eat.
The Pesach offering: after midnight, it impurifies  the hands.  The disposed or the leftover [Pesach offering] impurify the hands.  [If] he recites a blessing over the Pesach offering, he exempts the [blessing] for [another] sacrifice.  If he recites a blessing over a sacrifice, he has not exempted [the blessing] for the Pesach offering, according to opinion of Rabbi Yishmael.  Rabbi Akiva says: neither this or that [blessing] exempts the other.
