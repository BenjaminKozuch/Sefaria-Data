http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/etm/

Chapter 1

Wheat and ‏darnel [rye grass] are not  <i>kilayim</i> [the product of forbidden crossbreeding or working of certain animals with one another, planting together certain plants, or interweaving certain fibers one with the other]. Barley and oats [together], spelt and rye, beans and chickpeas, small peas and the ‏<i>tofach</i> [type of bean], white beans and kidney beans are not   <i>kilayim</i> one with the other.
Cucumbers and cucumber melons are not <i>kilayim</i> one with the other. Rabbi Yehudah says, [they are] <i>kilayim</i>. Garden lettuce and wild lettuce, garden endives and wild endives, garden leek and wild leek; coriander and wild coriander, mustard and Egyptian mustard, Egyptian gourd and bitter gourd, Egyptian beans and <i>charuv</i> [Egyptian bean in carob shaped pods] are not  <i>kilayim</i> one with  another.
Turnips and radishes, cabbage and <i>trovtor</i>[type of cabbage], beets and orache are not <i>kilayim</i> one with  another. Rabbi Akivah added, garlic and wild garlic, onions and wilkd onions, lupine and wild lupine are not <i>kilayim</i> one with another.
[With regard to grafting] fruit trees: pears and crustumenian pears,  quinces and medlars are not  <i>kilayim</i> one with the other. The apple and crab apple, peaches and almonds, jujubes and <i>rimin</i> [berries from a type of thorn bush], although they are similar to each other, they are <i>kilayim</i> one with another.  
Radishes and <i>nafuz</i> [type of radish], mustard and charlock, Greek gourds with [either] Egyptian gourds or bitter gourds, although they are similar to each other, they are <i>kilayim</i> one with another.  
The wolf and the dog, the village dog [bred by villagers] and the fox, goats and deer, mountain goats and ewes, the horse and the mule, the mule and the donkey, the donkey and the wild donkey, although they are similar to each other, they are <i>kilayim</i> one with another.  
One may not bring [graft] a tree onto a tree [a fruit tree with another species of fruit tree; a fruit tree with a non-fruit tree; two non fruit bearing trees], an herb onto an herb [different species] and not a tree to an herb and not an herb to a tree. Rabbi Yehudah permits [the grafting] of herbs onto  trees.
One may not plant herbs in the trunk of a <i>shikmah</i> [a fig growing tree in the forest]. On may not graft rue onto white cassia, for that is [grafting] an herb with a tree. One may not plant a shoot of a fig tree into a cistus in order to provide cooling. One may not insert a vine branch  into a melon, so that it [the melon] supply it [the vine] with its water, because that is  [grafting] an tree with an herb. One may not place gourd seeds into a mallow, in order that it [the gourd seeds] be preserved, because that is  [grafting] an herb with an herb.
If one buries [stores] turnips and radishes beneath a vine, if some of the leaves are visible, he need not worry about [trangressing] <i>kilayim</i> or the Sabbatical year or the tithes;  and they may be removed on the Shabbat. If one sows wheat and barley  [together] at once, that is considered <i>kilayim</i>. Rabbi Yehuda says, it is not <i>kilayim</i>, unless there are two [grains] of wheat and one [grain] of barley or one [grain of] wheat and two [grains of] barley or one grain of wheat, barley and spelt.

Chapter 2

If a <i>se'ah</i> [specific unit of volume of seed] contains one quarter  [of a <i>kav</i>; specific unit of volume; one <i>se'ah</i> contains six <i>kav</i>] of another species [of seed] the [lesser] must be reduced [either adding to the main species or reducing the lesser one]. Rabbi Yose says, he must pick [all of it out] whether it [the quarter <i>kav</i>] is of one species or two species. Rabbi Shimon says, They [the Sages] did not say [the rule that it must be reduced] only if there is one species. The Sages say, all that is <i>kilayim</i> within the <i>se'ah</i> combines to make up the quarter <i>kav</i>.
When were these wordssaid [when does this apply]?  [With respect to]  grain with [a different species of] grain, legumes with [a different species of] legumes, grain with legumes, and legumes with grain. Rightly they have said [the term signifies a ruling handed down by Moshe from Sinai] that all kinds of garden seeds which are not used as food, combine to make up one twenty-fourth [to be considerd <i>kilayim</i>] of that which falls [is sown] into  each <i>beit se'ah</i> [A measure of area, equivalent to that area of land large enough to require a Se'ah of seeds to sow it]. Rabbi Shimon says, just as they said [their ruling to result] in stringency, so too they said [their ruling to result] in leniency. Flax with grain combine to make up one twenty-fourth of that which falls [is sown] into a <i>beit se'ah</i>.
If a man's field was sown with wheat and then decided to sow it with barley, he must wait until it [the wheat seeds] become wormy [rots in the soil] and then [he must] turn it over [with a plow so that it does grow] and afterwards he may sow [the barley]. If it [the wheat] has has already sprouted, he is not to say, "I will [first] sow [the barley], and then I will turn it over," but he must turn it over, and afterwards sow. How much must he plow? Like the forrows [he would plow] after the first rain [wide firrows]. Abba Shaul says, [He must plow] so that he does not leave [unplowed] as much [ground] as holds a quarter <i>kav</i> to a <i>beit se'ah</i>.
If a man's field was sown [with grain or legumes] and then he decided to plant it [with vines], he is not to say, "I will [first] plant and then I will turn it over," but he must turn it over  and afterwards plant. If it was planted [with vines] and then he decided to sow it, he is not to say, "I will [first] sow and then uproot," but he must [first] uproot, and then sow. [But], if he desires, he may cut down [the vines] to less than a handbreadth [of the ground and then] sow, and afterwards uproot.
If a man's field has been sown with hemp, or ‏<i>luf</i> [bulb type plant], he may not sow [on top of them], because they [do not rot and] only produce after three years [anything planted on top would constitute <i>kilayim</i>]. [A field of] grain that an aftergrowth of <i>istis</i> sprouted, similarly, if on the threshing floor different species sprouted [which are harmful to threshing], or if among fenugreek different species have sprouted [which are harmful to the fenugreek] we do not require him to weed them out. If he has weeded or cut them, we must tell him, "Uproot everything except one species."
If a man wishes to lay out his field in [straight] beds each sown with a different species, [how much space must he leave between the beds] Beit Shammai says, [the width of] three ridges on the furrowed field and Beit Hillel says, the width of a Sharon yoke [which is a wider yoke]. The words of these and the words of those are very close to each other [there is not much difference between them].
If a triangular corner point of a wheat [field] enters into a [neighboring] barley [field] it is permitted [it is not considered <i>kilayim</i>], because it is obvious that it is the end of the field. If his [field is sown] with wheat and his neighbor's [is sown] with a different species, it is permitted to sow close [to the neighbor's field] the same species [as the neighbor's field]. If his [field is sown] with wheat, and his neighbor's is [also sown] with wheat, he is permitted to sow close [to the neighbor's field] a furrow of flax [since flax is not ususally sown with wheat], but not a different species. Rabbi Shimon says, it is the same whether it is flax or any other species [they are all prohibited]. Rabbi Yose says, even in the middle of the [wheat], one may experiment with a furrow of flax [it is not considered <i>kilayim</i>].
It is prohibited to sow mustard or wild saffron close to a field of grain, but mustard or wild saffron may be sown close to a vegetable field. [One may] sow [different species] close to a fallow field, a plowed field, a [loose] stone fence, a road, a fence ten handbreadths high, a ditch that is ten [handbreadths] deep and four [handbreadths] wide, a tree that overshadows the ground [its branches are less that three handbreadths off the ground] or a rock that is ten [handbreadths] high and four [handbreadths] wide.
If a man desires to lay out his field into patches [each to be sown] with differing species, he may make [divide it into] twenty-four patches of a <i>beit se'ah</i>, each patch one <i>beit rova</i> [specific unit of volume] and may sow whatever species he so desires [in them]. If [in a grain field] there are one or two patches [each less than a <i>beit rova</i>], he may sow them with mustard ; [if there were] three, he may not sow them with mustard for it will look like a mustard field, these are the words Rabbi Meir.  The Sages say, Nine patches [for each <i>beit se'ah</i>] are permitted [to be sown with whatever you desire], ten are prohibited . Rabbi Eleazar ben Yaakov says, Even if his entire field is a <i> beit kor</i> [specific unit of volume], he may not make [sow] in it more that one patch.
Everything [even areas unsuitable for sowing] that is within the <i>beit rova</i> is included in the measurement of a <i>beit rova</i> [necessary for a separation]. [Thus] the area around the vine, or a grave, or a rock,  is included in the measurement of a <i>beit rova</i>. Grains [planted next to] other grains [require a separating distance of] a <i>beit rova</i>. Herbs [planted next to] other herbs [require a separating distance of] six handbreadths. Grains [planted next to] herbs, or herbs  [planted next to] grains, [require a separating distance of] a <i>beit rova</i>. Rabbi Eliezer says, herbs [planted next to] grains,  require a separating distance of] six handbreadths.
Grains that are bending [growing] over other grains, herbs over [other] herbs, grains over herbs, or herbs over grains, are all  permitted, except for Greek gourds. Rabbi Meir says, also cucumbers and Egyptian beans [are prohibited], nevertheless, I prefer their [the Sages'] words [view] to my words [view]. 

Chapter 3

A garden bed that is six handbreadths by  six handbreadths, one may sow five different kinds of seed within it, namely, four [species] one on [each of] the four sides of the bed, and one in the center [leaving the corners, one handbreadth by one handbreadth empty]. If it [the bed] has a border [on all four sides] one handbreadth high [and one handbreadth wide, thus the bed measures 8 x 8]  thirteen different species may be sown in it; three on each border and one in the middle. One may not plant turnip heads in the border as they will fill it up [and it appears all intermingle]. Rabbi Yehudah says, six different species [may be sown] in the middle [for a total eighteen species].
It is forbidded to sow [different] species [of seeds that are normally grown in large fields] in one bed, but [diffrent] species  of herbs may be sown in one bed. Mustard and small peas are [considered] seeds, [while] large peas are [considered] herbs. [If] a border [around a bed] that had been one handbreadth high was lowered, it remains valid, because it was originally valid. A furrow or a [dried up] water channel that are one handbreadth deep, one may sow three [different] species of seeds, one [species] on one side, and one [species] on the other side and one in the middle.
If a triangular corner point of herbs enters into a field of a different herb it is permitted [it is not considered <i>kilayim</i>], because it is obvious that it is the end of the field. If the field was sown with [one species of] herbs and he wishes to plant in it one row of different herbs, Rabbi Yishmael says, [he may do so] providing that the furrow is open [runs through] from one end of the field to the other. Rabbi Akivah says, the length [of the furrow] must be six handbreadths and the width must be its fullsize [six handbreadths]. Rabbi Yehudah says, [the furrow must be] the width of a full footstep [one handbreadth].
If one plants two rows of cucumbers, two rows of gourds and two rows of Egyptian beans [with furrows separating between them], it is permitted [because they are discernable]. [However, if he planted] one row of cucumbers, one row of gourds and one row of Egyptian beans, they are prohibited [they appear to have been planted together]. [If he planted] one row of cucumbers, one row of gourds and one of Egyptian beans, and [then ] a row of cucumbers, Rabbi Eliezer permits, and the Sages prohibit.
A man may plant cucumbers and gourds in the same hole, provided that this one leans towards this side [of the hole] and this one leans towards the other side, and the foliage of this one leans to this side and the foliage of this one leans to the other side, because whatever the Sages prohibited [in this case <i>kilayim</i>], they have decreed  only for the sake of appearances.
If his field was sown with onions and he wishes to plant in it rows of gourds, Rabbi Yishmael says, he must uproot two rows [of onions; a row is four cubits, so a total of eight cubits is made empty] and plants one row [four cubits of gourds in the middle;  so two cubits on each side remain empty], he [then] leaves the standing crop of onions over a space of two rows [eight cubits wide] and uproots two rows [of onions] and plants one row [of gourds].  Rabbi Akivah says, he must uproot two rows [of onions] and plants two rows [of gourds], he [then] leaves the standing crop of onions over a space of two rows and uproots two rows [of onions] and plants two rows [of gourds]. The Sages say, If there is not between one row [of gourds] and the next twelve cubits, he may not maintain the seeds [of onions] between them.
[If] one gourd is planted in a field of herbs it is [treated] as herbs [it is subject to the rules of herbs and requires a separation of six handbreadths], if [it is] planted in a grain field, it [the gourd] is given [a seaprating space] of a <i>beit rova</i>. If his field was sown with grain, and he wishes to plant in it one row of gourds, a space of six handbreadths is required for its tillage. If it grew [spread into the six handbtbreadth area] he must uproot in front of it. Rabbi Yose says, a space of four cubits is required for its tillage. The [Sages] said to him, Why do you apply more stringent rules to this  [gourds] than to a vine? Rabbi Yose said to them [the Sages], We indeed find that this is treated more stringently than a vine, [since] for a single vine we allow six handbreaths for its tillage , and for a single gourd we require a <i>beit rova</i> for its tillage. Rabbi Meir in the name of Rabbi Yishmael said, If there are three gourds in an area of a <i>beit se'ah</i> he may not bring [sow] any other [species of] seed  into the <i>beit se'ah</i>. Rabbi Yose ben Ha'Hoteph Efrati said in the name of Rabbi Yishmael, If there are three gourds in an area of a  <i>beit kor</i>, he may not bring [sow] any other [species of] seed  into the <i>beit kor</i>.

Chapter 4



Chapter 5

A vineyard that has become destroyed [uprooted or dried out],  if it possible to pick [grapes] from ten vines within a <i>beit se'ah</i> and they were planted according to the law [(chapter 4:6) a row of two vines opposite two and the fifth projecing like a tail], it is called a poor vineyard. A vineyard that has been planted in irregular fashion [not in sraight rows], if there are among them [five vines] two opposite three [two facing each other and one projecting like a tail], it is considered a vineyard, but if not, it is not considered a vineyard. Rabbi Meir says, Since it appears in the form of a vineyard [it has rows of vines although not in sraight rows] it is in a vineyard.
A vineyard that has been planted with less than four cubits [between each row], Rabbi Shimon says it is not a vineyard [because they are too close], and the Sages say [it is a] vineyard and we regard the middle ones as if they are not there [the outermost rows combine to the two opposite two rule].
A trench that passes through a vineyard ten [handbreadths] deep and four  [handbreadths] wide, Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says, If it [the trench] is open [runs through] from the beginning of the vineyard to the end, it has the appearance of being two vineyards and one may sow in it, and if not, it is [viewed] as a winepress [in a vineyard where it is forbidden to sow]. A winepress in a vineyard, ten [handbreadths] deep and four  [handbreadths] wide, Rabbi Eliezer says, one may sow in it, and the Sages say forbid it. A watch-mound [where the watchman stands]  in a vineyard ten [handbreadths] high and four  [handbreadths] wide, one may sow in it, but if the ends of the vine-branches became entwined [over the mound] it is forbidden.
If a vine is planted in a winepress, or in a cleft, we give it its space for tillage [six hanbreadths] and one may sow in the rest. Rabbi Yose says, If there are not four cubits there, one may not bring seeds there. It is permitted to sow in a house that stands in a vineyard.
If a man plants herbs in a vineyard, or lets them remain there [does not uproot them] he renders prohibited forty-five vines. When [are the forty-five vines prohibited]? If the vines were planted four [cubits apart] or five [cubits apart]. If they were planted six [cubits apart] or seven [cubits apart], he renders prohibited [a radius of] sixteen cubits in every direction in the form of a circle, not of a square.
If a man [is tilling his vines] and sees herbs [growing] in the vineyard, and says, When I reach them [the place where they are growing] I will pull them out,  he is permitted to do so. But if he reached them and then said], When I return [from harvesting]  I will pull them out, [if in the interim] they have increased [grown] one two-hundredths, it is forbidden.
If one is passing through his vineyard, and seeds [accidentally] fell from him, or [seeds] have gone [into the field] with manure [that he was applying] or with [the irrigation] water, or if he was sowing [seeds] and the wind blew [the seed] behind him, they are permitted [because they were planted accidentally], [but] if the wind blew them in front of him [and he sees that they fell into he vineyard], Rabbi Akivah says, If [he found] blades [that grew from these seeds], it must be turned [uprooted, so as not to grow again] up], if ears [there are kernels in the stalks, but they have not to one third their size] he must beat them [the kernels out of the stalks], if they produced grain, they must be burnt.
If one permits thorns [the species that camels eat] to remain in his vineyard, Rabbi Eliezer says, He has rendered them prohibited, the Sages say he has not rendered them prohibited, only [the only things that renders them prohibited are] such species that one [generally] retains [thorns are only prohibited in a place where there are camels]. The <i> erus</i> [lilly with an aromatic root], the <i>kisum</i> [ivy like plant that climb up walls], the <i>shoshanat hamelech</i> [king's lilly] are not <i>kilayim</i> in a vineyard. All kinds of  seeds are not <i>kilayim</i> in a vineyard [by Torah law]. [With regard to] hemp Rabbi  Tarfon says, it is not <i>kilayim</i> and the Sages say it is <i>kilayim</i>. Artichokes are <i>kilayim</i> in a vineyard.

Chapter 6

What is meant by ‏עָרִים‎ [a kind of espalier on which vines are trained]? When a row of five vines is planted near a hedge [wall] ten hands high, or near the side of a trench [ditch or cavity] ten hands deep and four wide, in that case, four amoth must be left for the cultivation of each vine, which [space] must, according to Beth Shammai, "be measured from the stem of the vine towards the field [ground];" but according to Beth Hillel, "from the hedge to the field." R. Jochanan ben Nourie saith, "Whosoever adopts either of these opinions is in error; for the Law is—If there be a space of four amoth from the stem of the vine to the hedge [or trench], the room necessary for the due cultivation of the vine must be allowed [for that purpose] and the remainder of the ground may be sown on." What constitutes the room [space] necessary for the due cultivation of the vine? Six hands in every direction. R. Akivah saith, "three hands only are required [in every direction]."
If an espalier of vines overhangs the steps of a terrace [on a hill], R. Eleazar ben Jacob saith, "When all the grapes can be gathered by a person standing on the [even] ground, four amoth [space] must be left beyond the espalier, within which [four amoth] it is prohibited to sow; but when the grapes cannot all be gathered by a person standing on the [even] ground, the prohibition [to sow] is limited to the spot covered by the espalier. R. Eleazar saith, "If a man has planted one row of vines on the even ground, and another row on the steps of a terrace, should the terrace have an elevation of ten hands from the ground, the two rows need not be considered as connected; but they must be so considered if the height of the terrace be less than ten hands.
When vines have been trained over part of the laths of a trellis, it is unlawful to sow under the remaining part [on which there are no vines]; should however any kind of seed have been thus sown, that does not consecrate the vine [render its produce unlawful]; but when the young shoots of the vine have spread over the whole trellis, whatsoever is sown underneath is unlawful. Such is likewise the case if a vine be trained over any portion of a wild tree, ‏אִילָן סְרָק‎.
When vines are trained over part of a fruit-tree [not wild], it is lawful to sow under the remaining part of the tree; and should even the young shoots of the vine have spread beyond it, they may be bent [or drawn] back, and it is lawful to sow beneath. It once happened that R. Joshua came to R. Ishmael, in the village Aziz, when R. Ishmael shewed him a vine which had been trained over part of a fig-tree, and asked, "May I sow under the remaining parts of the tree?" R. Joshua replied, "[You may]; it is lawful." He then took R. Joshua to a place called Beth Hamaganya, and shewed him a vine trained over a thick bough [or arm] of a sycamore-tree, from which many other boughs branched out, [and repeated the question], when R. Joshua decided that it was only unlawful to sow under the particular bough on which the vine had been trained; but that under all the other boughs it was lawful [to sow].
What is meant by the expression ‏אִילָן סְרָק‎ a wild tree? All trees which are not fruit-bearing. R. Meir saith, "Excepting only the olive and the fig-tree, all [other] trees are called ‏אִילָן סְרָק‎." R. José saith, "All trees with which it is not usual to plant entire fields [orchards], are called ‏אִילָן סְרָק‎ wild trees."
The ‏פסקי עריס‎, or those parts of an espalier of vines which are no longer covered with vines, must be of the extent of eight amoth, and something more, in order that it may be lawful to sow underneath. Of all the measurements established by the sages, when treating of vineyards, this is the only instance in which they require "something more," beyond the fixed measure. The expression ‏פסקי עריס‎, "part of an espalier of vines," is used when the middle of such an espalier has been destroyed, but five vines still remain on either side; if the open space between the two sides is only eight amoth, it may not be sown in; but if it is eight amoth and something more, the necessary room must be left for the due cultivation of the vine, and the remainder [of the open space] may be sown in.
When an espalier of vines, proceeding from the corner of a wall, extends beyond it (vide Fig. 1), room must be left for the due cultivation of the vines, and the rest may be sown on. R. José saith, "if this space doth not contain four amoth, it may not be sown on."
It is lawful to sow under such reeds [extending beyond the vine-espalier] as a person does not wish to cut away; but if these reeds have been thus placed with the intention to train the young shoots of the vine on them, it is not lawful to sow under them.
When branches of vines extend beyond the espalier, it is to be considered as if a plummet were pending from these branches, and all that space which comes within and under the perpendicular line of the plummet, it is unlawful to sow on. Such is likewise the case with the extending branches of a single vine. When vine-branches have been drawn from one tree to another [to connect them], it is prohibited to sow underneath them; but if they have been fastened by means of a rope [line] or [a band of] reeds, it is lawful to sow under the line; but if it [the rope] has been thus placed in order to train the young shoots of the vine thereon, it is not lawful to sow underneath.

Chapter 7

When a vine is bent, and the tops of its branches set in the ground [to propagate], it is not lawful to sow therein, [even beyond the legal distance], unless the bent tops are covered with mould three hands high. [Such is also the law] should the vine have been drawn through a dry gourd or a tube; but if it be drawn over rock or stone it is lawful to sow thereon, although the soil with which it is covered be no higher than three finger breadths. If a vine has been bent in such a manner that the main stem is out of sight [under ground] the measure, [as to legal distance], must be calculated from the second stem; i.e. the place where it rises from the ground and again becomes visible.
If three vines are bent, [and partly covered with mould], should their stems remain visible, R. Eleazar ben Zadock saith, "If there remain between them not less than four, nor exceeding five amoth in width, they [the vines] must be looked upon as connected; otherwise, they are not so to be considered." It is likewise prohibited to sow near a withered vine: should this, however, have been done, it will not consecrate [the produce]. R. Meir saith, "It is, in like manner, prohibited to set a cotton plant in a vineyard; nevertheless, if it has been done, it will not consecrate the produce [of the vineyard]." R. Eleazar ben Zadock saith, in R. Meir's name, "it is equally prohibited to set it [the cotton-plant] over a covered vine; but if this has been done it will not have the effect of consecrating [the vine]."
In the following places it is prohibited to sow, but if, nevertheless, this has been done, it will not consecrate the proceeds of the seed: these places are, the remainder of an incomplete plot of ground in the vineyard, [which does not contain the space required by law]; the remainder of an incomplete exterior space in the vineyard, [which is beyond the legal distance]; the remainder of an incomplete space between parts of an espalier of vines; and the remainder of an overhanging trellis; but whatsoever is sown under the branches of the vine, in the space legally required for its cultivation, or within the four amoth of the vineyard, becomes consecrated, [and the produce unlawful].
If a man train his own vine over his neighbour's corn, it will thereby become consecrated, and he is bound to make good to his neighbour the damage he thus has caused him; but R. Joseph and R. Simeon say, "No man can legally consecrate that which is not his own, [does not belong to him]."
R. José saith, "It once happened that a man had sown his vineyard during the seventh [sabbatical] year. 1 The case came before R. Akivah, who said, 'No man can legally consecrate that which does not belong to him.'"
If a person has forcibly possessed himself of a vineyard, sown in it, and then left it, the rightful owner, on recovering possession, must have it cut down [immediately], even if on the middle days of the festival. To what extent is he [the owner] bound to go in respect to the hire of labourers, [in case they refuse to work during the middle days at the usual rate of wages]? To the extent of one-third [beyond the usual rate]. Should the labourers exact more, the owner is not bound to comply with their demand; but may have it cut in the usual way, after the festival. From what period is the vineyard called that of the forcible [wrongful] possessor? When the name of the right owner is forgotten.
Vine branches which by a high wind have been cast among corn, [and have taken root], must immediately be cut down; but if, owing to accidental circumstances, the owner has not done so, the vine and the corn are allowed to be used. If corn or pot-herbs incline towards a vine, they must be put back, but, [if this is not done], it will not consecrate the produce. From what time does grain [planted near a vine] become consecrated? From the time it strikes root; and the grapes from the time they reach the size of a white bean. If grain is completely dry [if it be cut down] when a vine is planted near it, or if the grapes are fully ripe [when corn is sown], it does not cause either to be consecrated.
When, near vines, any thing is sown in a pot with holes, it causes consecration; but, if sown in a pot without holes, it does not. R. Simeon saith, "Both are, indeed, prohibited, yet if it has been done, it does not consecrate the produce of the vine." Should a pot, with any thing sown in it, be carried through a vineyard, [and some of the contents have dropped out, and taken root], it [the fruit of the vineyard] is prohibited as soon as the seed is grown a two-hundredth part.

Chapter 8

It is prohibited to sow kilaim in a vineyard, to allow it to grow if it has sprung up spontaneously, or to receive any benefit therefrom. It is prohibited to sow kilaim of seeds, and to allow it to grow; but it is lawful to eat of it, and, à fortiori, to derive benefit therefrom. Kilaim of clothing may lawfully be applied to any purpose, except that of dressing or clothing one's self therewith. It is permitted to rear kilaim of cattle; but it is unlawful to breed from them; and also to cause them to copulate with each other, [as a mule, gotten on a mare by an ass, with one by a stallion out of a she-ass].
It is prohibited to plough with, to cause to draw, or to drive a team composed of domestic animals of diverse kinds, or of wild animals of diverse kinds; or with a team composed of a domestic animal and a wild one, a wild with a domestic one, an unclean beast with a clean one, or a clean with an unclean one.
Whosoever drives [a team] of kilaim shall bear the punishment of the forty [stripes]; and whoever sits in the waggon or carriage is also liable to the punishment of forty stripes; but R. Meir absolves the last named [person]. It is also prohibited to fasten to a team a third animal not of the same kind as the other two, [as an ass to a team of two oxen], even though it should not assist in drawing.
It is prohibited to tie a horse [in order to break it in], to tine sides of, or behind, a waggon [drawn by oxen], and also [to tie], for the purpose of draught, [a Lybian ass] 1 with a camel. R. Jehudah saith, "Whatever is foaled by a mare may be joined with each other, although the sire should have been an ass; and, in like manner, whatever is foaled by a she-ass may be joined together, although tine sire should have been a horse; but it is unlawful to join what has been foaled by a mare with that which has been foaled by a she-ass."
It is prohibited to cause the ‏פרוטיות‎ to copulate; but it is allowed to do so with the ‏רמך‎. The ‏אדני שדה‎ is a wild animal; R. José saith, "its dead carcase, even like that of a human being, causes all that is under the cover of a tent to contract pollution." The porcupine and the ‏חולדת הסניים‎ will, as R. José says, according to Beth Shammai, "cause a person to contract pollution who has carried any portion of their carcases, which has the size of an olive, or who has touched any part of it of the size of a lentil."
The urus, or buffalo, must be considered as a domestic animal; R. José, however, saith, "as a wild animal. The dog as a wild animal;" but R. Meir saith, "as a domestic one." The hog as a domestic animal; the zebra as a wild animal. The elephant and the monkey as wild animals. It is lawful for a human being to draw, plough, or drive [together] with any of these animals.

Chapter 9

On the score of kilaim in clothing nothing is prohibited, excepting only woollen with linen; and no garments pollute through leprosy but those made of wool and of flax. The priests, while ministering in the holy Temple, wear no other garments but such as are made of wool or of flax. Camel's wool, [or hair], which has been mixed with sheep's-wool, should the larger proportion be of the camel, it is lawful to add flax thereto; but should the larger portion be of the sheep, such addition is prohibited: if the proportions are equal, it is likewise prohibited. Such is also the case where hemp and flax have been mixed together.
Chinese silk and floss silk [i.e. the outward coating of the silk-worm's cocoon or ball, which coating resembles wool], although not considered as kilaim, are nevertheless prohibited to be worn together, on account of their appearance. Bolsters and pillows are not subject to the rules of kilaim, provided man's flesh do not touch them. Kilaim may not be worn even for an instant, nor may it be put on even over ten other garments, nor yet for the purpose of avoiding oppressive duties.
Towels, mantles [for the rolls of the law], and bathing cloaks, are not subject to the laws of kilaim. R. Eleazar, however, prohibits them. Barbers' cloths are prohibited on the score of kilaim.
Shrouds for the dead, and saddle-cloths of an ass, are not subject to the law of kilaim; but the latter must not be borne on the shoulder, even to carry dung therein.
Dealers in clothes may, according to their custom, carry garments of kilaim for sale; but they may not carry them with the intention of protecting themselves therewith in warm weather against the sun, or in wet weather against the rain. Those, however, who are particular [in the observance of the law], tie the garments on a stick, and carry them over their shoulders.
Those who sew garments [tailors], may sew clothes of kilaim in their usual way [placing the garment on their laps], but they must not so place it with the intention of protecting themselves therewith, in warm weather against the sun, or in rainy weather against the wet. Those, however, who are particular [in the observance of the law], place the garment on the ground to sew it.
‏ברסין‎ [a kind of woollen counterpane, Lat. birrus], and ‏ברדיסין‎ [a kind of woollen blanket, Lat. bardiacus], and ‏דלמטיקיון‎ [Lat. dalmatica, or dalmatian cloaks], and ‏פינון‎ [Greek πινος, hose made of uncombed wool], are not to be worn until they have been examined. R. José saith, "that examination is not necessary with those which come from the sea-coast, or are brought from beyond seas," because the legal presumption is, that they have been made of hemp. Shoes or boots made of skin and lined with felt, are not subject to the law of kilaim.
Nothing is prohibited on the score of kilaim but what has been spun and woven; as it is said (Deut. 22:11), "Thou shalt not wear ‏שעטנז‎, a garment of divers sorts," [i.e. that which is hackled, spun, and twisted]. R. Simeon ben Eleazar saith, "Whosoever wears kilaim deviates from the right path, and causes his heavenly Father also to deviate from him."
It is prohibited to mix felt [with flax], because it is made of combed wool; it is also prohibited to put a hem or border of wool to a garment of linen, because it resembles the other [woven] part. R. José saith, "It is prohibited to tie a scarlet woollen band [over a linen shirt], because it is sewn on before it is tied; also to tie a woollen cord or band to a linen one, to gird one's loins withal, even though there should be a leather strap between [the two bands]."
The letters with which weavers and laundresses mark linen [and other garments], are subject to the law of kilaim [so that linen must not be marked with woollen thread; and vice versa]. If a needle [threaded either with linen or woollen thread] has been passed once only through a garment [without drawing it back through another place, thereby forming a stitch], it causes no connection, and is consequently not kilaim, and it is permitted to withdraw it on the Sabbath-day. But if the needle has been passed through twice, so that both ends of the thread are on the same side [of the stuff out of which the garment is made], that is a connection, and whoever withdraws it on the Sabbath-day is guilty. R. Jehudah saith, "it is necessary that the needle should have passed through three times." A sack and a wicker basket, to which a piece of linen or of woollen is tied, are kilaim [if sewn together].
