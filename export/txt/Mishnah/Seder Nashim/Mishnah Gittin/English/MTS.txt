[Compensation for] damages are assessed from the highest [quality  field]; and for a creditor, from the medium [quality field]; and for the payment of a <i>ketubah</i> [monetary settlement payable to a married woman upon divorce or the death of her husband], from the lowest [quality field]. Rabbi Meir says, "Even the <i>ketubah</i> [is to be paid] from the medium [quality field.]"
We do not collect[ payment] from mortgaged property [in the hands of others], when there is unmortgaged property [i.e, belonging to the debtor], even if it is from the lowest quality. We do not collect from the property of orphans except for from the lowest quality.
We do not extract [payment] for usufruct, for the improvement of the land, or for the food of a wife and daughters [of a former marriage] from mortgaged property, due to repairing the world [<i>Tikkun HaOlam</i>]. And we do not impose an oath upon the finder of an object due to <i>Tikkun HaOlam</i>.
[With regard to] orphans who are dependent on a [particular] homeowner, or [in the case that] their father had appointed a guardian for them, these people must tithe the [orphans'] fruit. A guardian who was appointed by the father, must take an oath; if the court appointed him need not take an oath. Abba Shaul says, "It is just the reverse." [With regard to] one who renders [fruit belonging to another] ritually impure, or mixes it [with <i>terumah</i>, a portion of a crop given to a Kohen which becomes holy upon separation, and can only be consumed by Kohanim or their household], or mixes [his wine with other wine used for idolatrous] libations. [If he did so] unwittingly, he is exempt [from paying damages]; if on purpose, he is liable. Kohanim who purposely render sacrifices ‏<i>pigul</i> [a sacrifice that becomes unfit, due to the intention of the officiating priest, while offering it, to consume it outside its permitted time], are liable.
Rabbi Yochanan ben Gudgodah testified about a deaf woman whose father had married her off that she may leave her marriage with a bill of divorce; and about a female minor Israelite who was married to a Kohen that she may eat <i>terumah</i>, and if she dies her husband inherits her [property]; and about a stolen beam that nwas built into a castle that[ the owner] collects its monetary [value], dut to the enactment of returning[ stolen objects]; and about a stolen sin-offering that was unknown to the public [when offered in the Temple] does provide atonement, due to the enactment [on behalf] of the altar. 
The law of the Sicarii was not in force in Judea during the time of the war when many Jews were being killed, but from that time on it did apply. How so? If one purchased land from the Sicarii, and then he purchased it from its [rightful] owner, the sale is void; however, [if he purchased it] from the owner and then he purchased it from the Sicarii, the sale is valid. If one purchased [a field] from the husband, and then he purchased it from his wife, the sale is void; but [if he purchased it first] from the wife, and then he purchased it from the husband, the sale is valid. This was the first teaching. But a different court decided that one who purchases [a field] from the Sicarii must pay a quarter to the [rightful] owner. This is when it is not in [the owner's] ability to repurchase [his field]; but if he has the ability to repurchase the field, [the owners] are preferred over anyone else [to repurchase the field]. Rabbi [Yehudah HaNasi] established a court and they decided by consensus that if [a field] remained in the hands of  the Sicarii for twleve months, whoever precedes others gains the rights [to purchase the filed] but he must pay a quarter to the [previous] owner.
A deaf person may indicate and be indicated to [with signs between contracting parties]. Ben Beteirah says, "Mouthing [words] and being mouthed to [is effective] for movable property." [With regard to] children at the age of discernment, their purchase and sale is valid with regard to movable property.
These are the things they said [i.e., enacted] due to "ways of peace:" A Kohen should read [the Torah] first, and after him a Levite, and after him an Israelite due to "ways of peace;" we place the <i>eruv</i> [halachic merging of separate domains by means of setting aside an amount of food in a designated place] in an old house, due to "ways of peace"; the well nearest to the water-course must be filled first, due to "ways of peace." [With regard to] traps for wild animals, birds or fish or traps are included in the laws of theft, due to "ways of peace." Rabbi Yossi says, "It is a real felony." What a deaf person, a person who exhibits signs indicating severe mental incompetence, or a minor finds [is his own], and [stealing from him] is included in the laws of theft. due to "ways of peace." Rabbi Yossi says, "It is a real felony."  In the case of a poor person beating down olives from the top of a tree, that which is under him is included in the laws of theft. Rabbi Yossi says, "It is a real felony." We do not prevent non-Jewish poor from gathering <i>leket</i>[that which is dropped in the course of harvesting, which is reserved for the poor] the forgotten [grain], and the produce of the corner of the field [reserved for the poor], due to "ways of peace."
One woman may lend to another who is suspected [not to observe properly the laws] of the Sabbatical year, a flour-sieve, a winnow, a handmill, and a stove, but she may not assist her to winnow nor to grind. The wife of a ‏<i>chaver</i> [one learned in, and observant of, the law] may lend to the wife of an unlearned person, a flour-sieve or a winnow, and may aid her to winnow, to grind, or to sift; but as soon as water is poured over the flour, she may not further assist her, for we may not aid those who transgress the law. All of [these permitted acts] are due to "ways of peace." We may aid non-Jews [who works in the fields] during the Sabbatical year, but [we may not] aid an Israelite; and we ask how he is, due to "ways of peace."
