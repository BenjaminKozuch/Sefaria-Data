Chapter 2

[With regard to] one who brings a bill of divorce from overseas and said, "It was written in my presence, but it was not signed in my presence;" [or,] "It was signed in my presence but it was not written in my presence;"  [or,] "The whole [bill of divorce] was written in my presence, but [only] half of it  was signed in my presence;" [or,] "Half of it was written in my presence and all of it was signed in my presence," it is invalid. [If] one says, "It was written in my presence," and one says, "It was signed in my presence," it is invalid. [If] two say, "It was written in our presence," and one says, "It was signed in my presence," it is invalid. But Rabbi Yehudah declares it valid. [If] one says, "It was written in my presence," and two say, "It was signed in our presence," it is valid.
If it was written in the daytime and signed in the day time,  [or written] at night and signed at night, [or written] at night, but signed in the daytime, it is valid. If it was written in the daytime, but signed at night, it is invalid. But Rabbi Shimon declares it valid, as Rabbi Shimon would say, "All documents written during the daytime and signed at night are invalid, except for bills of divorce."
One may write [a bill of divorce] with any [material]: with ink, with paint, with red paint, with gum, or with vitriol black, and with every other permanent material. One may not write [it] with a drink, nor with fruit juice, nor with any impermanent material. One may write [it] on anything: on an olive leaf; on a cow's horn, but he must give her the cow; on the hand of a slave, but he must give her the slave. Rabbi Yossi HaGelili says, "One may not write on anything that has the spirit of life, nor on foods." 
One may not write [it] on anything that is attached to the ground. [If] one wrote it on something attached, [and] he detached it and signed it and gave it to her, it is valid. Rabbi Yehudah declares it invalid, until its writing and its signing be on something that is detached [from the ground]. Rabbi Yehudah ben Beteirah says, "One may not write it erased paper, nor on hide prepared for writing, because it can be [easily] forged." But the Sages declare it valid.
All are qualified to write a bill of divorce, even a deaf-mute, an imbecile and  a minor. A woman may write her own bill of divorce, and the husband his receipt [for the amount of the <i>ketubah</i> [monetary settlement payable to a married woman upon divorce or the death of her husband] he has paid her], because the affirmation of legal documents depends solely on the signers. All are valid [agents] to bring a bill of divorce, except for a deaf-mute, an imbecile, a minor, a blind person, and a non-Jew.
[If] a minor accepted a bill of divorce [to deliver] and came of age [before he delivered it], or a deaf person and he recovered his hearing, or a blind person and he recovered his sight, or a <i>shoteh</i> [a person who exhibits signs indicating profound mental incompetence] and he became mentally competent, or a non-Jew and he converted, [the bill of divorce] is invalid. But [if he] was hearing, and became deaf and then recovered his hearing; or he was seeing, and he became blind, and then recovered his sight; or a mentally competent person, and he became a <i>shoteh</i>, and then became mentally competent again, it is valid. This is the rule: Any case in which [at] the beginning and end [he] was with [his] full faculties, it is valid.
Even those women who are not believed to say [with regard to a woman], "Her husband died," are believed to bring her bill of divorce: her mother-in-law, and the daughter of her mother-in-law, her sister-wife, the wife of her husband's brother, and her husband's daughter. What is the difference between [testifying about] a bill of divorce and [about] death? Because [with regard to the bill of divorce] the writing, [i.e., the bill itself,] proves [the testimony to be accurate]. A woman herself may bring her own bill of divorce, but she must declare, "It was written and signed in my presence."

Chapter 3



Chapter 4

If a man sends a bill of divorce to his wife via a messenger, and then catches up with the messenger, or sends another messenger after the first to say to the first messenger, "the bill of divorce that I gave to you is cancelled," then the bill of divorce is cancelled.  If the husband beats the messenger to the woman's home, or sends a second messenger who beats the first there, and says to her "the bill of divorce that I sent you is cancelled," then it is cancelled.  From the moment that the bill of divorce reaches the woman's hands, it can no longer be cancelled.
At first, a man [who had already sent his wife a bill of divorce by means of a messenger] would set up a religious court in a different place [from where the wife lived] and cancel the bill of divorce.  Rabban Gamliel the Elder established that this should not be done, for the sake of the repair of the world.  At first, a man could use a different name for himself, his wife, his city, or her city.  [That is, a man could use a nickname on the bill of divorce.]  Rabban Gamliel the Elder established that one should write one's name and any other name that he has and her name and any other name that she has for the sake of the repair of the world.
A widow may only collect [the debt owed from her Ketubah] from the property of orphans if she swears an oath [Shavua]. They stopped swearing, so Rabban Gamliel the Elder instituted that she may promise [Neder] whatever they desire, and she can then collect her Ketubah.  Witnesses sign on a Get, because of societal concerns [Tikkun Olam].  Hillel instituted the <i>Prozbul</i> [a court-issued exemption from the Sabbatical year cancellation of a personal loan] because of societal concerns [Tikkun Olam]
A slave that was kidnapped and then ransomed, if [he was ransomed] in order to be a slave, he becomes a slave. If [he was ransomed] to be a free man, he does not become a slave. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: In both cases, he becomes a slave [nevertheless]. A slave whose master mortgaged him to others, and then frees him, the baseline law is that the slave is not obligated at all [to be a slave to the person he was mortgaged to]. But as a community service, they force his [second master] to [also] free him, and [the slave is forced to] write a [debt] document for his money's worth to him. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: [The slave] does not write [a debt document], but only a [document of] freedom.
One who is half [Canaanite] slave and half free-man, serves his master every other day and serves himself every other day. These are the worlds of Beit Hillel. Beit Shamai said to them: You have repaired it for his master, but not repaired it for him! To marry a slave-girl is impossible ([i.e. forbidden), for he is half-free. [To marry] a free woman is impossible, for he is half-slave! And was not the world created for the sake of reproduction, as it says (Is. 45:18) "Not for emptiness did He create it, but for settlement He formed it." Rather, for the sake of repairing the world, we force his master and he makes [the half-slave] into a free-man, and writes a writ [of release] for half his value. Beit Hillel retracted (their statement) and ruled according to the words of Beit Shamai.
Someone who sells his slave to a non-Jew or to someone outside the land of Israel, [the slave automatically] goes free. We do not ransom captives for more than they are worth, for the sake of the community. We do not help captives escape, for the sake of the community. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: [Not for the sake of the community, but] for the sake of the captives. We do not buy religious books, tefillin, and mezuzot from the non-Jews for more than their worth, for the sake of the community.
If someone divorced his wife because of her bad reputation, he may not remarry her. If it was because [she made a] vow, he may not remarry her. Rabbi Yehuda says: If the vow was known to the public, he may not remarry her. If it was not known to the public, he may remarry her. Rabbi Meir says: Any vow that required the inspection of a rabbi [to determine if it can be annulled], he may not remarry her. If it does not require inspection of a rabbi, he may remarry her. Rabbi Eliezer says: This was only forbidden for that [i.e. both prohibited a remarriage]. Rabbi Yossi b'Rabbi Yehuda said: There was an occurrence in Tzidan, where one man had said to his wife, "I swear [in the form of a konam swear] if I do not divorce you, and he divorced her. The rabbis allowed them to remarry, for the sake of the community.
If someone divorces his wife because she is incapable of having children [an ilonit], Rabbi Yehuda says: He may not remarry her. The Rabbis say: He may remarry her. She marries someone else, and she had children with that man, and she sues for her ketuba [from the first, on the basis that she is in fact capable of having children], Rabbi Yehuda says: We tell her, "The less you say, the better, [because then your first husband can claim the divorce was under false pretenses, rendering your current children as mamzerim]."
If someone sells himself and his children to a gentile, we do not redeem him.  But we redeem the children after the death of their father.  If one sells his field to a gentile, and a Jew buys it back from him, the buyer brings the first fruits from it, for the sake of the repair of the world.

Chapter 5



Chapter 6

When one person says to another, "Receive this Get for my wife," or, "Bring this Get to my wife," he may, if he likes, take it back again; but when the wife said [to the messenger], "Receive for me my Get," the husband cannot resume it. Therefore, should a husband say to the messenger, "I do not wish that you should receive it for her [as her messenger], but go and give it her [as my messenger]," he may, if he likes, resume it again. Rabbon Simeon ben Gamaliel saith, "Also, when the wife said, 'Fetch me my Get,' the husband cannot take it back."
A wife who had said, "Receive for me my Get," must produce two [sets or] pairs of witnesses; two must testify [and say], "She uttered this [order] in our presence," and two more to say, "The messenger received the Get, and tore it up in our presence;" the same witnesses may however testify to the truth of both assertions, or one of the first and one of the second pair of witnesses may conjoin with them a third person to bear testimony. A betrothed girl may either receive her Get herself, or her father may receive it for her. R. Jehudah saith, "That right cannot be possessed at the same time by both parties; but her father only has a right to receive her Get." Any female who is too young to take proper care of her Get, cannot be divorced at all.
When a female minor said, "Receive my Get for me," the Get is ineffective until it has reached her hands. Therefore, should the husband wish to revoke the Get, he is at liberty to do so, because a minor has not the power of appointing a messenger [or deputy]; but if her father said [to the messenger], "Go and receive my daughter's Get," the husband cannot revoke it. When a husband says, [paragraph continues] "Give this Get to my wife in the place N. N." and the messenger gave it her elsewhere, the Get is void. [But if the husband had only said] "My wife is in the place N. N." and the messenger gave it her in another place, it is valid. When a woman says, "Receive for me my Get in such a place," and the messenger received it for her in another place, it is void; but R. Eleazar declares it valid. If she said, "Bring me my Get from such a place," and he fetched it from elsewhere, it is valid.
When a wife says, "Bring me my Get," she may [if married to a priest] continue to eat heave till the Get has been delivered into her hands. When she said to a messenger, "Receive my Get for me," she may not, from that instant, eat any longer of the heave. If she said, "Receive my Get for me, and bring it to the place N. N." she is permitted to eat heave till the time the Get can have reached that place; but R. Eleazar prohibits it immediately.
When a husband says, "Write a Get, and give it to my wife," or, "Divorce her," or, "Write a letter [‏אגרת‎] and give it her," they are to write the Get, and give it her. If he said, "Release her," or, "Provide her her maintenance," or, "Do with her as is customary," or, "Do with her as is proper," what he has said amounts to nothing. Formerly, it was held that when a criminal was led out with an iron collar [to the place of execution], and he said, "Write a Get for my wife," they should write it, and deliver it to her. It was afterwards decided, also those that are about going to sea, or to travel with a caravan [in the desert]. R. Simeon Sazuree saith, "Also those who are dangerously ill."
If a person who was cast into a pit, called out from thence, that whoever should hear his voice should write a Get to his wife, they shall write it and deliver it to her. When a person in health says, "Write a Get for my wife," he must be considered as if joking with her. It once happened that a person in health said, "Write a Get for my wife," and then went on his roof, from whence he fell and died; Rabbon Simeon ben Gamaliel saith, "The sages decided upon that occasion, that if he fell down with premeditation [on his part] the Get is valid, but not if the wind blew him down."
If a husband says to two [men], "Give a Get to my wife," or to three, "Write a Get, and give it to my wife," they shall write, and deliver it to her. If he said to three, "Give a Get to my wife," the latter can depute others to write it, because he constituted them a tribunal. Such is the dictum of R. Meir, and this doctrine R. Hanina of Ono brought with him from prison; [he said] "I have received a tradition, that when the husband said to three men, 'Give my wife a Get,' that they may depute others to write it, because the constituted them a tribunal." R. José saith, "We tell this emissary, We [also] have a tradition, that when a husband had said even to the Great Tribunal in Jerusalem, 'Give my wife a Get,' the latter are bound to study [the laws of Get], write a Get, and deliver it to the wife." When a husband says to ten [men], "Write ye and deliver a Get to my wife," one of that number shall write, and two others sign it, but if he said, "Write it all of ye," then one shall write, and all must sign it. Therefore, if one of them should die, the Get becomes void.
