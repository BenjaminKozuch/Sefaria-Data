Chapter 1



Chapter 2

[With regard to] one who brings a bill of divorce from overseas and said, "It was written in my presence, but it was not signed in my presence;" [or,] "It was signed in my presence but it was not written in my presence;"  [or,] "The whole [bill of divorce] was written in my presence, but [only] half of it  was signed in my presence;" [or,] "Half of it was written in my presence and all of it was signed in my presence," it is invalid. [If] one says, "It was written in my presence," and one says, "It was signed in my presence," it is invalid. [If] two say, "It was written in our presence," and one says, "It was signed in my presence," it is invalid. But Rabbi Yehudah declares it valid. [If] one says, "It was written in my presence," and two say, "It was signed in our presence," it is valid.
If it was written in the daytime and signed in the daytime,  [or written] at night and signed at night, [or written] at night, but signed in the daytime, it is valid. If it was written in the daytime, but signed at night, it is invalid. But Rabbi Shimon declares it valid, as Rabbi Shimon would say, "All documents written during the daytime and signed at night are invalid, except for bills of divorce."
One may write [a bill of divorce] with any [material]: with ink, with paint, with red paint, with gum, or with vitriol black, and with every other permanent material. One may not write [it] with a drink, nor with fruit juice, nor with any impermanent material. One may write [it] on anything: on an olive leaf; on a cow's horn, but he must give her the cow; on the hand of a slave, but he must give her the slave. Rabbi Yossi HaGelili says, "One may not write on anything that has the spirit of life, nor on foods." 
One may not write [it] on anything that is attached to the ground. [If] one wrote it on something attached, [and] he detached it and signed it and gave it to her, it is valid. Rabbi Yehudah declares it invalid, until its writing and its signing be on something that is detached [from the ground]. Rabbi Yehudah ben Beteirah says, "One may not write it erased paper, nor on hide prepared for writing, because it can be [easily] forged." But the Sages declare it valid.
All are qualified to write a bill of divorce, even a deaf-mute, an imbecile and  a minor. A woman may write her own bill of divorce, and the husband his receipt [for the amount of the <i>ketubah</i> [monetary settlement payable to a married woman upon divorce or the death of her husband] he has paid her], because the affirmation of legal documents depends solely on the signers. All are valid [agents] to bring a bill of divorce, except for a deaf-mute, an imbecile, a minor, a blind person, and a non-Jew.
[If] a minor accepted a bill of divorce [to deliver] and came of age [before he delivered it], or a deaf person and he recovered his hearing, or a blind person and he recovered his sight, or a <i>shoteh</i> [a person who exhibits signs indicating profound mental incompetence] and he became mentally competent, or a non-Jew and he converted, [the bill of divorce] is invalid. But [if he] was hearing, and became deaf and then recovered his hearing; or he was seeing, and he became blind, and then recovered his sight; or a mentally competent person, and he became a <i>shoteh</i>, and then became mentally competent again, it is valid. This is the rule: Any case in which [at] the beginning and end [he] was with [his] full faculties, it is valid.
Even those women who are not believed to say [with regard to a woman], "Her husband died," are believed to bring her bill of divorce: her mother-in-law, and the daughter of her mother-in-law, her sister-wife, the wife of her husband's brother, and her husband's daughter. What is the difference between [testifying about] a bill of divorce and [about] death? Because [with regard to the bill of divorce] the writing, [i.e., the bill itself,] proves [the testimony to be accurate]. A woman herself may bring her own bill of divorce, but she must declare, "It was written and signed in my presence."

Chapter 3



Chapter 4

[With regard to] one who sends a bill of divorce to his wife [via a messenger], and then catches up with the messenger, or sent [another] messenger after the first, and said, "The bill of divorce that I gave to you is cancelled," then it is cancelled.  If the husband preceded the messenger [in getting] to the woman, or if he sent [a second] messenger, and he said to her, "The bill of divorce that I sent you is cancelled," then it is cancelled. If [he makes this statement] from, [i.e., after,] the moment that the bill of divorce reached her hands, he can no longer cancel it.
At first, a man [who had already sent his wife a bill of divorce by means of a messenger] would set up a religious court in a different place [from where the wife lived] and cancel [the bill of divorce].  Rabban Gamliel the Elder enacted that they not be able to do this, due to [the need for] repairing the world [<i>Tikkun HaOlam</i>].  At first, a man could change his name and her name, the name of his city, or the name of her city.   Rabban Gamliel the Elder enacted that one would write: "The man, So-and-so, and any other name that he has, and the woman, So-and-so, and any other name that she has," due to <i>Tikkun HaOlam</i>.
A widow may only collect [the debt owed from her <i>ketubah</i>, monetary settlement payable to a married woman upon divorce or the death of her husband] from the property of orphans by [taking] an oath. They stopped imposing an oath; Rabban Gamliel the Elder enacted that she may make a vow with regard to whatever they desire, and collects her <i>ketubah</i>.  Witnesses sign on a bill of divorce, due to <i>Tikkun HaOlam</i>.  Hillel instituted the <i>prosbul</i> [a court-issued exemption from the Sabbatical year cancellation of a personal loan] due to <i>Tikkun HaOlam</i>. 
[With regard to] a slave who was kidnapped and they ransomed him, if [he was ransomed] in order to be a slave, he may be enslaved. If [he was ransomed] to be a free man, he may not be enslaved. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: "Either way he may be enslaved." [With regard to] a slave whose master mortgaged him to others, and then freed him, the baseline law is that the slave is not obligated at all. However, due to <i>Tikkun HaOlam</i> they force his [second] master to free him, and [the slave must] write a document [of debt] for his money's worth to him. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: "[The slave] does not write [a debt document], rather the [original] one who freed him [does]."
One who is half slave and half free-man, serves his master one day and [works for] himself one day. These are the words of Beit Hillel. Beit Shammai said to them: "You have repaired [the situation] for his master, but for himself you have not repaired it. To marry a maidservant is impossible [i.e., forbidden], for he is half-free. [To marry] a free-woman is impossible, for he is half-slave. And was not the world created for the sake of reproduction, as it says (Isaiah 45:18) "Not for emptiness did He create it, but for settlement He formed it." Rather, due to <i>Tikkun HaOlam</i>, we force his master and he makes him a free-man, and [the slave] writes a document [of debt] for half his value. Beit Hillel retracted and ruled in accordance with the words of Beit Shammai.
[With regard to] one who sells his slave to a non-Jew or to someone outside Eretz Yisrael, [the slave automatically] goes free. We do not ransom captives for more than they are worth, due to <i>Tikkun HaOlam</i>. We do not help captives escape, due to <i>Tikkun HaOlam</i>. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: "[It is] due to the enactment of the captives. We do not buy religious books, tefillin, and mezuzot from the non-Jews for more than their worth, due to <i>Tikkun HaOlam</i>.
[With regard to] one who divorced his wife due to her bad reputation, he may not remarry her. If it was because of a vow [that she made], he may not remarry her. Rabbi Yehudah says, "[In the case of] any vow that was known to the public, he may not remarry her. [But for one] that was not known to the public, he may remarry her." Rabbi Meir says, "[In the case of] any vow that required the inspection of a Sage[to determine if it can be annulled], he may not remarry her. If it does not require inspection of a Sage, he may remarry her." Rabbi Eliezer said, "This one was only prohibited due to that one. Rabbi Yossi, son of Rabbi Yehudah, said, "There was an occurrence in Sidon with one man who said to his wife, "I take a vow if I do not divorce you, and he divorced her. The rabbis allowed them to remarry, due to <i>Tikkun HaOlam</i>.
[With regard to] one who divorces his wife because she is incapable of bearing children, Rabbi Yehudah says, "He may not remarry her." The Sages say, "He may remarry her." If she married someone else, and she had children with him, and she demands her <i>ketubah</i> [from the first husband], Rabbi Yehudah says, "We say to her, 'Your silence is better than your speaking.'"
[With regard to] one who sells himself and his children to a non-Jew, we do not redeem him.  But we redeem the children after the death of their father.  [With regard to] one who sells his field to a non-Jew, and a Jew buys it back from him, the buyer brings the first fruits from it, due to <i>Tikkun HaOlam</i>.

Chapter 5



Chapter 6

[With regard to] one who says, "Accept this bill of divorce on behalf of my wife," or, "Bring this bill of divorce to my wife," he may take it back if he wants. [With regard to ] a woman who said [to a messenger], "Accept my bill of divorce on my behalf," if [the husband] wants to take it back, he cannot. Therefore, if the husband says to [the messenger], "I do not wish that you should accept it on her behalf, rather, go bring it her [as my messenger]," he may take it back if he wants. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says, "Even if she said, 'Pick up my bill of divorce,' if [the husband] wants to take it back, he cannot."
[With regard to] a wife who said, "Accept my bill of divorce on my behalf," she requires two sets of witnesses; two who [must] say, "In our presence she uttered [this order]," and two who [must] say, "In our presence [the messenger] received the bill of divorce and tore it up." Even if the first group is the same as the second group, or one of the first and one of the second pair of witnesses [as long as] another [witness] joins with them. [With regard to] a betrothed pubescent girl, either she or her father may accept her bill of divorce. Rabbi Yehudah says, "Two hands [i.e., people] cannot posses that right at the same time; rather, only her father may accept her bill of divorce." And any female who is unable to take proper care of her bill of divorce, cannot be divorced at all.
[With regard to] a female minor who said, "Accept my bill of divorce on my behalf," it is not an [effective] bill until it has reached her hands. Therefore, if the husband wished to revoke it, he can do so, because a minor cannot appoint a messenger. However, if her father said [to the messenger], "Go and accept my daughter's bill of divorce on her behalf," if the husband wished to revoke it, he cannot. [With regard to] one who says, "Give this bill of divorce to my wife in the place Such-and-such a place" and [the messenger] gave it to her elsewhere, it is invalid. [But had the husband said merely] "My wife is in Such-and-such a place" and [the messenger] gave it her in another place, it is valid. [With regard to] a woman who says, "Accept my bill of divorce on my behalf in Such-and-such a place," and he accepted it for her in another place, it is invalid;  Rabbi Eliezer declares it valid. [If she said,] "Bring me my bill of divorce from Such-and-such a place," and he brought it from elsewhere, it is valid.
[If she says,] "Bring me my bill of divorce," she may eat <i>terumah</i> [a portion of a crop given to a Kohen which becomes holy upon separation, and can only be consumed by Kohanim or their household] until the bill of divorce reaches her hands. [If she says,] "Accept my bill of divorce on my behalf," it is prohibited for her to eat <i>terumah</i> immediately. [If she said,] "Accept my bill of divorce on my behalf in Such-and-such a place," she may eat <i>terumah</i> until the bill of divorce reaches that place; Rabbi Eliezer prohibits it immediately.
[With regard to] one who says, "Write a bill of divorce , and give it to my wife," or, "Divorce her," or, "Write her a letter and give it her," they shall write it and give it [to her]. [If he said,] "Release her," or, "Provide her her maintenance," or, "Do with her as is customary," or, "Do with her as is proper," he has said nothing [of significance]. Originally, they would say [that with regard to] one who was being led out with an iron collar [to the place of execution], and he said, "Write a bill of divorce for my wife," they shall write it and give it [to her]. They retracted [that] to say, "Even one who is going to sea, or to travel with a caravan [in the desert]." Rabbi Shimon Shazuri says, "Even one who is dangerously ill."
[With regard to] one who was cast into a pit and said that whoever should hear his voice should write a bill of divorce for his wife, they shall write it and give it [to her]. A healthy person who says, "Write a bill of divorce for my wife," [it is considered as though] he wishes to joke with her. It once happened that a healthy person said, "Write a bill of divorce for my wife," and then went on his roof, and he fell and died. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said, "The Sages said, 'If he fell on his own [i.e., purposely], it is a [valid] bill of divorce; if the wind pushed him, it is not a [valid] bill of divorce."
If one says to two [men], "Give a bill of divorce to my wife," or to three, "Write a bill of divorce, and give it to my wife," they shall write, and give it [to her]. If he said to three, "Give a bill of divorce to my wife," the latter [may] tell others to write it, because he made them a tribunal; these are the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Hanina of Ono brought this law with him from prison, [as he said]: "I have received a tradition, that when he said to three, 'Give my wife a bill of divorce,' that they may tell others to write it, because he them a tribunal." Rabbi Yossi said, "We said to the messenger, We [also] have a tradition, that even if he said to the High Court in Jerusalem, 'Give my wife a bill of divorce,' that they must learn [the procedures of a bill of divorce], write a bill of divorce, and give it [to her]." If he said to ten [men], "Write a bill of divorce for my wife," one of them shall write, and two [shall] sign it; [but if he said], "Write it all of you," then one shall write, and all [shall] sign it. Therefore, if one of them should die, the bill of divorce becomes void.
