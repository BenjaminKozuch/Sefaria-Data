Chapter 1

Shammai says: For all women, their hour [of discovering menstrual blood] suffices [to reckon the period of their impurity from that moment]. Hillel says: [the period of impurity is reckoned retroactively] from [the previous] examination to [the latest] examination, even for many days [i.e. she is assumed to have been impure the entire time]. The Sages say: [the law is] not according to this one nor according to that one, but rather [the period of impurity is reckoned] from that time to that time [on the previous day, i.e. twenty-four hours earlier, when this] lessens [the period] from examination to examination; and [it is reckoned] from [the previous] examination to [the latest] examination [when this] lessens [the period] from that time to that time [on the previous day, twenty-four hours earlier]. For any woman who has a regular period, her hour [of discovering menstrual blood] suffices [to reckon the period of her impurity from that moment]. And if a woman uses checking-cloths [literally: witnesses, to clean herself before and after intercourse], this is thereby like an examination, and it lessens [the period of impurity] from [being measured from] that time to that time [i.e. twenty-four hours earlier], or from [the previous] examination to [the latest] examination.
How is it that her hour [of discovering menstrual blood] suffices [to reckon her impurity from that moment]? If she was sitting on a bed and was occupied with handling pure things [i.e. foods or vessels], and she left and [then] saw [blood], she is impure, and they are all pure [since her impurity is reckoned only from that moment]. Even though they said [regarding a woman who does not have a regular period]: she renders items impure from that time to that time [i.e. from twenty-fours hours earlier, retroactively], she only counts [her days of menstrual impurity] from the hour she saw [blood].
Rabbi Eliezer says: There are four [types of] women whose hour [of discovering blood] suffices [to reckon their impurity from that moment]: a virgin, a pregnant woman, a nursing woman, and an elderly woman. Rabbi Yehoshua said: I only heard [this law] regarding a virgin, but the law is in accordance with Rabbi Eliezer. 
Who [is considered] a virgin [such that her hour suffices]? Any who has never seen [menstrual] blood all her days, even if she is married. A pregnant woman? [She is considered to be pregnant] once her fetus becomes known [i.e. at the end of her first trimester]. A nursing woman? [She is considered to be nursing] until she weans her child [i.e. for twenty-four months]. If she gave her child to a nursemaid, or weaned him, or if he died [within twenty-four months], Rabbi Meir says: she is rendered impure [retroactively] from that time to that time [on the previous day, i.e. twenty-four hours earlier]. And the Sages say: her hour [of discovering blood] suffices [to render her impure only from that moment].
Who is [considered] an elderly woman? Anyone who has gone through three seasons [without menstruating], approaching her old age. Rabbi Eliezer says: any woman [i.e. young or old] who has gone through three seasons [without menstruating], her hour [of discovering blood] suffices [to reckon her impurity from that moment]. Rabbi Yose says: a pregnant or nursing woman who has gone through three seasons [without menstruating], their hour suffices [to render them impure only from the moment of discovering blood]. 
And concerning what did they say that her hour suffices?  [They said this] regarding the first observation [of blood], but by the second [observation] she is impure [retroactively] from that time to that time [twenty-four hours earlier]. And if she saw her first observation as a result of compulsion [i.e. if it was caused unnaturally, as by an accident], even for the second  observation her hour suffices [to reckon her impurity from that moment]. 
Even though they said that her hour suffices, she should be examining [herself], except for a <i>niddah</i> [a female who has menstrual discharges which render her impure], or one who is sitting over pure blood [i.e. following a period of impurity after giving birth, there is a period of days during which a woman remains pure even if she sees blood].  And she should have intercourse using checking-cloths [literally: witnesses, before and after intercourse], except for one who is sitting over pure blood, or a virgin whose blood is pure. And she should examine twice [daily], in the morning and at twilight, and when she going to have relations with her husband [literally: her house]. More [restricted] than this are priestly women [for they should examine themselves] at the hour that they eat from <i>terumah</i> [a portion of a crop given to a priest which becomes sanctified upon separation, and can only be consumed by priests or their household, and which should not be rendered impure]. Rabbi Yehuda says: [they should examine themselves] also when they are leaving from having eaten <i>terumah</i>.

Chapter 2

Every hand that examines frequently, regarding women, this is praiseworthy; and regarding men, it should be cut off. Regarding a deaf woman, an insane woman, a blind woman, or a woman whose cognition has been impaired, if they have able-minded women [to care for them], they prepare them [i.e. help them check themselves and immerse for purity], and they may then eat <i>terumah</i> [a portion of a crop given to the priests which becomes designated as such upon separation, and can only be consumed by priests or their household, and which one is forbidden to render impure]. It is the way of the daughters of Israel to have intercourse using two checking-cloths [literally: witnesses], one for him, and one for her. The modest ones prepare a third, to prepare herself [literally: the house, before intercourse].  
If [blood was] found on his [checking-cloth], they [the woman and her husband] are both impure, and are liable to bring a sacrifice. If it is found on hers immediately [after intercourse], they are impure, and are liable to bring a sacrifice. If it is found on hers after some time, they are impure as a matter of uncertainty, and they are exempt from bringing a sacrifice. 
What is [considered to be] after some time? As long as it takes for her to descend from the bed and rinse her [nether] face. And afterwards [if she found blood], she [retroactively] renders impurity from that time to that time [twenty-four hours earlier], but she does not render impure the man who had intercourse with her. Rabbi Akiva says: she also renders impure the man who had intercourse with her. And the Sages agree with Rabbi Akiva regarding one who sees a [blood] stain, that she renders impure the man who has intercourse with her [after she saw the stain]. 
All women are presumed to be pure for their husbands [i.e. husbands may presume that their wives are pure]. Those who return from a journey, their wives are presumed to be pure for them. Beit Shammai says: she requires two checking-cloths [literally: witnesses] for each and every time she has intercourse [i.e. so she can check them the next day], or she must have relations by the light of a candle [i.e. she must use a checking-cloth after intercourse and examine it by candlelight then]. Beit Hillel says: two checking-cloths suffice for her for the whole night. 
The Sages analogized women through a parable: a chamber, a corridor, and an upper chamber. The blood of the chamber is impure. If [blood is] found in the corridor, its uncertainty is impure [i.e. there is an uncertainty regarding its origin, and it is thereby impure], because it is presumed to have come from the source [i.e. from the chamber]. 
Five kinds of blood in a woman are impure: the red, and the black, and like the brightness of a crocus, and like earthy waters, and like diluted wine. Beit Shammai say: also like fenugreek water, and like the waters of roasted meat. And Beit Hillel consider these [last two] pure. Regarding that which is yellow [literally: green], Akavia ben Mahalalel considers it impure, and the Sages consider it pure. Rabbi Meir said: even if it does not render impurity as a [blood] stain, it [nonetheless] renders impurity as a liquid.   Rabbi Yose says: neither thus, nor thus.    
What is [considered] red? Like the blood of a wound. Black? Like ink-sediment; [black which is] deeper than this is impure, paler than this is pure. And [what is considered] like the brightness of a crocus? Like the clearest [shaded petal] in it. And like earthy waters? [Like the reddish earth] from the Bet Kerem valley, with waters floating over it. And [what is considered] like diluted wine? Two parts water, and one [part] wine, from wine of Sharon.

Chapter 3

Regarding a woman who miscarries a piece [of flesh], if there was blood with it, she is impure; it not, she is pure. Rabbi Yehudah says: either way she is impure.
If she miscarries something like a membrane, like a hair, like dust, like red flies, she should put it in water, [and] if it dissolves she is impure; and if not, she is pure. If she miscarries something like fish, [like] locusts, [like] <i>shekatzim u'remashim</i> [small animals, such as reptiles, insect, or rodents, which move by scurrying, creeping, slithering, etc.], if they had blood with them, she is impure; and if not, she is pure. If she miscarries something like a [domesticated] animal, a beast, or a fowl, whether pure or impure ones [i.e. kosher or not kosher], if it is male, she should sit for [the number of postpartum days of impurity and purity required for one who gives birth to] a male; and if it is female, she should sit for [the number of postpartum days of impurity and purity required for one who gives birth to] a female. And if [its sex is] unknown, she should sit for [the number of days of impurity and purity required for one who gives birth to] a male and for [one who gives birth to] a female [i.e. she should be stringent in both directions, with a longer period of initial impurity, and a shorter period of subsequent purity], according to Rabbi Meir. And the Sages say: anything that does not have a human shape is not [considered to be] a fetus [with regard to the purity status of one who gives birth].  
If she miscarries a sac full of water, full of blood, or full of strands [of flesh], she need not be suspicious that it was a fetus. But if its was assembled [into a human form], she should sit for [the number of postpartum days of impurity and purity required for one who gives birth to] a male and for [one who gives birth to] a female. 
If she miscarries a sandal [i.e. a piece of flesh without a face, similar in shape to a sandal] or a placenta, she should sit for [the number of days of impurity and purity required for one who gives birth to] a male and for [one who gives birth to] a female. If a placenta is in a house, the house is impure [as from the impruty of a corpse]; not because a placenta is a fetus, but because there can be no placenta without a fetus. Rabbi Shimon says: the fetus [that was in the placenta] dissolved [into the blood and was nullified] before it came out [and therefore the house is not impure].
If she miscarries an asexual [fetus], or an androgynous [fetus], she should sit for [the number of days of impurity and purity required for one who gives birth to] a male and for [one who gives birth to] a female. If [she miscarries] an asexual [fetus] and a male [fetus, at once], or an androgynous and a male, she should sit for [the required number of days for one who gives birth to] a male and for [one who gives birth to] a female. If [she miscarries] an asexual [fetus] and a female [fetus, at once], or an androgynous and a female, she should sit only for [the required number of days for one who gives birth to] a female. If it emerged in pieces or backwards, once the majority of it has emerged it is regarded as having been born. If it came out normally, [it is not considered born] until the majority of its head has emerged. And what is [considered to be] the majority of its head? Once its forehead emerges. 
If she miscarries, and it is unknown what it is, she should sit for [the number of days of impurity and purity required for one who gives birth to] a male and for [one who gives birth to] a female. If it is unknown whether it was a fetus or not, she should sit for [the required number of days for one who gives birt to] a male and for [one who gives birth to] a female, and for [being] a <i>niddah</i> [a female who has menstrual discharges which render her impure; i.e. she should be stringent in all directions].   
If she miscarries on the fortieth day [since her prior immersion], she need not be concerned that it was a fetus. If [she miscarries] on the forty-first day, she should sit [for the required number of days] for a male and for a female, and for [being] a <i>niddah</i>. Rabbi Yishmael says: on the forty-first day she should sit for [the required number of days for one who gives birth to] a male and for [being] a <i>niddah</i>. On the eighty-first day she should sit for a male and for a female and for [being] a <i>niddah</i>, because [the formation of] a male is completed in forty-one [days], and a female in eighty-one. And the Sages say: this and that [are both completed] in forty-one.

Chapter 4

The daughters of Samaritans are [considered to be] <i>niddot</i> [females who have menstrual discharges which render them impure] from their cradle. And Sameritans render impure that which they lie upon, [rendering] the bottom one [impure, even without touching it,] just as the top one, since they have intercourse with <i>niddot</i>, and they [their wives] sit [counting seven days of impurity] on account of any [kind of] blood [even blood which does render them impure, which thereby throws off their count]. But one is not liable for entering the Temple [while impure] on account of [having been rendered impure or carrying something which has been rendered impure by] them, nor is <i>terumah</i>  [a portion of a crop given to the priests which can only be consumed by priests or their household, and which one is forbidden to render impure or consume while impure] burned on their account [if rendered impure by them], because their impurity is uncertain.
The daughters of Sadducees, so long as they are accustomed to walking in the paths of their fathers, are thereby [regarded] as Samaritan women. If they left [those paths] to walk in the paths of Israel, they are thereby as Israelites. Rabbi Yose says: they are always like Israelites, until they leave [that path] to walk in the paths of their fathers.
Regarding the blood of a gentile woman, and the pure blood of a leprous woman [i.e. during her postpartum days of purity], Beit Shammai consider it pure; and Beit Hillel say: it is like her spit or her urine [i.e. it renders impurity only while damp]. Regarding the blood of a woman who gave birth and did not immerse, Beit Shammai say: it is like her spit or her urine. And Beit Hillel say: it renders impurity when damp or dry. And they are in agreement that if she gave birth while in a state of <i>zov</i> [i.e. while she was a <i>zavah</i>, a female who has certain types of atypical genital discharges, distinct from her menses, which render her impure], that she [i.e. her blood] renders impurity when damp or dry. 
A woman having difficult labor is [considered to be] a <i>niddah</i> [if she saw blood during her days of <i>niddah</i>]. If she had difficult labor [and saw blood] for three days within the eleven days [of <i>zivah</i>, between <i>niddah</i> periods], and she ceased [having pains] from that time to that time [twenty-four hours later], and she gave birth, she has thereby given birth in a state of <i>zov</i> [i.e. while she was a <i>zavah</i>], according to Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Yehoshua says: [she must have ceased having pains for] a night and a day, like the night of Shabbat its day [i.e. for a full night and subsequent day, and not for any twenty-four hour period]. This applies to one who ceased [for that time] from her pain, but not [necessarily] from bleeding.
How far [from birth] must her difficulty be [for her pains to be considered a difficult labor]? Rabbi Meir says: even forty or fifty days [before the birth]. Rabbi Yehuda says: [being in] the [ninth] month is sufficient for her [to consider her pains to be caused by difficult labor]. Rabbi Yose and Rabbi Shimon say: difficult labor is not for more than two weeks [before birth].  
A woman who was in difficult labor during the eighty days of [purity following the fourteen days of impurity after giving birth to] a female, all blood that she sees is pure, until the fetus emerges. And Rabbi Eliezer considers them impure. They said to Rabbi Eliezer, "Just as in a case where one is stringent regarding blood when pain has ceased [i.e. that such blood renders the woman who gives birth impure] there is a leniency regarding blood during difficult labor [i.e. which does not render her impure], in a case where one is lenient regarding blood when pain has ceased [i.e. during the days of postpartum purity, which does not render her impure], does it not follow logically that we should be lenient regarding blood during difficult labor [that it, too, should not render her impure]?!" He said to them, "It is sufficient for the case inferred to be treated in the same manner as the one from which it is inferred! Regarding what were they lenient with her? Regarding the impurity of <i>zivah</i>. But she [who was in difficult labor during her postpartum days of purity, if she saw blood during her days of <i>niddah</i>, and not her days of <i>zivah</i>, she] is impure with the impurity of a <i>niddah</i>.  
Throughout all the eleven days [between each period of <i>niddah</i>] she is presumed to be pure. If [during her days of <i>niddah</i>] she sat and did not examine herself, [whether] unintentionally, under duress, or if she intentionally did not examine herself, she is pure. If the time of her regular period arrived and she did not examine herself, she is thereby impure.   Rabbi Meir says: if she was in a hiding place when the time of her regular period arrived and she did not examine herself, she is thereby pure, because fear banishes blood. But [a woman] during the days of <i>zov</i> [i.e. the period of eleven days between <i>niddah</i> periods], or a <i>zavah</i> [who is supposed to be counting seven days of purity], or one who should be waiting a day [of purity] opposite each day [of impurity], they are thereby presumed to be impure [if they did not examine themselves].   

Chapter 5

For a Caesarean section, one does not sit for the days of impurity or the days of purity, and one is not liable to bring a sacrifice. Rabbi Shimon says: it is a through it was birthed [regularly]. All women render impurity from [when the blood reaches] the outer chamber, as the verse says (Leviticus 15): "blood will be her flow within her flesh." But a <i>zav</i> [a male who has certain types of atypical genital discharges, which render him impure] and a <i>ba'al keri</i> [a male who has had a seminal emission but has yet to purify himself by immersion in a <i>mikveh</i>] do not render impurity until their impurity emerges to the outside.
If a man was eating <i>terumah</i> [a portion of a crop given to the priests which can only be consumed by priests or their household, and which one is forbidden to render impure or consume while impure] and he felt his limbs tremble violently [i.e. he has a seminal emission], he should hold his member [to prevent the discharge] and swallow the <i>terumah</i> [already in his mouth]. And they [the discharges of a <i>zav</i> or a <i>ba'al keri</i>] render impurity in any amount, even the size of a mustard seed, or smaller than that. 
A baby girl one day old can become impure as a <i>niddah</i>. At ten days old she can become impure as a <i>zavah</i> [a female who has certain types of atypical genital discharges, distinct from her menses, which render her impure]. A baby boy one day old can become impure as a <i>zav</i>, or impure by having <i>nega'im</i> [diseased patches on skin, clothes, or houses that create impurity], or impure through [contact with] the impurity of a corpse; and he can be <i>zokek</i> [i.e. create a bond of <i>zikah</i>, the bond between a widow waiting for either leverite marriage tor <i>chalitzah</i>, and the man upon whom the obligation to perform leverite marriage has fallen] for <i>yibum</i> [the obligation to perform leverite marriage]; and he can exempt one from <i>yibum</i> [leverite marriage, i.e. if his father dies, he counts as a son to except any of his uncles from having to do <i>yibum</i>]; and he can feed <i>terumah</i> [i.e. his existence can render <i>terumah</i> permissible to one for whom it was formerly forbidden, such as his widowed mother if she was not a priest's daughter]; and he can render <i>terumah</i> to be forbidden [to one who was formerly permitted to eat it, such as his widowed mother if she was a priest's daughter and married an Israelite]; and he can inheret or cause others to inherit [portions of an estate]; and one who kills him is liable; and he is thereby fully like a son-in-law to his father and to his mother and for all his relatives. 
A girl three years and one day old can become sanctified [for marriage, i.e. engaged] through intercourse; and if she had relations with a <i>yavam</i> [one obligated to perform leverite marriage], he has acquired her [as his wife]; and one is liable for [having relations with] a married woman because of her [if she is married]; and she renders one who sleeps with her impure [if she is a <i>niddah</i>], and able to render impure that which hes sits upon, the lower [layer of bedding, even if he does not touch it directly], just like the upper [layer of bedding]. If she marries a priest, she can eat <i>terumah</i>. If someone invalid had relations with her, she becomes invalid for the priesthood. If any one of the illicit relatives stated in the Torah had relations with her, they are put to death due to her, but she is exempt. If she is younger than that, it is like putting a finger in an eye.
If a boy of nine years and one day has relations with his <i>yevamah</i> [a widow of his childless brother], he acquires her [as his wife]. And he does not [need to] give her a divorce document, until he grows up. And he can be rendered impure by a <i>niddah</i>, to be able to render impure that which hes sits upon, the lower [layer, even if he does not touch it directly], just as the upper [layer]; and he can render one [with whom he had relations] to invalid [from being able each <i>terumah</i>]; and he cannot feed one <i>terumah</i> [i.e. cause someone to be allowed to eat it on his account]; and he can render an animal invalid from upon the alter [i.e. if he had relations with it, that is sufficient to render it invalid as a sacrifice], and it is stoned on his account. And if he had relations with any of the illicit relatives stated in the Torah, they are killed on his account, and he is exempt.
Regarding a girl of eleven years and one day, her vows are examined [i.e she is questioned in order to determine if her vows are valid]. A girl aged twelve years and one day, her vows stand, and we check for the whole age of twelve.   A boy aged twelve years and one day, his vows are checked. A boy aged thirteen years and one day, his vows stand, and we check for the whole age of thirteen.   Preceding this time, even if they said, we know in whose name we vowed, and whose name we sanctified, their vows are not vows and their sanctifications are not sacred.   After this time, even if they say, we don't know in whose name we vowed, and in whose name we sanctified, their vows are vows and their sanctifications are sacred.
The sages spoke of a woman in a parable: an unripe fig, a fig in its early ripening stage and a ripe fig.  "An unripe fig": while she is yet a child;  "A fig in its early ripening stage": when she is in her youth.  For both of them her father is entitled to anything she finds and to her handiwork and to the right to annul her vows.  "A ripe fig"— as soon as she becomes of majority age, her father has no longer any right over her. 
What are her signs?  Rabbi Yose the Galilean says: the appearance of the wrinkle beneath the breast.  Rabbi Akiva says: from when the breasts hang down.  Ben Azzai says: the darkening of the ring around the nipple.  Rabbi Yose says: [the development of the breast to a stage] when one's hand is put on the nipple it sinks and only slowly rises again.  
A woman of twenty who did not bring forth two hairs, she must bring evidence that she is twenty years of age and she is an aylonit, she doesn't perform halitzah or levirate marriage.  A man of twenty years who did not bring forth two hairs, he  must bring evidence that he is twenty years old and he is a eunuch and he doesn't perform halitzah or levirate marriage, the words of Bet Hillel.  Bet Shammai says: both this one and that one at the age of eighteen.  Rabbi Eliezer says: In the case of the male, according to the words of Bet Hillel, while in that of the female, in accordance with the words of Bet Shammai, since a woman matures earlier than a man.  

Chapter 6

If the lower sign appears before the upper sign, she can perform halitzah or levirate marriage.
If the upper sign appears before the lower sign, even though this is impossible:
Rabbi Meir says: she doesn't perform halitzah or levirate marriage.
And the sages say: she can perform halitzah or levirate marriage. 
For they have said: it is possible for the lower sign to appear before the upper sign, but it is impossible for the upper sign to appear before the lower sign. 

Similarly, any [hole in] an earthen vessel that lets in a liquid  will  let it out, but there may be one that will let liquid out and will not let it in.   
Any limb that has a nail also has a bone in it, but there may be one that has a bone in it but does not have a nail.   

Whatever is susceptible to midras impurity is also susceptible to corpse impurity.
But there are things that are susceptible to corpse impurity but not to midras impurity.   

Anyone who is fit to try capital cases is also fit to try monetary cases.
But there are those who are fit to try monetary cases and and unfit to try capital cases.
Anyone who is eligible to act as judge is eligible to serve as a witness.
But there may be one who is eligible to act as witness and not as judge.

Whatsoever is liable for tithes is susceptible to food impurity.
But there are things that are susceptible to food impurity and not liable for tithes. 

Whatever is subject to [leaving] the corner is also subject to tithes.
But there is that which is subject to tithes and is not subject to [leaving] the corner.

Whatever is subject to the laws of the first of the fleece is also subject to priestly gifts.
But there may be that which is subject to the law of the priestly gifts and not to that of the first of the fleece.

Whatever is subject to the law of removal is also subject to the sabbatical year.   
But there is that which is subject to the sabbatical year and is not subject to the law of removal.   

Whatever has scales has fins, 
But there is that which has fins and no scales. 
Whatever has horns has [split] hooves; 
But there are those that have [split] hooves and no horns. 

Whatever requires a blessing after it requires one before it;
But there are things that require a blessing before them and not after them.

A young girl who has brought forth two pubic hairs may perform either halitzah or contract levirate marriage, and she is obligated in all the commandments in the Torah. 
So too if a young boy has brought forth two pubic hairs, he is obligated in all of the commandments in the Torah. 
He is fit to become a wayward and rebellious son from the time he has brought forth two hairs until the time when his beard forms a circle.  
This refers to the lower, and not to the upper one, but the sages spoke using a euphemism.  
A girl who has brought forth two hairs may no longer refuse the marriage. 
Rabbi Judah says:  until the black [hairs] predominate.   

The two hairs spoken of in regard to the red heifer and in regard to scale disease as well as those spoken of anywhere else must be long enough for their tips to be bent to their roots, the words of Rabbi Ishmael. 
Rabbi Eliezer says: long enough to be grasped by a finger-nail.
Rabbi Akiva says: long enough to be taken off with scissors. 

A woman who found a blood-stain, she is spoiled and must take into consideration the possibility that it was due to genital discharge, the words of Rabbi Meir. 
But the sages say: blood-stains do not contain genital discharge.

A woman who observed [a discharge of blood] on the eleventh day at twilight, at the beginning of a menstruation period and at the end of a menstruation period, at the beginning of a genital discharge period and at the end of a genital discharge period; 
On the fortieth day after the birth of a male or on the eightieth day after the birth of a female,   
At twilight in all these cases, behold these women have made a mistake [in their counting].   
Rabbi Joshua said: before you fix the situation for the women who lack intelligence, come and fix the situation for the clever ones.


Chapter 7

The blood of a menstruant and the flesh of a corpse defile when wet and when dry. 
But the discharge [of a zav], and the phlegm [of a zav] and the spit [of a zav], a dead creepy thing, carrion and semen defile when wet but not when dry. 
If they can be soaked and then revert to their original condition they defile when wet and when dry. 
And how long must they be soaked?   In lukewarm water for a period of twenty four hours.   
Rabbi Yose says: If the flesh of a corpse is dry, and it cannot be soaked and brought back to its original condition, it is pure.

A dead creepy thing which was found in an alley defiles retroactively to such time as one can say, "I examined this alley and there was no dead creepy thing in it," or to such time as it was last swept. 
So also a bloodstain found on a garment defiles retroactively to such time as one can say, "I examined this shirt and there was no stain on it" or to such time as it was last washed. 
And it defiles whether it is wet or dry.   
Rabbi Shimon says: if it is dry it defiles retroactively, but if it is wet it defiles only to a time when it could still go back and become wet.

All bloodstains that come from Rekem are pure.   
Rabbi Judah declares them impure, because the people who live there are converts though mistaken.   
Those that come from non-Jews are pure.   
Those that come from Israelites or from Samaritans:
Rabbi Meir declares them impure, 
But the sages declare them pure because they are not suspected in regard to their blood stains. 

All bloodstains, wherever they are found are pure except those that are found in rooms or around a house for impure women.
A house for impure Samaritan women defiles by overshadowing because they bury miscarriages there. 
Rabbi Judah says: they did not bury them but threw them away and the wild beasts dragged them off.

They are believed when they say, "we buried miscarriages there," or "we did not bury them." 
They are believed when they say concerning a beast whether it had given birth to a firstling or had not given birth to one. 
They are believed about the marking of graves.
But they are not believed in regard to overhanging branches, or protruding stones or a doubtful cemetary  
This is the general rule: any matter about which they are suspected they are not believed.


Chapter 8

A woman who observed a bloodstain on her body:  
If it was opposite her genital area she is impure;
But if it was not opposite her genital area she is pure. 
If it was on her heel or on the tip of her large toe, she is impure.  
On her thigh or on her feet: 
If on the inner side, she is impure; 
If on the outer side, she is pure.
And if on the front and back sides  she is pure. 
If she observed it on her garment: 
Below the belt, she is impure,  
But if above the belt, she is pure. 
If she observed it on the sleeve of her shirt: 
If it  reaches as low as her genital area, she is impure,  
But if it cannot, she is pure. 
If she takes it off and covers herself with it in the night, she is impure wherever the stain is found, since it can turn around.  
And the same law applies to a pallium jacket.

And she can attribute [the bloodstain] to any other cause to which she can possibly attribute it.  
If [for instance] she had slaughtered a beast, a wild animal or a bird, or if she was occupied with bloodstains or if she sat beside those who were occupied with them, or if she killed a louse, she may attribute the bloodstain to it. 
How large a stain may be attributed [to a louse]?  
Rabbi Hanina ben Antigonus says: one up to the size  of a split bean, and even if she did not kill it.   
She may also attribute it to her son or to her husband.
If she herself had a wound that could open again and bleed she may attribute it to the wound.

It happened that a woman came in front of Rabbi Akiva.
She said to him: I have observed a bloodstain.
He said to her: Perhaps you had a wound? 
She said to him: Yes, but it has healed. 
He said to her: Perhaps it could have opened again and let out some blood."
She said to him: Yes.
And Rabbi Akiva declared her pure. 
He saw his disciples looking at each other [in astonishment]. 
He said to them: Why do you find this difficult, for the sages did not say this rule in order to be stringent but rather to be lenient, for it is said, "And if a woman have issue, and her issue in her flesh be blood" (Leviticus 15:19) blood but not a bloodstain. 

A testing rag that was placed under a pillow and some blood was found on it: 
If it is round it is pure.  
If it is elongated it is impure, the words of Rabbi Elazar bar Zadok.


Chapter 9

A woman who was attending to her needs and observed an issue of blood: 
Rabbi Meir says: if she was standing she is impure but if she was sitting she is pure. 
Rabbi Yose says: in either case she is pure.
A man and a woman who did their needs in the same bowl and blood was found on the water:
Rabbi Yose declares it pure,  
Rabbi Shimon declares it impure, since it is not usual for a man to discharge blood, rather the presumption is that blood is from the woman. 

If she lent her shirt to a non-Jewish woman or to a menstruant she may attribute it [the stain] to her.   
If three women had worn the same shirt or had sat on the same bench and subsequently blood was found on it, all are impure.   
If they had sat on a stone bench or on the projection within the colonnade of a bath house:
Rabbi Nehemiah says that they are clean, for Rabbi Nehemiah says: anything that is not susceptible to uncleanness is not susceptible to stains.  

Three women that were sleeping in one bed and blood was found under one of them they are all impure.  If one of them checked and found that she was impure, she is impure and the other two are pure, and they can rely on each other [being the impure one]. If none of them were fit to see [blood], we view all of them as if they were fit to see [blood].
If three women were sleeping in one bed and blood was found under the middle one they are all impure.  Under the one on the inside, the two inner ones are impure and the outer one is pure.  Under the outside one, the two outer ones are impure and the inside one is pure.  Rabbi Yehuda says, when is this the case? when they entered by way of the foot of the bed, but if they entered the bed by the side, then they are all impure.  If one of them checked and found she was pure, she is pure and the other two are impure.  If two of them checked and found they were pure they are pure and the third one is impure.  If three of them checked and found they were pure, they are all impure.  To what is this comparable?  To an impure mound [containing a dead body] that became mixed between two pure mounds, if one of them was checked and found to be pure, it is pure and the other two are impure.  If two of them were checked and found to be pure they are pure and the third one is impure.  If three of them were checked and found they were pure, they are all impure says Rabbi Meir because Rabbi Meir says anything which is presumed to be impure remains impure until it becomes known where the impurity is.  But the sages say they check until the reach a rock or untouched soil.
Seven signs test for a stain, bland saliva, bean water, urine, niter, soapwort, kemunia, and potash.  If they immersed it and prepared upon it pure things and passed these seven signs on it and the stain was not removed, it is dye and does not need to be immersed.  If it was removed or faded it is a [blood] stain and the pure things become impure and it requires immersion. 
What is bland saliva?  That one anyone who has not eaten anything [that day].  What is bean water?  That made from the grits of beans that split.  Urine? That which has fermented.  And it must be washed three times with each one. If he did not do them in the right order or if he did all seven at once it does not count. 
Any woman who has reached her time, her time is sufficient [she becomes impure once she sees blood].  The following are considered her time:  If she yawns, sneezes, feels pain in her stomach, or in her lower abdomen, sees a discharge, gets shivers or any similar symptoms.  Any woman who has three occurrences of these things establishes a time for herself. 
If she used to see at the beginning of her time period anything pure that she touches during her time is impure.  If she usually sees at the end of her time period anything pure she touches during her time remains pure.  Rabbi Yossi says even days and hours can be time periods.  If she was used to seeing at sunrise only things she touched during sunrise become invalid.  Rabbi Yehuda says the whole day is hers. 
If she was used to seeing on the fifteenth day [of a month] and she changed to see on the twentieth both days are forbidden [for relations].  If she changed a second time to the twentieth both days remain forbidden.  If she sees a third time on the twentieth the fifteenth is now permitted and she has established the twentieth because a woman can only establish a time period if it happens three times.  She can only be purified from a time period if she does not see during it three times. 
Women while they are virgins are like vines.  There are vines whose wine is red, and there are vines whose wine is black. There are vines who have a lot of wine and there are vines that do not have a lot of wine.  Rabbi Yehuda says Every vine has wine in it and that which does not is a Dorketi. 

Chapter 10

A young girl who has not yet reached her time and was married, Beit Shammai says we give her four nights.  Beit Hillel say until the wound is healed.  If he time to see has come and she was married, Beit Shammai says we give her the first night and Beit Hillel says we give her until Saturday night, four nights.  If she sees while still in her fathers house Beit Shammai says we give her the intercourse of Miztvah and Beit Hillel say the whole night is hers. 
If a Niddah checked herself on the seventh day in the morning and found she was pure, and during sunset she did not separate and after a few days she checked herself and found she was impure, she is assumed to have been pure.  If she checked herself on the seventh day in the morning and found she was impure and during sunset she did not separate and after a few days she checked herself and found she was pure she is assumed to be impure and she is impure from time to time and from checking to checking.  And if it is her time period, her time is enough.  Rabbi Yehuda says one who does not separate herself from pure things from midday [on the seventh day] on is assumed to be impure.  The sages say even if on the second day of her Niddah if she checked herself and found she was pure and during sunset she did not separate and after a few days she checked and found she was impure she is assumed to have been pure. 
A Zav or Zavah who checked themselves on the first day and found they were pure and again on the seventh day and found they were pure, but the days in between they did not check, Rabbi Eliezer says they are assumed to be pure. Rabbi Yehoshua says they only have the first and seventh days [as part of their count].  Rabbi Akiva says they only have the seventh day. 
A Zav, Zavah, Niddah, a woman who had given birth or a leper who died, they transmit impurity through carrying until the flesh starts to decay.  A non-Jew who died does not transmit impurity through carrying.  Beit Shammai says all women who die have the status of Niddah but Beit Hillel says the are only a Niddah if they died while in a state of Niddah. 
A woman who died and a quarter log of blood left them, it transmits impurity because of a stain and transmits impurity through a tent.  Rabbi Yehuda says, it does not transmit impurity because of a stain since it was uprooted after she died.  But Rabbi Yehuda agrees that one sitting on a birth stool and died and a quarter log of blood left her that it transmits impurity because of a stain.  Rabbi Yossi says therefore it does not transmit impurity through a tent. 
At the beginning they would say one sitting in pure blood [after giving birth] could pour out water for the Passover offering. They then retracted saying she is like one who touched someone who touched dead body for sanctified things as Beit Hillel says.  Beit Shammai says it is as if she touched the dead body. 
And they agree that she can eat Ma'aser and she can cut off Challah, and she can bring it near and designated it.  If any of her saliva or pure blood fell on a loaf of Terumah it is pure.  Beit Shammai says she requires immersion at the end but Beit Hillel says she does not require immersion at the end. 
If a woman sees on the eleventh day and immerses that night and has relations, Beit Shammai says they both make things they sit and lie on impure and they must bring a sacrifice.  Beit Hillel says they are exempt from a sacrifice.  If she immersed on the next day and had relations and then sees Beit Shammai says they make things they sit and lie on impure and they are exempt from a sacrifice.  Beit Hillel say this person is a glutton.  And they agree that if she sees during the eleven days and she immersed that night and had relations that they both make things they sit and lie on impure and they must bring a sacrifice.  If she immersed on the next day and had relations this is improper conduct and their touching and relations are in suspension.
