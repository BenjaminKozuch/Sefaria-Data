Chapter 1

Anyone [may] slaughter -  and his slaughter is valid - except a deafmute, a <i>shoteh</i> (a person who exhibits signs demonstrating a lack of ability to think clearly) or a minor, lest they spoil the slaughter. But all who slaughter while others watch them, their slaughter is valid. The slaughter of a non-Jew is a <i>nevelah</i> (an improperly slaughtered animal of a permitted species) renders impure through lifting. One who slaughters at night, and so too a blind person who slaughters, his slaughter is valid. One who slaughters on Shabbat, or on Yom Kippur, even though he is liable for death, his slaughter is valid.
If one slaughters with a hand sickle, a flint stone, or with a reed, his slaughter is valid. All [may] slaughter, they may slaughter at any time, and they may slaughter with anything  except a reaping sickle, a saw, teeth, or a finger nail, because they strangle. One who slaughters with a reaping sickle along the direction [of the teeth], Beit Shammai invalidate, but Beit Hillel validate. If its teeth were smoothed, behold it is like a knife.
One who slaughters through the ring of the windpipe and left on it a thread's breadth around the whole of it [the circumference], his slaughter is valid. Rabbi Yose ben Rabbi Yehuda says, "[Even] a thread's breadth around the majority of it."
One who slaughters from the sides, his slaughter is valid. One who performs <i>melikah</i> (slaughtering method used for bird sacrifices, employing the thumbnail instead of a knife) from the sides, his <i>melikah</i> is invalid. One who slaughters from the back of the neck, his slaughter is invalid. One who performs <i>melikah</i> from the back of the neck, his <i>melikah</i> is valid. One who slaughters from the throat, his slaughter is invalid. One who performs <i>melikah</i> from the the throat, his <i>melikah</i> is invalid, for the whole back of the neck is valid for <i>melikah</i>, and the whole throat is valid for slaughtering. As a result, [that which is] valid regarding slaughter is invalid regarding <i>melikah</i> and [that which is] valid regarding <i>melikah</i> is invalid regarding slaughter.
[That which is] valid regarding pigeons is invalid regarding turtle-doves. [That which is] valid regarding turtle-doves is invalid regarding pigeons. [At] the beginning of yellowing [of the feathers] with either this or that, they [become] invalid [as sacrifices].
[That which is] valid for the <i>parah [adumah]</i> (a red heifer whose ashes whose ashes are added to specially drawn water, the sprinkling of which purifies those rendered impure from corpses) is invalid for the <i>eglah [arufah]</i> (a calf whose neck is broken to atone for an unsolved murder). [That which is] valid for the <i>eglah</i> is invalid for the <i>parah</i>. [That which is] valid for <i>kohanim</i> (member of the priestly caste, a subgroup of tribe of Levi, which is uniquely responsible for maintaining and carrying out the sacrificial services in the Temple) is invalid for levites. [That which is] valid regarding levites is invalid regarding <i>kohanim</i>. [That which is] pure for earthenware vessels is impure for all the [other] vessels. [That which is] pure for all the [other] vessels is impure for earthenware vessels. [That which is] pure for wooden vessels is impure for metal vessels. [That which is] pure for metal vessels, is impure for wooden vessels. The [conditions] which obligate for bitter almonds [regarding tithes] exempt for sweet ones. Those which obligate for sweet almonds exempt for bitter ones.
The <i>tamad</i>, while it has not yet fermented, is not purchased with the money of <i>ma'aser [sheni]</i> (the second tithe of produce, which must be taken to Jerusalem and consumed there) and invalidates a  <i>mikveh</i> (water collected by natural means used to cleanse ritual impurity). From when it has fermented it may be purchased with the money of <i>ma'aser [sheni]</i>, and does not invalidate a <i>mikveh</i>. Brothers who are partners, when they are obligated for the <i>kolbon</i> (a surcharge added to the half a shekel given to the Temple due to exchanging a full shekel), they are exempt regarding <i>ma'aser behema</i> (the tithe of every tenth animal from the flock or cattle, which is brought as a sacrifice). When they are obligated for <i>ma'aser behema</i> they are exempt for the <i>kolbon</i>. Any place there is a right of sale (for a father with his daughter), there are no fine (for raping or seducing the daughter).  And any place there is a fine, there is no  right of sale. Any place there is <i>mi'un</i> (the refusal to remain in a marriage by a minor,orphaned girl who was married off by her mother or brothers; the marriage is ended without a divorce), there is no <i>chalitzah</i> (the ceremony performed to release a widow of a childless man from the obligation of Levirate marriage).  And any place where there is <i>chalitzah</i>, there is no <i>mi'un</i>. When the cornet is sounded [on the eve of Shabbat] no <i>havdalah</i> is said, and when <i>havdalah</i> is said, the cornet is not sounded. When a festival falls out on the eve of the Shabbat the cornet is sounded, and <i>havdalah</i> is not said. If [it falls out] on the day after Shabbat, <i>havdalah</i> is said, but the cornet is not sounded. How is <i>havdalah</i> said [when a festival falls out on the day after Shabbat]? [Blessed art thou, etc.] "who makes a distinction between holy and holy". R. Dosa says, "who makes a distinction between the greater and lesser [degrees of] holiness."

Chapter 2

One who slaughters one [of the trachea or esophagus] for a bird, and both for cattle, his slaughter is valid. The majority of one [of the trachea or esophagus] is like [all of] it. Rabbi Yehuda says, "[Not] until he cuts the jugular veins." [If he cut] one half of one for a bird, and one and a half for cattle, his slaughter is unfit. [If he cut] the majority of one for a bird, and the majority of two for cattle, his slaughter is valid.
One who slaughters two heads in one, his slaughter is valid. When two hold the knife and slaughter, even if one [held it] at the top and one at the bottom, their slaughter is valid.
If he decapitated the head in one blow, it is invalid. If he was slaughtering and he decapitated the head in one blow, if the knife has a neck's width [outside of the neck], it is valid. If he was slaughtering and cut off two heads in one blow, if the knife has a neck's width [outside of the cut necks], it is valid. What case is being discussed? At a time when he extends [the knife] but does not bring it back [down the throat], or he brings it back but does not extend. But, if he extended and brought it back, any amount [of knife], even with a surgeon's knife, is valid. A knife that falls and slaughters, even if it slaughtered in its [proper] way, [the slaughter] is invalid, for it is said "Then you shall slaughter and then you shall eat." (Deuteronomy 27:7) That which you slaughter you eat. If the knife fell, and he picked it up; or his clothes fell and he picked them up; or he sharpened the knife and became weary; then his fellow came and slaughtered: if he delayed the amount of time it takes to slaughter, [the slaughter] is invalid. Rabbi Shimon said, "If he delayed the amount of time it takes to investigate [the knife]."
He cut the esophagus and tore the trachea; or cut the trachea and tore the esophagus; or cut one of the them and left it until it dies; or he hid the knife under the second and ripped it, Rabbi Yishbav says, “It is a <i>nevelah</i> (an improperly slaughtered animal of a permitted species).” Rebbi Akiva says, “It is a <i>tereifah</i>  (an animal with a mortal condition such that it would die within one year). A general principle said by Rabbi Yishbav in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua: “Anything invalidated in its slaughtering is a <i>nevelah</i>; anything where its slaughtering is proper, but another issue cause it to become invalid is a <i>terefah</i>.” Then Rabbi Akiva agreed with him.
One who slaughters cattle, a wild animal, or a bird, and no blood came out, they are valid are are eaten with unclean hands for they are not made fit to contract impurity by blood. ...
One who slaughters a gravely ill animal, Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says, “As long as it struggles with its fore and hind leg.” Rabbi Eliezer says, “It is sufficient if it squirts [blood].” Said Rabbi Shimon, “Even one who slaughters at night and the next day gets up and finds the walls covered in blood, it is valid, for it squirted [blood] and is like the principle of Rebbi Eliezer.” The Sages say, “Until it struggles with either its fore or hind leg, or until shakes its tail, whether for small cattle or big cattle.” Small cattle which extended its fore leg but did not withdraw it is invalid, for that is only the leaving of its life. What case is being discussed? When it is previously held to be gravely ill. But if it was previously held to be healthy, even if did not have one of these signs, it is valid.
One who slaughters for a non-Jew, his slaughtering is valid. And Rabbi Eliezer declares it invalid. Said Rabbi Eliezer, “Even if  he slaughtered it so that the non-Jew will eat from the edge of its liver, it is invalid, for the usual thought of a non-Jew is towards  idolatry.” Said Rabbi Yose, “These matters are [solved by] an a fortiori argument. Just as in a place where thought invalidates for <i>mukdashim</i> everything only follows the work, in a place where thought does not invalidate for <i>chulin</i> should it not be the rule that everything only follows the slaughtering?”
One who slaughters for the sake of mountains, for the sake of valleys, for the sake of seas, for the sake of rivers, for the sake of deserts, his slaughter is invalid. [If] two grasp the knife and slaughter, one for the sake of one from all of these and one for the sake of something fitting, his slaughter is invalid.
We may not slaughter into seas, nor into rivers, nor into vessels. But one may slaughter into a pool of water, and onto vessels [when] on a boat. We do not slaughter into a pit at all, but one makes a pit within his house so that the blood will go into it. But in the marketplace one may not do as such so as to not imitate the heretics.
One who slaughter for the sake of an <i>olah</i> (offering that is entirely burnt), for the sake of other sacrifices, for the sake of an <i>ashma talui</i> (an offering brought to expiate a sin one is unsure of committing), for the sake of the <i>pesach</i> sacrifice, for the sake of a thanksgiving offering, his slaughtering is invalid; and Rabbi Shimon validates. [If] two hold the knife and slaughter, one for the sake of one of these and one for the sake of something fitting, his slaughter is invalid. One who slaughters for the sake of a sin offering, for the sake of a guilt offering, for the sake of a first born offering, for the sake of <i>ma’aser</i>, for the sake of <i>temurah</i>, his slaughter is valid. This is the general principle: anything which is vowed or voluntarily offered, when one slaughters for its sake it is forbidden. For that which is neither vowed or voluntarily offered, when one slaughters for its sake it is fit.

Chapter 3

These are the <i>terefot</i> (an animal with a mortal condition such that it would die within one year) for cattle: a puncture of the esophagus; and a split [widthwise] of the trachea; the membrane of the brain is perforated; the heart chamber is perforated; the spine is broken and its chord is split; the liver is removed and none of it remains; the lung which is punctured or missing - Rebbi Shimon says, "Only when it is punctured through the bronchial tubes;" the stomach was pierced; the abomasum (the final stomach) was pierced; the gall-bladder was pierced; the small intestines were pierced; the inner rumen (the first stomach) was pierced; or if the majority of the outer was ripped - Rabbi Yehuda says, "[For] the larger [animals] a <i>tefach</i> (a specific unit of length), and the smaller [animals] the majority); the omasum or reticulum (stages three and two in the stomach) which were punctured to the outside; fallen from a roof; most of its ribs were fractured; and clawed by a wolf. Rabbi Yehuda says, "Clawed by a wolf for small cattle and clawed by a lion for large cattle. Clawed by a hawk for a small bird and clawed by a large bird for a large bird." This is the general rule: anything where something similar to it cannot live is a <i>terefah</i>..
These are acceptable for cattle: the trachea was perforated or if it was split [legthwise]. Up to how much can it lack? Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says, "Up to an Italian <i>issar</i> (a specific unit of money)." The skull is chipped but the membrane of the brain is not perforated; the heart is perforated but not through to its chamber; the spine is broken but its chord is not split; the liver is removed but an olive's size of it remains; the omasum and reticulum which we perforated from this to the other; the spleen is removed; the kidneys are removed; the lower jaw is is removed; its womb is removed; dried up [lungs] at the hands of Heaven. The flayed [animal], Rabbi Meir declares valid, but the Sages invalidate.
These are the <i>terefot</i> for a bird: a puncture of the esophagus; a split [widthwise] of the trachea; a weasel hit it on the head in a place that makes it a <i>terefah</i>; the gizzard is perforated; the small intestines are perforated; it fell into a fire and its intestines were scorched - if they are green, they are invalid, if they are red they are valid; trampled on, torn on a wall, or cattle ran over it and it jerks and then waits twenty-four hours and one slaughtered it, it is valid.
The following are valid for a bird: the trachea was perforated or it was split [lengthwise]; a weasel hit it on its head in a place which does not make it a <i>terefah</i>; the crop was perforated - Rebbi says, "Even if it was removed;" its insides came out but they were not perforated; its wing was broken; it leg was broken; its wing feathers were plucked. Rabbi Yehuda says, "If the down was removed, it is invalid."
Congestion of blood, one that inhaled smoke, one that became sick from cold, one that ate oleander; one that ate chicken feces or drank poor water is fit. [If] it ate poison or a snake bit it, it is permissible in regards to [the category of] <i>terefah</i>, and forbidden in regards [to the category of] endangering lives.
The signs of cattle and a wild animal are stated from the Torah, but the signs of a bird are not stated. But the Sages said, "Any bird which attacks [prey] is impure. Any that has an extra digit, a crop, and gizzard that peels [away] is pure." Rabbi Eliezer ben Rebbi Tzadok says, "Every bird which parts its toes is impure."
And for locusts, any which has four legs, four wings, and jointed legs, and its wings cover the majority of it [is valid]. Rabbi Yose says, "And [if] its name is 'locust.'" And for fish, any which has a fin and scales. Rabbi Yehuda says, "Two scales and one fin." These are they [types] of scales: those attached to it. And fins: the ones by which it swims. 

Chapter 4

[If] an animal has difficulty giving birth, and the fetus protruded its fore-leg and withdrew it, [the fetus] is permitted for eating. [If] it protruded its head, even if it withdrew it, behold it is as if it was born. A cut piece from the fetus in its womb is permitted for eating; from the spleen or kidney is forbidden for eating. This is the general rule is: anything which is part of its [the animal giving birth’s] body is forbidden. That which is not of its body is permitted.
An animal pregnant with its firstborn which is having difficulty giving birth, one [may] cut limb by limb [from the fetus] and cast it to the dogs. [If] the majority of it protruded, it must be buried and [the mother] is exempt from [laws regarding] the firstborn. 
An animal whose fetus died within its womb and the shepherd placed his hand inside and touched it, whether it is an impure animal or pure animal, he is pure. Rabbi Yose the Galilean says, “For an impure [animal], he is impure, but for a pure [animal], he is pure.”  A woman whose fetus died in her womb and the midwife placed her hand inside and touched it, the midwife is impure with a seven day impurity, and the mother is pure until the fetus comes out.
“An animal that has difficulty giving birth, and the fetus protruded its fore-leg, someone cut it off, and afterward slaughtered its mother, the flesh [removed from the fetus] is pure. [If] someone slaughtered its mother and afterwards cut [the fore-leg off], the flesh [has the impurity level] of touching a <i>nevelah</i> [an improperly slaughtered animal of a permitted species],” in the words of Rabbi Meir. The Sages say, "[The impurity level] of touching a slaughtered <i>terefah</i> [an animal with a mortal condition such that it would die within one year]. Just as we find for a <i>terefah</i> that its slaughtering purifies it, so too the slaughtering of an animal purifies the [protruding] limb.” Rabbi Meir said to them, "Not so, for if the slaughtering of a <i>terefah</i> renders clean that which is part of its body, [but] does it render clean the limb which is not of its body?” From where is it derived for a <i>terefah</i> that its slaughtering purifies it? An unfit animal is forbidden for eating [and] so too a <i>terefah</i> is forbidden for eating. Just as an impure animal is purified by its slaughter, is a <i>terefah</i> not purified by its slaughter? No. If you say [something] about an unfit animal which did not have a moment of validity, would you say [as such] about a <i>terefah</i> which had a time of validity? Take away what [the argument] you brought. Behold, if it is born as a <i>terefah</i> from the womb, from where would we derive this? [Rather], no. If you say about an unclean animal that for its kind is not [affected] by slaughtering, would you say it for a <i>terefah</i> whose kind [affecting] by slaughtering? Born alive at eight [months], its slaughtering does not render it pure, for its kind is not [affected] by slaughtering.
"One who slaughtered an animal and found within it an eight month old fetus alive or dead, or a nine month old dead fetus, one tears it up so the blood comes out. If one found a nine month old live fetus, it requires slaughtering, and is under the obligation of it and its offspring (the prohibition against killing an animal and its child on the same day)," in the words of Rabbi Meir. But the Sages say, "The slaughtering of the mother purifies it [the fetus]." Rabbi Shimon Shazuri says, "Even [if the fetus reached the age of] eight years and is plowing in the field, the slaughtering of its mother purifies it." [If] one ripped apart [an animal] and found in it a nine-month old [fetus], it requires slaughter, for its mother was not slaughtered.
An animal whose legs were cut off from the knee and below is fit; from the knee and above it is unfit, and so too when the junction of the sinews is interrupted. [If] the bone was broken, if most of the flesh is extant, its slaughter purifies it. But if not, its slaughter does not purify it.
[If] one slaughtered an animal and found a placenta inside of it, a hearty person may eat it. And it does not contract impurity as food, nor as the impurity of <i>nevelot</i>. [If] one regarded it [as edible], it contracts impurity as food, but not the impurity of <i>nevelot</i>. A placenta, some of which protruded, is forbidden to be eaten. It [the protruding placenta] is the sign of an offspring for a woman and the sign of an offspring for an animal. [For] an animal which has never given birth and miscarried a placenta, [the placenta] is cast to the dogs. For <i>mukdashim</i> [animals or food which are holy and not available for general consumption] it is buried. And we do not bury it at a cross roads and we do not hang it up in a tree, due [to the prohibition against following] the ways of the Amorites..

Chapter 5

<i>Oto ve'et beno</i> [the prohibition against killing an animal and its offspring on the same day] applies whether in the land [of Israel] or outside the land, within the Temple and not within the Temple, with <i>chulin</i> [animals or food permitted for general consumption] or <i>mukdashim</i> [animals or food which are holy and not available for general consumption]. How [does this work]? One who slaughters <i>oto ve'et beno</i> as <i>chulin</i> outside [of the Temple courtyard], both [slaughters] are valid, and the [slaughterer of the] second receives forty lashes. <i>Kodashim</i> [animals or food which are holy and not available for general consumption] outside [of the Temple courtyard]: the first [slaughterer] is liable for <i>karet</i> [Divinely imposed punishment consisting in severance from Heaven and/or the Jewish people], both [of the animals] are invalid, and both [slaughterers] receive forty lashes. <i>Kodashim</i> inside [the Temple courtyard]: the first [animal] is fit and [the first slaughterer] exempt, and the second [slaughterer] receives forty lashes and [the slaughter] is unfit.
<i>Chulin</i> and [then] <i>kodashim</i>  outside: the first is fit and is exempt, and the second receives forty and is unfit. <i>Chulin</i> and  <i>kodashim</i> inside, both are invalid and the second receives forty. <i>Kodashim</i> and <i>chulin</i> inside the first is fit and is exempt, and the second receives forty and is unfit. <i>Chulin</i> outside and inside, the first is fit and is exempt, and the second receives forty and is unfit. <i>Kodashim</i> outside and inside, the first is liable for <i>karet</i>, both are unfit, and both receive forty. <i>Chulin</i> inside and outside, the first is unfit and exempt, and the second receives forty and is fit. <i>Kodashim</i> inside and outside, the first is fit and exempt, and the second receives forty and is unfit.
One who slaughters [as part of <i>oto ve'et beno</i>] and it is found <i>terefah</i> [an animal with a mortal condition such that it would die within one year], one who slaughters for idolatry, one who slaughters the <i>parah adumah</i> [a red heifer, sacrificed and burned,  whose ashes are added to specially drawn water, the sprinkling of which purifies those rendered impure from corpses], or a <i>shor haniskal</i> [an animal stoned for killing a person by goring or similar means, which is forbidden from consumption even if slaughtered before the stoning], or an <i>eglah arufah</i> [a calf whose neck is broken by elders of the closest town to atone for an unsolved murder], Rabbi Shimon exempts and the Sages obligate. One who slaughters [as part of <i>oto ve'et beno</i>] and it becomes a <i>nevelah</i> [an improperly slaughtered animal of a permitted species] by his hand, one who [kills by] stabbing, one who tears off [the trachea or esophagus] is exempt from [violation of] <i>oto ve'et beno</i>. Two who purchased an animal and its offspring, whoever purchased first slaughters first. If the second went ahead, he is gains the right. One who slaughtered a cow and after that its two offspring, he receives eighty [lashes]. One who slaughtered its two offspring and after that slaughtered it, receives forty. One who slaughtered it and its grand daughter, and after its daughter, receives forty. Sumkhus says, in the name of Rabbi Meir, "He receives eighty." At four periods during the year one who sells an animal to his fellow needs to inform him [either], "Its mother I sold for slaughter," [or], "Its offspring I sold for slaughter." These are them: the eve of <i>shemini atseret</i>, the eve of the first day of <i>pesach</i>, the eve of <i>shavuot</i>, and the eve of <i>rosh hashanah</i>. And in the words of Rabbi Yose HaGelili, even the eve of <i>yom kippur</i> in the Galilee. Said Rabbi Yehuda, "When? At a time when [the seller] doesn't have a gap [between the sales]. But if he has a gap, he does not need to inform him [the buyer]." And Rabbi Yehuda agrees when one sells the mother to a groom and the offspring to the bride that one needs to inform him, since it is known that both will slaughter on one day. 
During these four periods we force the butcher to slaughter against his will. Even an ox worth one thousand <i>dinarim</i> [a specific unit of money], and he only has a buyer for one <i>dinar</i>, we force him to slaughter. Therefore, if it dies, the death [is a monetary loss] for the purchaser. But for the other days of the year, this is not so, and therefore if it dies, the death [is a monetary loss] for the seller.
The one day spoken about for <i>oto ve'et beno</i>, the day follows after the night. This Shimon ben Zoma expounded, "It says in the story of Creation,'One day' (Genesis 1:5), and it says for <i>oto ve'et beno</i>, 'One day' (Leviticus 22:28). Just as for the 'one day' mentioned in the story of Creation the day follows after the night, so too for the 'one day' mentioned in <i>oto ve'et beno</i> the day follows after the night.

Chapter 6

[The law of] covering the blood [after the slaughter of fowl or wild animals] applies in the land [of Israel] and outside of the land, within the Temple and not within the Temple, for <i>chulin</i> [animals or food permitted for general consumption] but not for <i>mukdashim</i> [animals or food which are holy and not available for general consumption]. It applies for wild animals and fowl, whether in possession or not in possession. And it applies to a <i>koi</i> [an animal whose domesticated status is ambiguous], since it is in doubt. And we do not slaughter it on a holiday. And if one did slaughter it, we do not cover its blood.
One who slaughters and it is found to be a <i>terefah</i> [an animal with a mortal condition such that it would die within a year], one who slaughters for idolatry, one who slaughters <i>chulin</i> inside [the Temple courtyard] or <i>kodashim</i> [animals or food which are holy and not available for general consumption] outside [of the Temple courtyard], or a wild animal or bird which was stoned [for killing a person by goring or similar means, which is forbidden from consumption even if slaughtered before the stoning], Rabbi Meir obligates [the covering of the blood], and the Sages exempt. One who slaughters and it became a <i>nevelah</i> [an improperly slaughtered animal of a permitted species] by his hand,  one who [kills by] stabbing, and one who tears off [the trachea or esophagus] is exempt from having to cover..
A deaf-mute, a <i>shoteh</i> [a person who exhibits signs which demonstrate mental deficiency], or a minor who slaughtered and others watched them, are obligated to cover. [If they slaughtered] among themselves, one is exempt [from having to] cover. So too in the matter of <i>oto ve'et beno</i> [the prohibition against killing an animal and its offspring on the same day], where they slaughtered and others watched them, it is forbidden to slaughter [the mother or the offspring] after them. Among themselves, Rabbi Meir permits slaughtering after them, but the Sages prohibit. But they agree that if one slaughtered, one does not receive forty [lashes].
..
When the blood was mixed with water, if the blood is still apparent, the obligation of covering it remains in force. If mixed with [red] wine, [that wine] must be considered as if it were water. If it was mixed with the blood of another domestic or wild animal, that blood must be considered as water; but R. Jehudah observes, "One kind of blood does not neutralise another kind."
The blood which spirts [from the throat of an animal on its being cut, and bespatters a wall, &amp;c.] and that on the slaughtering knife, it is obligatory to cover. R. Jehudah saith, "When is this the case? When there is no other blood but that; but when there is other blood besides, it is not required to do so."
With what substances is it lawful to cover the blood, and with what may it not be covered? It is lawful to cover with pulverised manure, with fine sand, with mortar, with potsherds, with bricks, or with the earthenware cover [or bung] of a barrel, viz. when these substances had been pulverised, but not with unpulverised manure, coarse sand, or brick, or earthenware covering, which had not been pounded. Nor may it be covered by merely placing a vessel over it. Rabbon Simeon ben Gamaliel laid it down as a rule, "That it is lawful to cover with any substance which would sustain vegetation, but not with substances unfit for the growth of plants."

Chapter 7

The precept concerning the prohibition of eating the "sinew which shrank" [‏גיד הנשה‎] is obligatory in and out of the Holy Land, during and after the existence of the Temple, in animals slaughtered for profane use [‏חולין‎], and in respect also to consecrated sacrifices, and applies to wild and domestic animals, and to both the right and left thighs of the animal; it does not apply to fowl, since these have no "hollow in the thigh." It applies to a fetus in embryo, and its suet [‏חלב‎] it is permitted to use. According to R. Meir, "The assertion of butchers in respect to their having removed the ‏גיד הנשה‎ [sciatic nerve] is not to be relied on;" but the sages hold, "That they may be relied on in this respect, and in that of the removal of ‏חלב‎, or suet."
It is lawful to send to a non-Israelite a thigh having the ‏גיד הנשה‎ [sciatic nerve] yet within it, because its existence is easily ascertained. In removing the ‏גיד הנשה‎ [sciatic nerve] the whole sinew must be carefully cut out. R. Judah saith, "It suffices if enough was removed so as to fulfill the precept."
A person who eats the quantity of an olive in size of a ‏[sciatic nerve] גיד הנשה‎, incurs the penalty of forty stripes. Should a person have eaten the whole of that sinew, and it was under the mentioned size, he has nevertheless incurred the same penalty. If a person eat the size of an olive of the sinews of each hip, eighty stripes are to be inflicted on him; but according to R. Judah, forty stripes only.
If a hip was boiled with the ‏גיד הנשה‎ [sciatic nerve]within it, if that sinew was of sufficient size to impart a flavor to the hip, this latter may not be used. How is this to be calculated? In the same proportion as meat boiled with turnips.
When the גיד הנשה [sciatic nerve] was boiled with other sinews, if that sinew can be recognized [it must be removed, and] the other sinews are prohibited, if it could have imparted a flavor to them. But when it cannot be recognized, all the sinews are prohibited. The broth [or liquid in which it is boiled] may not be used if the גיד הנשה [sciatic nerve] imparted a flavor to it; and it is even so if a piece of Nebelah, or of a fish prohibited to be eaten, should have been boiled with other pieces of meat or fish allowed to be eaten: if the first mentioned pieces can be recognized, they are to be removed, and if they could have imparted a flavor to the other pieces, the latter may not be used. If they could not be recognized, all the pieces are prohibited; and thus in respect to the broth, which may not be used, if the flavor of the prohibited pieces could have been imparted to it.
The prohibition of the גיד הנשה [sciatic nerve] applies to clean animals, and not to unclean ones. R. Judah said, "It must be observed also in respect to unclean animals;" for he argued thus, "The גיד הנשה [sciatic nerve] was prohibited since the time of the sons of Jacob [i.e. before the promulgation of the law], when it was not yet prohibited to use unclean animals as food." The sages replied, "This precept was first promulgated at Sinai, but it was written [incidentally] in its place."

Chapter 8

It is prohibited to boil any kind of flesh in milk, except that of locusts and fish; neither may meat and cheese be brought to table together, except locusts and fish. A person who vowed not to eat meat, may eat locusts and fish. Fowl and cheese may, according to Beth Shammai, be brought to table together, but may not be eaten together; but, according to Beth Hillel, they may neither be brought to table nor be eaten together. R. José saith, "This is one of the cases in which Beth Shammai decide in a less rigid manner than Beth Hillel." What kind of table is here alluded to? The table on which the person is eating; but on the table on which food is prepared [a dresser], both kinds may without apprehension be placed near to each other.
Meat and cheese may be wrapped up together in one cloth, if they do not touch each other [i.e. are placed in contact]. Rabbon Simeon ben Gamaliel saith, "Two guests [at an inn or ordinary] may without apprehension eat at the same table, one of them meat, and the other cheese."
When a drop of milk fell upon a piece of meat [in a pan], all the meat therein is prohibited if it could have communicated its flavor to the meat; but if the contents of the pot had been immediately stirred together [after the milk fell into it]: if it imparted its flavor to the whole, the contents of the pot are prohibited. The udder [of a cow or goat, &amp;c.] must be torn, and the milk be pressed out of it; but if it had not been torn, the person who eats it has not transgressed; the heart must also be torn and the blood pressed out. If it had not been torn, the person who eats it thus has not transgressed; and he who has fowl and cheese brought to table together has not transgressed the negative commandment.
It is prohibited to boil [in milk] or to derive any benefit from the flesh of a clean animal which was boiled in milk of a clean animal, but it is permitted to boil and to reap advantage of flesh of a clean animal boiled in the milk of an unclean one, or, of the flesh of an unclean animal boiled in the milk of a clean one. R. Akivah saith, "Wild animals and fowl are not specified in the law [as subject to this prohibition]; for it is said, 'Thou shalt not boil a kid in its mother's milk,' but this precept was mentioned three times, to include wild animals, fowl, and unclean animals. R. José the Galilean saith, "It is said (Deut. 14:21), 'Thou shalt not eat of any thing that dieth of itself' [Nebelah], and it is added immediately, 'Thou shalt not boil a kid in its mother's milk.' Consequently, those animals only which are prohibited as Nebelah may not be boiled in milk, and as it might be supposed that since a fowl may become prohibited as Nebelah, it would therefore be prohibited to boil it in milk, the Scripture uses the expression, 'in its mother's milk,' to except fowl, to which that expression cannot apply."
It is prohibited to use the curdled milk in the maw of an animal slaughtered by a non-Israelite, which is Nebelah. When a person put milk in the interior membrane of the maw of a Cashér killed animal; if the milk can impart a flavor to it, it is prohibited. The milk in the maw of a Cashér animal, which sucked from one that is Terefá, is prohibited; but the milk of a Terefá, which sucked from a Cashér animal, may be used, because the milk remains gathered [enclosed] in the intestines.
Several laws are more rigid in respect to the prohibition of eating suet [‏חלב‎] than they are in that against eating blood, and some, again, which relate to this latter prohibition, are more severe than those in respect to the first mentioned. More severe in respect to suet, inasmuch as a trespass [‏מעילה‎] may be thereby incurred, as also the guilt of having brought an abominable [i.e. unfit] sacrifice [‏פגול‎], and having eaten of what remained [‏נותר‎], and became unclean, which is not the case in respect to the blood. Some laws are more severe as regards blood, since this prohibition applies to the blood of domestic and wild animals, and also to fowl, whether they are of a clean or unclean species, but that against eating suet applies to clean animals exclusively.

Chapter 9

The skin [of a slaughtered animal], the broth, the meat dissolved by boiling, that which adheres to the bottom of a saucepan, the fragments of meat adhering to the skin when it is removed from the animal, bones [containing marrow], sinews, horns and hoofs, are computed together to form [with the edible matter or flesh in them] the quantity of the size of an egg, when they are liable to contract and communicate pollution to other edibles, but not the pollution of Nebelah. Thus also, if a person slaughters an unclean animal for a heathen, it pollutes edibles while it struggles, but it does not communicate the pollution of a dead body till life is extinct, or, if its head had been quite chopped off. There are consequently more cases in which edibles contract pollution than there are in respect to pollution by Nebelah. R. Jehudah saith, in reference to the fragments of meat adhering to the skin, "If any of these, when computed together, are of the size of an olive in any one place, guilt is thereby incurred."
In the following instances the skin is to be considered as flesh:—human skin, that of the domestic swine,  and, according to R. José, also that of wild swine, the tender skin on the hump of a young camel,  and that of the head of a young calf, the skin [between] the split hoofs, that over the matrix, and that of an animal fœtus in embryo, also that under the tail, and those of the ferret, the chameleon, the lizard, and the snail. R. Jehudah saith, "That of a lizard must be considered like a weasel[’s skin]."  If any of these had been tanned or converted into leather, or that they had been sufficiently trodden [in the process of converting the skin into leather], they are clean, excepting human skin. R. Jochanan ben Nouri saith, "The eight creeping things have skins."
When a person removes the skin of a domestic or wild animal, whether clean or unclean, large or small, in order to cover himself therewith, pollution is contracted and communicated when as much skin is removed as can be taken hold of, and if to make a bottle of skin, until the skin over the breast is removed. If the skinning was commenced from the legs, the whole is considered as connecting, and subject to contract and communicate pollution. The skin covering the neck is not considered as connecting by R. Jochanan ben Nouri, but the sages do so consider it until the whole skin is removed.
When there is the size of an olive of flesh on a skin in one spot, any person who-touches the filaments proceeding therefrom, or the hairs on the skin which are opposite [and touch the said flesh], is unclean. If there were two pieces of flesh of the size of two half olives each, it pollutes by being carried, but not by the mere touching it. Such is the dictum of R. Ishmael, but R. Akivah holds "That they do not pollute either by being carried or touched," but he admits, "That if the size of two half olives were stuck on a skewer and moved, it is unclean." Why, then, does [R. Akivah], in respect to the skin, hold it to be clean? Because the skin prevents their contact.
Whoever touches a marrow-bone of a dead body, or of a consecrated sacrifice, whether the said bones are open or closed, is unclean. Whoever touches a marrow-bone of an animal that is Nebelah, or of creeping animals, is clean when the bone is closed, but if it is open ever so little, pollution is contracted by contact with it. Whence is it proved that [the marrow-bone of a Nebelah] does also pollute the person carrying it? Because it is said (Lev. 11:24-25), "Whoever toucheth [the carcase]," and "Whoever beareth aught of the carcase," &amp;c., which proves that whatever communicates by being touched, does also communicate it by being carried, and that which cannot communicate pollution by contact, cannot communicate it by being carried.
The egg of a creeping animal, in which the young animal is already developed, is clean, but when it has the smallest perforation it renders unclean. In respect to a mouse which is yet half flesh and half earth, 16 if the flesh is touched it renders unclean, but not if only the earth thereof had been touched. R. Jehudah saith, "Whoever touches the earth which immediately adjoins the fleshy part is also unclean."
Members, or pieces of flesh which had been forcibly torn off a [live] animal, but which are yet pendant to it, are subject to contract and communicate pollution like other edibles, while they remain thus pendant in their place, but require the susceptibility of contracting pollution to be communicated to them, before they contract it. When the animal was slaughtered they may contract pollution by its blood, according to R. Meir, but R. Simeon saith, "They do not thereby contract it." When the animal dies of itself, it requires the susceptibility of contracting pollution to be communicated to it before it is unclean. The [pendulous] member does, however, pollute as a member taken off an animal while yet alive, but not as Nebelah. Such is the dictum of R. Meir; but R. Simeon saith, "That member or the pieces of flesh [above mentioned] are clean."
A limb or piece of flesh torn from a human body, but yet pendant to it, is clean [if the person is alive], but should he die, the flesh is clean, but the limb pollutes as a limb severed from a living being, but not as a part of a dead body. Such is the dictum of R. Mein; but R. Simeon holds the said limb to be clean.

Chapter 10

The law concerning the [right] shoulder, the two cheeks, and maw, due as oblation to the priest, is obligatory in and out of the Holy Land, during and after the existence of the Temple, and applies to animals for ordinary use [‏חולין‎], but not to those used as consecrated sacrifices. For it might have been concluded [thus], If in respect to animals slaughtered for ‏חולין‎, to which the precept of giving the breast and foreleg [to the priest] does not apply, it is nevertheless obligatory to give the above mentioned oblations: it would follow, a fortiori, that these oblations ought also to be given in respect to consecrated sacrifices which are subject to the gift of the breast and foreleg; but it is written [Leviticus 7:34], "[For the wave-breast, and fore-leg, &amp;c.] and have given them to Aaron the priest and his sons by a statute for ever." Hence we are taught, that the priest obtains only what is specified in the text [viz., the breast, &amp;c.].
All animals, for sacrifice, which had contracted a permanent [i.e. incurable] blemish before they were consecrated, and were ransomed, are subject to the laws concerning first-born and [the other sacerdotal] oblations, and may, like animals used for ‏חולין‎, be shorn and used for labor. The young and milk they produce after they were ransomed are also lawful for use, and no guilt is incurred if they were slaughtered outside [the temple]. They do not render an animal substituted for them a valid sacrifice, but they must be ransomed after their death. First-born of animals, and those given as tithe, are excepted. If they had been consecrated before they had contracted the blemish, or that a transitory blemish preceded the consecration, and they had subsequently contracted a permanent one, they are free, after they are ransomed, from the laws relating to first-born and other oblations; but they may not, like animals used for ‏חולין‎, be shorn nor used to labor with. The young and milk they produce may not be used, even after they were ransomed, and guilt is incurred by any person who slaughtered them outside [of the temple]. They also render an animal substituted for them a valid sacrifice, and must be buried when they die.
If a blemished first-born animal was sold by a priest to an Israelite, and had become mingled with a hundred other animals; if these were slaughtered by a hundred persons, the firstborn which is among them releases them all [of the obligation of paying the sacerdotal dues]. If they were all slaughtered by one person, one only of these animals is free. A person who slaughters for a priest, or for a non-Israelite, is not bound to pay the oblations; if he had the animals in partnership with one of these, he must mark them. If a priest sold an animal [to an Israelite], reserving the oblations, the Israelite is not bound to give them. Should one [Israelite] say to another, Sell me the entrails of [this] cow," and there is yet of the oblations among it [viz. the maw], he [the buyer], must give it himself to the priest, and [the seller] need not allow him any deduction from the purchase-money on that account; but if the animal was bought by weight, the buyer must pay the sacerdotal dues, and may deduct it from the purchase-money.
If a proselyte had a cow, which he slaughtered before he had embraced Judaism, he is free from the payment of the oblations, but not if the slaughtering took place after his conversion. In a doubtful case he is free, because the onus probandi lies with him who sets up the claim. What are the limits of the shoulder? From the bent of the knee until the hip-bone: this is also the case in respect to the shoulder mentioned in the sacrifice of the Nazarite, as also in respect to the hind-leg down to the hough [in peace-offerings]. The [limits of the] leg are, according to R. Jehudah, from the hip-joint until that of the thigh. The [limits of the] two cheeks are from their joints till the top ring of the trachea.

Chapter 11

The precept of giving to the priest the firstling of the fleece (Deut. 18:4) is obligatory in, and out of the Holy Land, 1 during, and after the existence of the Temple, and applies to animals for profane use [‏חולין‎], but not to consecrated sacrifices. The precept concerning the oblation of the shoulder, two cheeks, and maw, is more rigid than that which relates to the firstling of the fleece, in as much as the first-mentioned applies both to cattle and flock, but the latter is limited to sheep, and only when there are a number of them.
What is considered "a number"? According to Beth Shammai, two sheep come under this category, since we find it written (Isaiah 7:21), "A man shall nourish a young cow and two sheep;" but Beth Hillel say, "[At least] five, for it is also written (Samuel I 25:18), 'Five sheep ready dressed.'" R. Dosa ben Arkinar saith, "When the fleece of each of the five sheep amounts to the [minimum] weight of one half maneh, the obligation of paying the firstling of the wool is incurred;" but the sages hold, "That it is incurred as soon as five sheep are shorn, whatever the weight of their fleece may be." What quantity must be given to the priest? The weight of five selahim, in Judea, which are equal to ten selahim in Galilee, of white [i.e. clean], but not of dirty wool, and in sufficient quantity as to make therewith the smallest [sacerdotal] garment, for it is said (Deut. 18:5), "Shalt thou give unto him," viz. a sufficient gift [which has some value]. If he could not give it to the priest before it was dyed, he is not bound to give it at all. If the owner of the wool had only bleached, but not yet dyed it, he is bound to give it. If any person buys from a heathen the fleece of sheep [yet to be shorn], he is not bound to pay to the priest the firstling of the fleece. If one Israelite bought it of another, if the seller reserved some of the wool to himself, he is bound to pay this oblation, but if he sold it without such reservation, this obligation is incumbent on the buyer. If he [the seller] had two kinds of wool, gray and white, if he sold the gray but not the white wool, or of rams but not of ewes, each party must pay the oblation to the priest.

Chapter 12

The precept of letting the parent bird, found in a nest, fly away (Deut. 22:6) is obligatory, in, and out of the Holy Land, during, and after the existence of the Temple, and applies to non-consecrated birds [‏חולין‎], but not to those which are consecrated sacrifices. The law is more rigid in respect to the obligation of covering the blood, than in that of letting the parent bird fly away, in as much as the first-mentioned precept applies to wild animals and fowl, whether ready at hand or not, and the latter applies to fowl only, and to those which are not ready at hand. By this latter expression is understood such as geese or fowls, which make their nest in an open field or orchard; but those which nestled within the house, or in respect to Herodian doves, this obligation does not apply.
Nor to unclean birds, nor unclean birds incubating the eggs of clean birds, nor these latter hatching the eggs of unclean birds. R. Eleazar holds "That it is obligatory to set at liberty a cock partridge found in a nest," but the sages do not consider this necessary.
If the dam was fluttering about the nest, if she touched it with her wings, it is obligatory to let her fly away, but not when her wings do not touch it; if there was but one young bird, or one egg, it is nevertheless obligatory to let the dam fly away, because the Scripture uses the term (Deuteronomy 22:6): "nest," i.e. any nest. When some of the young birds are already on the wing, or that the eggs are addled, the precept does not apply, for it is written, "And the dam sitting upon the young birds, or upon the eggs." Even as the young birds are supposed in the text to be live ones, thus also must the eggs be fit for incubation [and to produce life], from which term addled eggs are [of course] excluded; and even as the eggs [to complete the process of incubation] require the care of the dam, thus also must the young bird mentioned in the text yet require the nurture of the dam, consequently those birds which are already able to fly are excluded. Should a person have let the dam fly away, and she returns constantly to the nest, even four or five times [or oftener], he is bound to let her fly away, for it is said, "Thou shalt surely let the dam go," &amp;c. When a person says, "I take the dam, and set the young birds free," he must let the dam go also, since it is written, "Thou shalt surely let the dam go." If he takes the young birds first, and then puts them again in the nest, and the dam returns, he is no longer bound to let her fly away again.
When a person has taken the dam and the young birds from the nest, he shall, according to R. Jehudah, suffer the punishment of the stripes, but he is not bound to let the dam fly away; but the sages hold, "That he is bound to let her fly, but is free of the punishment." For this is the rule, "For the transgression of a negative precept, which may be rectified by an act, no punishment is to be inflicted when that rectifying act has been done."
The dam and the young birds are not to be taken from a nest, even to [serve as a sacrifice] to cleanse the leper. If the Holy Law attaches so much importance to this precept, which is so easy to be observed, and though scarcely demanding the sacrifice of the value of an issar, does nevertheless use the expression (Deuteronomy 22:6): "That it may be well with thee, and that thy days may be prolonged," how much more precious must be the reward attached to the observance of other [more difficult] precepts of the Holy Law.
