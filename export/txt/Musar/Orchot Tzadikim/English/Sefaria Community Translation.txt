INTRODUCTION
"The end of the matter, when all is heard, is to fear God and safeguard his commandments, for this is the entirety of man" (Ecclesiastes 12:13). This verse was [written] by King Solomon, who was wiser than all men, and ruled the upper and lower realms (Megillah 11b). And after he saw all actions, and tested all things, and taught many wise things to the world, he concludes his whole [book] with the words, "the ultimate matter is to fear of God". Likewise, Proverbs (1:7) begins, "Fear of God is the beginning of knowledge", and ends (ibid. 31:30), "A woman who fears God is the praiseworthy one". If another man exhorted us to fear God - the world would not accept his words and would say, "Since he has no other affairs, and is idle, therefore he exhorts the fear of God". But Solomon was richer than all men, as it is written (Kings 1 10:27), "And the king gave out silver in Jerusalem like stone", and he was wiser than all men, as it is written (ibid. 5:11), "And he became wiser than all men". He was fit to say (Ecclesiastes 1:2), "Vanity of vanities, all is vanity", and that one should only toil in fear of Heaven. So too did Moses, the father of all wise men and prophets, say in the Torah (Deuteronomy 10:12) "And now Israel, what does the Lord your God ask of you? Only to fear the Lord your God". So too did King David say (Psalms 111:10), "The beginning of wisdom is the fear of God".
Since we see that man is God's chosen creation of the lower world, that he is constructed in the image and form of God, more carefully created than than all created things, and that he has a soul that can understand the foundation of the upper and lower [worlds]; we [can] know that he is the matter of all [God's] intentions for this world, and that all things in this world were created for his needs. Therefore, man was given the true Torah, to teach us the proper way [of life]. For man is very beloved to God, as [seen from the fact] that the angels work [to fulfill] the needs of righteous men, as we know from Abraham and Isaac, and as Jacob said (Genesis 48:16), "May the angel that that saves me from all evil bless the youth", and as it is written (Hosea 12:5) "and he strove with an angel and prevailed", and as Daniel said (Daniel 6:23), "God sent an angel, and he closed the mouths of the lions and they did not hurt me". We find that angels also come to help the righteous, as it written (Kings II 19:35) And it was that night that an angel of God went out and struck the camp of Assyria", and many similar [passages]. We also know that one have much more worth than another, to the extent that one man [can be] equal to many others. Even though they are all of one form and foundation, this man's soul has risen to great heights that are higher than that of his peers, because he made his wisdom rule over his desires, whereas the others let their desires reign over their wisdom, and go though their whole lives in darkness, groping like a blind man in the dark.
Man has five senses: 
1) The sense of hearing, ...
2) the sense of sight, ...
3) the sense of smell,...
 4) the sense of taste, ...
and 5) the sense of touch, that which one feels when using something.
These actions compose all of man's actions, and no action is done without one of these five senses. And the heart acts on them, because everything is brought to the heart with these five senses, and so every action and thought is drawn after them. The hear has many thought patterns, such as arrogance and humility, remembrance and forgetting, agony and happiness, embarrassment and insolence, and many more like these. And all of these though patterns draw strength from the five senses, for a blind man can not be as haughty as he would be if he could see.
Therefore, all [capably]-hearted men should try with all of their strength to attain the ultimate good; if one reaches a good [spiritual] level, he should always reach for the level above it, until he attains the ultimate good and gains the world of reward - i.e. the World to Come - with it. Kind David desired to attain the good of the world to come, saying (Psalms 31:20) "How much is the good that You have hidden away for those who fear You", and (ibid. 36:9) "They will be filled with the fat of Your house, and they will drink from the brook of Your delights". But this level [of reward] is only reached by the deserving, as [David] wrote, (ibid. Ch. 16) "Who can live in Your tent and dwell in Your holy mountain, those who go [about] wholesomely and do righteousness...", see further there.
And since we mentioned the value of the [spiritual] levels of man, we should explain their laudable and denigratable and good and bad [parts], until the path before the thinking one is clear and he can enter the King's courtyard; he will choose the good character traits with all of his strength, as he knows clearly what they are, discarding the chaff and taking the wheat.
How so? Some men are naturally angry and are always angry, while others are of a settled mind and only get slight angry over a period of many years. Some people are naturally lustful, and cannot be satiated from their pursuit of their desires, and some are very pure of body and don't even desire the little that the body needs. Some people are greedy and could not be satisfied by all of the money in the world (as [the verse] says (Ecclesiastes 5:9), "One who loves money will never be satisfied by it"), while others are content and find just a small amount sufficient, and do not pursue all of their needs. Some people will mortify themselves out of stinginess, and won't even spend a penny unless [to relieve] great suffering, while others knowingly abandon their money. And all of these ways and traits, such as the exuberance and mournfulness, miserliness and generosity, cruelty and compassion, cowardice and bravery, etc. -
- of all of these traits, some a person has from the moment of his creation as part of his physical nature, while others a person is predisposed to and will acquire them faster than other traits. Some are not intrinsic to a person; and he needs to be them by others, or he reflects on them due to a thought that came to mind, or he hears that that this trait is good and worth following; and he practices it until it becomes ingrained in his heart.
