Siman 1

All may slaughter, at the outset, even women.  Slaves and virtually anyone even though you do not know them who does not faint because of slaughtering. (is fit for slaughtering.) Even though you do not know where or whether he learned the laws of slaughtering. It is permitted from the outset to accept what he slaughters and permitted to eat it as well. This is because most are familiar with his slaughtering and his expertise is known as well. What are we saying? (We are saying) that if that person is not in front of us it is permitted to eat what he slaughters because we rely on what is generally known. However if he is before us we need to check if he is an expert in the laws of slaughtering, however we do not need to ask if he faints.




...The one who is deaf and speaks but cannot hear: He does not perform the slaughter since he does not hear the blessing. If he performs the slaughter, even if it just for himself, the slaughter is valid.
...One who hears but does not speak: if he is an expert, he performs the slaughter even from the outset if another says the blessing.
...A drunk who has reached the drunkenness of Lot--his status is like one who is crazy. If he has not reached the drunkenness of Lot--he may perform the slaughter from the outset. Rem'a: There are those who say that a drunk does not perform the slaughter  because he often comes to chopping (instead of cutting).
...One who is blind: He does not perform the slaughter from the outset unless others are watching him. If he performs the slaughter, his slaughter is valid.
...One who is naked: He does not perform the slaughter from the outset because he cannot say the blessing.
...If a community vowed that only a certain butcher would perform the slaughter, and another goes and performs the slaughter: there those who say that his slaughter is forbidden. Rem'a: If they abolished the decree--all butchers are assumed to be valid as before.

ritual slaughter of [a kosher animal done by] a worshipper of stars [meaning non-jew; the animal slaughtered has the status of a] Nevilah, even [if the ritual slaughtering was done by a non-jewish] minor and even if its not a non-jew (for example a ger toshav) even if others [who are jews] supervise him

There are eight types of terefot, and their signs are D"N (final), HN"K (initial), N (initial), P"Sh: attacked (derusah),  perforated (nekuvah), missing (haserah), removed (netulah),  torn (keruah), fallen (nefulah), severed (pesukah), and broken (sheburah). 

Siman 30

If in a behemah (domesticated animal) or chaya (wild animal), most of the bone of the head is crushed, either most of its vault (gab) or most of its circumference (hekkef), the animal is a trefah, even though the membrane is intact.

1. The punctured lung is treif
2. The lung has five (<i>ear-shaped</i>) minor lobes, three on the right and two on the left side, as the animal is suspended by its feet and its guts face the slaughterer, such that the slaughterer's and the animal's right sides are one.  On the right side there is another small lobe called the "small roseate lobe", not in line with the minor lobes, rather it projects from the front.  If one is missing from the right or the left, or if there were two on the right and three on the left, the lung is terefah. <i>HGH"H: The shapes of the right minor lobes are unlike those of the left ones.  If they are reversed in shape - terefah.  Similarly if the right middle minor lobe is larger than the lower minor lobe - terefah. If the upper left minor lobe is larger than the upper right minor lobe - terefah.  Similarly, if the major right lobe is larger than the left - all this is called 'reversed' and is terefah.  The roseate small lobe - if it's absent, or if it's on the left side - kosher. HGH: In these lands we regard zero or two small roseate lobes, or a roseate lobe on the wrong side, terefah, and it is proper to do so, and many of our rabbis agree, and custom should not be changed. Similarly, if its appearance or shape differs from the norm - terefah.  If there are two roseate lobes with a common finger-thick base: even though it has a crack, it's kosher.  And if one is upside down and the other normal, we follow the larger, if that is right side up, it's kosher.  The roseate lobe is normally in a pocket.  </i>

A limb from a live animal is forbidden from a domesticated animal, a wild animal, or fowl.
A limb that separates from a live animal is forbidden. And flesh that separates from a live animal is forbidden because of "And the flesh in the field Treifah." And even what separates from the animal [but] is still inside it - such as [where it was] cut from the spleen or from the kidneys and the piece was left inside it - it is forbidden.

Siman 63

Meat that was found spread out in the market, one goes after the majority, because a part goes after the majority of parts. If the majority of the sellers [of meat] are non-Jews, it is forbidden. And if the majority of the sellers are Jews, it is permitted. And this is the case with meat that was found in the hand of a non-Jew and it is not known from whom he purchased it. If the meat sellers are Jews, it is permitted. This is the law [according to] Torah. And the Sages already forbade all meat that is found, either at the market or in the hand of a non-Jew, even though all the sellers and all of the slaughterers are Jews. And furthermore, the one who buys meat and places it in his house and it disappears, it is forbidden [to eat it]. Rather, if there is a sign or there were recognizable rings [on the meat], and he definitely recognizes it that it is the [same meat] or it was bound and stamped, [then the meat is permitted].

Siman 68










One is not permitted to scald kids and lambs and chicken in a kli rishon [first vessel] unless the fat has been removed and the meat has been salted. And likewise, one may not pour onto them from a kli rishon, and if you do pour, it is enough [to remove] a klippah [outer layer] of the skin. And if the head of the chicken is above where the pouring occurred, a klippah is not even required.  Rema: It is not considered 'pouring' unless there was no stopping of the stream from the kli rishon when it was touching down, but if there was a break it is already not considered a pouring and it is not forbidden. 

Siman 69

Meat needs to be washed before it is salted. (if the butcher washed it, there is no need to wash it in the house, tur). If, after washing, the piece was cut into two or three (or the hooves were removed after washing, aruch), returning and rewashing is necessary. 
If it was salted but not washed first, rinse it and salt it again. There are some who forbid this practice. Rema: This is our custom, even if it was only salted a little bit, like the amount of salt used before it is roasted, and even if it was not salted for a shiur melicha (aruch, sharei durah, and semag). One who is in danger of a great loss can be lenient (beit yosef), and if it was just rinsed a little before salting it is acceptable after the fact. This is the rule if the piece of meat is 60 times the volume of the blood that is on it (Sharei Durah in the name of the Mahari). If one salted an unwashed piece of meat with other pieces of meat, the other pieces are acceptable and the unwashed one is forbidden (aruch).
Don't use salt that is as fine as flour, and don't use salt that is too thick because it will fall off the meat. Rema: and if one only has salt that is as fine as flour, it is acceptable to use it.
One should scatter salt so that no place remains without salt. And, one should salt so that it [i.e. the meat] won't be fitting for eating with the same amount of salt. There is no need to add more salt than this. It should be salted on both sides. Birds need to be salted also on the inside. If they are only salted on the inside or on the outside, and likewise with pieces [of meat] that are only salted on one side, these are permitted. Gloss: And there are those who forbid this even after the fact, and this is the custom if there is no great need for the meat [i.e. to feed guests, or shabbat is starting soon. This means that it is permissible to use meat salted on one side even from the outset if there is a need for it.]. But if the meat hasn't been cooked, one should not cook it as is, but if it's within 12 hours of having been salted should instead salt the second side that hasn't been salted and then cook it afterwards. If it has been after 12 hours of being salted then one should roast it on the fire, and the fire certainly draws it [i.e. the blood] out, and the side that was salted won't absorb [blood] from the side that wasn't salted.
After you salted the piece of meat, if you cut that piece, there is no need to return and salt the place where the meat has been cut.
The length of salting the meat is not less than the length it takes [in time] to walk a mile, and this is approximately a third of an hour. Gloss: And this is authoritative after the fact, or even from the outset [if the meat is needed in order to] to honor guests or for the needs of Shabbat. But, without this [need] the custom is to wait with the meat being salted for the length of an hour, and this cannot be changed.
Before one places the meat in the vessel that it will be washed in, one should shake off the salt that's on it or wash it in water and afterwards place the meat in the vessel that it's being washed in and wash it several times. The vessel should be washed between each and every rinsing [of the meat]. Gloss: And there are those who say that the meat needs to be washed three times and this is the custom from the outset, therefore if one washes or shakes off the salt from among it and washes it twice, this is like washing it three times. Or one places the water in the vessel and afterwards places the meat in it and washes it three times. And this is the custom from the outset, that one gives lots of water in the first rinsing in order to nullify the strength of the salt that's in the brine. It's permitted to wash the meat in fruit juice, and water is not required. 
If one did not shake off the salt that is on [the meat] and did not rinse it [off], the [meat] is not forbidden because the water in the vessel will negate the strength of the salt. Rema: Even a small amount of water will negate the strength of the tzir. (Aruch, klal 6 and Mahari). There are those who permit [the meat] even if there was no water in the vessel when the meat was placed there since we aren't concerned about the short amount of time while the person is washing the meat. (Share Durah). We can rely on this. We only worry about all this for the first washing, but after the first washing there is no concern. (Such are the words of the Mordechai and the Ran). And there is no difference between washing in a vessel that is kosher, non-kosher, or dairy. As long as there is a little water in the vessel to negate the strength of the salt so that it is not cooking, even if the vessel is dairy or non-kosher, or dirty with forbidden things. (Aruch).
Meat that was salted and then cooked without a final washing must  have a sixty ratio (19) [34] against the salt that is upon it.  Rema: (20) [35] And the entire pot is included in the sixty, [36] and if  there is a piece of meat in the pot of equal size to this piece that was  not washed off, everything is permitted for there must be sixty times  the amount of salt on the piece (21), for the piece is certainly at least  sixty times it's salt, and if there is not sixty times against the salt  [37], even if only placed in a kli sheini everything is forbidden (23)  since [38] there is salt and tzir, it has cooked somewhat.  [39] Dried meat can be permitted even in a kli rishon, for it must  certainly be sixty times the size of the salt that is upon it since it has  dried. However, initially one must be careful even with dry meat that  it should not be cooked or even washed in hot water without being  first washed of it’s salt. All this is referring to a case where meat has  not been washed off of it's salt at all, however if even only slightly  washed once, and then cooked, it is permitted, post facto , for post  facto one washing is sufficient. Salt used once, [40] may not be  used again, [41], and it goes without saying that it is forbidden to eat  used salt.   
[42] A non-Jew who works in Jew’s home, who is cooking a piece of  meat that we’re not sure if it was washed off is subject to the following  halacha: If the non-Jew knows Jewish customs, we may believe to say he  washed it off if there was an adult Jew occasionally walking in and out, or  if there was a knowledgeable child. Rema:  One of these is sufficient (24) [43] either mesiach Ifi tumo that he washed  it well, or a Jew, even a child was around walking in and out for he has  some respect for Jewish customs. However if he told the non-Jew not to  wash meat without permission, and the non-Jew went and did so, it is  forbidden for we see that he has no fear and he should not be relied on.   
[44] Meat that has been cooked without having been salted is permitted if  there are [45] sixty times (26) that piece in the pot, (27) and all the other  meat is permitted as well. Rema: (28) [47] Some forbid that piece even if  there is sixty against it, and that is how we are to act if not for a great need  (2) as in honour of Shabbos or [47] guests when we may rely on those  who are lenient. If a piece of meat was not salted (30) properly it is as if it  was never salted. Any meat that stood for three days without having been  salted remains forbidden even if salted and if it is [48] cooked we require  sixty against it.
Meat that was left for three full days without having been salted can no  longer be saltedbecause the blood has dried and will no longer be  released through salting. Therefore it [49] may not be cooked [50] only  roasted (31) and after it is roasted [51] it still may not be cooked (32) but if  it was it is permitted. [52] Meat should not be left for three days for fear  that it may be cooked.   
(33) [53] If the meat was soaked in water within three days, it may go  another three days (34) (54) less half an hour. Meat that we are not sure if  it was salted within three days is permitted. 
Meat that was left unsalted for three days [55] and was then mixed up with  other pieces is [56] nullified [57] among the permissible majority, and [58]  all the pieces may be cooked (35) [59] even if it was a chaticha ha’ruya  I’hischabed. This is also the rule for pieces cooked without being salted,  and then mixed with others.  
(36) [60] Meat covered in blood that was sitting in water for twenty four hours is  forbidden by some unless it is roasted (37) [61] or unless there is sixty in the  water against it, [62] Some even forbid it to be roasted, and this is how we should  act. 
We perform the salting only in a vessel with holes or upon straw or shavings or in  a diagonal position insuring that if water was spilled onto it, it would flow off  immediately. Rema: An especially smooth surface that water would flow from  need not be placed in a slanted position. however if it’s not this smooth it must be placed slanted so that the water flows out. Even in a vessel with holes, one  should be careful to make sure the holes are open, therefore it should not be  placed on the ground, for then it is as a vessel without holes. As a result of this  some people are stringent and place straw or shavings because even the meat  can close up the holes. (38) Post facto, one need not worry about all this. If one  performed the salting in a vessel without holes (39) [63] it is forbidden to use the  vessel with very hot items. Rema: [64] And if it was used then one must take off a  klipah for a dry item, and if it was a liquid we need sixty against the klipah of the  vessel. [66] Some say that even with cold items it is forbidden to use the vessel  unless it is washed down well, and if it was used without first being washed off,  the item used should be washed off. (40) [67] However, it is permissible to re-use  this vessel for salting once holes are made in it (41) [68] or even without holes if  meat has been salted and washed off. 
(42) But if it has holes [69] it is permissible to eat boiling hot food from it, and there are some that forbid boiling hot [70]One should be careful  initially (43) but post facto, it is permitted. 
Meat [71] that was salted in a vessel without holes [72] and was left for as  long as it takes for water to begin boiling is subject to the following rules:  Anything in the tzir is forbidden even for roasting, and what is outside the  tzir is not forbidden [73] expect for a klipah’s worth, even if it is fatty.  Rema: (44) [74] Some forbid the entire piece, even that which is outside  the tzir, even if only salted slightly as is done in preparation for roasting  [75] and even if it was not left for the required salting time rather only for a  little while allowing for tzir to be seen [76] this is the custom, and it should  not be changed. Nevertheless, only the actual piece that is touching the  tzir is forbidden (45) [77] but the other pieces that are upon it and salted  with it are permitted, and this is indeed the custom. 
After meat has been salted and washed, it may even be placed in water that is not boiling [78] and there are those that require it to be placed in boiling water. Rema: The custom is to follow the first opinion. 
Meat that was salted for as long as required and then placed in a vessel without holes without being washed off [79] and then filled up with tzir is permitted. (46) According to this, meat that fell into tzir that came out of the meat (47) after the required salting time is permitted. There are those who forbid it no matter what, and they should be followed initially. Rema: [80] And some forbid even post facto (48) [81] a klipah and this is the custom, regarding that which is in the tzir. However, anything outside the tzir is permitted. (49) [82] The vessel into which the tzir fell is forbidden, [83] Therefore if the vessel was dairy (50) and is dirty, the meat is forbidden since even after the salting time it is considered roseiach [84] however if it is a case of great loss and needed for a mitzvah (51) one may be lenient and say that once the required salting time has passed, it is no longer considered roseiach. (52) [85] According to his words even though meat sat in salt its required time, one may not eat it until it is washed off well. It is forbidden to cut it with a knife before it gets washed [86] and if cut, the knife must be kashered. Rema: [87] And some permit it to be cut with a knife after it went through it’s required salting time [88] for salt can not affect vessels [89] and it is indeed permitted [90] but the knife must be washed off [91] or thrusted into the ground if the tzir has already dried. Even if it is before the required salting time has passed (53) there is no prohibition on the knife, rather the problem is now that blood had come out from the meat to its surface, if one wants to now wash off that spot and go re-salt it one may do so. If one wants to then go and perform a salting in order to preserve the meat after it has been property salted for blood in a vessel with holes, [92] then the meat must be washed off well and re-salted. It may even be re-salted in a vessel without holes. If one wants [93] to salt meat and eat it roasted without washing one may do so and we are not worried about the blood that is on the salt, for the fire sucks out the blood and the salt can not absorb it. This is when it is salted and put on to be roasted, but if it sat in the salt, the salt absorbs blood, and the meat becomes forbidden. Therefore, it must be washed off well, then roasted, and then it may be eaten. See later on in section 76 regarding the law for meat that was salted without being washed off, and then roasted) 
In a place where salt is not easily found, one should roast the meat (54) until its blood has come out, and then one may cook it. 

Siman 70

One may salt many pieces, one on top of the other. Regardless of the fact that the the bottom piece finishes its excretions before the top one, we don't say that [the bottom piece] absorbs from the blood of the top one. This is because [the bottom piece] excretes gravy for a lengthy amount of time, and the entire time that gravy is emitted, [the piece] does not absorb. [This is true] even when much gravy gathers and stands inside of a depression between the pieces of meat - it is permitted. In what case is this dealing? In a case when he salts meat on meat, and even ox meat with kid or lamb meat, and even with chicken - [because] it is impossible for them to finish all the excretions of their gravy before the ox meat finishes excreting its blood. {RMA - in any event, we are accustomed to being strict in the first instance, that each piece which has a depression, as in [the case of] of a complete side of meat, to turn it over, in order that the blood should run off. However, one must not worry post factum. A piece which was salted twice is permitted - we don't worry that the secondary salt causes the blood from the first salting to be reabsorbed.} However, meat with fish, even chicken with fish, is forbidden to salt together. This is because the fish ceases excreting all of its gravy before the chicken finishes excreting its blood. If one did salt fish and chicken together, the chicken is permitted but one must take a peeling off the fish. However, if the scales were not removed when it was salted, it is permitted. {RMA - and there are those who forbid the entire fish [not just a peeling] if there wasn't 60 times [the volume] of the chicken, as we estimate in salting 60 times the volume, and such is the custom. And this is specifically referring to an instance where the scales weren't present, as fish skin is a soft membrane and excretes immediately. However, where the scales were present, it is permitted, as they do not excrete [all of their fluids] immediately and [thus] do not absorb from the chickens, because the entire time that they are busy excreting, they will not absorb, as we say about two pieces which were salted together.
In which cases is this said? When they were salted together, or if the  poultry was salted and the fish was not. (4) However if the fish is salty and  the poultry is not and they were placed beside each other [6] or on top of  each other, even the fish is permitted without removing a klipah. <i>Rema: (5)  [8] And so too if the fish [9] are placed on the poultry </i>they are permitted  even if they were salted together since the blood does not flow from  bottom to top, and it is no worse then a piece placed in the tzir in which  what is protruding from the tzir is permitted. If the fish were placed beside  the poultry [11] only (6) after the [12] poultry lay in their salt for the required  salting time, then even the fish are permitted even though they are both  salty. [13] If fish were salted in a vessel in which meat was salted, the fish  are permitted (7) for the fish do not absorb the blood in the vessel because  the salting has no effect on a vessel [14] That which we say that the fish  are forbidden if salty and the poultry is salty, is only when the fish [15] had  released all of their blood and have been washed, (8) but if they still did  not release their blood and were never salted, they are permitted because  when they release their own blood, they will release the blood they  absorbed from the poultry just like a piece that fell into tzir before being  salted. It is permitted for this reason as will be explained below. [16] See  further in section 91 regarding which salting is considered as roseiach.   
(9) Kosher meat that was salted with non-kosher meat, or non-kosher  meat that is salty with kosher meat that is not salty, [17] require the  removal of a klipah if they are touching [18] because even though it does  not absorb from the non-kosher blood, it absorbs from it’s tzir. However, if  the kosher meat is salted and the non-kosher meat is non-salty then it is  permitted even without removing a klipah as long as it is washed. This is  true whether the kosher piece is on the top or on the bottom. (10) There  are those who forbid it if they touch ,[19] and rule that the meat is not  permitted even if they were merely standing close to each other if it  allowed for their juices to touch. Rema: When the non-kosher meat is salty  and the kosher one is not-salty it is still forbidden. [20] See later in section  105 regarding these laws.   
(11) That in which we say that it is only forbidden to the extent of a klipah  is dealing with cases where the pieces of meat are lean. However if one of  them is fatty, [21] even if the non-kosher piece is lean and the kosher  piece is fatty, the forbidden juice spreads throughout the meat [22] if the  non-kosher salty piece was on the bottom. This is based on the rules of  tatai gavar. [23] See later on in section 105 how one should act.   
[24] There are those who say that meat that was salted is forbidden to  remain sitting in the salt after all its tzir has been released, which is after  twelve hours. This is because it begins to absorb from the drops of blood  that are upon it and on the salt, (12) There are also those that permit it to  lay in its salt for even several days. Initially one should follow the stricter  opinion. (12) but post facto it is permitted.   
There are those who forbid placing meat [25] that was not salted at all, [26]  or that was salted and had released all of its blood, with already salted  meat prior to its releasing of its blood. This is because the meat that wasn’t  salted or that was salted and had already released all of its blood now  absorbs what the other piece releases. [27] There are those who permit it  if another salting will take place later since then it will release all of this  newly absorbed blood. (14) [28] And there are those who permit it in any  case. [29] Initially one should follow the stricter opinion. Rema: (15) [30]  Even post-facto we customarily forbid meat [31] that has released all of its  blood and tzir and fell into meat that still did not complete the required  salting time. Some say that meat can release tzir for an entire twenty four  hour period after being salted. (16) [32] If during this time it touched meat  that had not completed the required salting time period, the meat is not  forbidden, and this is indeed the custom. [33] However, if there is no great  loss it should be forbidden if it is after 12 hours, but before this time one  need not be stringent at all, and surely if it had not been salted yet for even  if it had fallen into actual tzir it wouldn’t be forbidden for we say [34] that  when it releases it’s own blood, it will release anything else that it could  have absorbed. Even if the meat has been salted but has not sat for the  required salting time and fell into tzir [35] it may be permitted,[36] if it did  not sit in the tzir for an entire day. [37] If it had sat for the entire salting time  and then fell into tzir, some forbid it even though the releasing of tzir has  not been completed. Nevertheless, in a case of great loss it may be  permitted during the entire time that the meat releases tzir [38] which is  twelve hours [39] if it is re-washed and salted. [40] If it fell into tzir [41]  before the end of the required salting period re-wash and re-salt it. (18)  [42] However, if it was salted without being washed after it had fallen into  tzir [43] it is permitted post facto. All these cases are referring to tzir that  has the status of roseiach as explained in section 69. but blood (dam  b’eyn) that fell on meat [44] during the salting period that is considered  roseiach as explained later on in section 91, causes the meat to be  forbidden, for regarding this blood we don’t say that since the meat is now  in the process of releasing blood, it will release this blood as well, nor do  we say that “as it absorbed so will it release." (19) Regarding the case in  which we forbid it when it fell into tzir is only true for the part that is actually  in the tzir [45] but whatever is protruding from the tzir is permitted, [46]  however (20) what is in the tzir becomes forbidden immediately. Meat that  fell into tzir that is on the ground [47] is as if it was in a vessel without  holes. Meat that touched a piece that was salted in a vessel without holes  and became forbidden [48] has the same law as if it had touched tzir. In a  case of doubt of water or tzir, it is permitted, [49] for tzir is of rabbinical  origin so in a case of doubt we are lenient. Tzir mixed with water, [50] even  with only a little water, is no longer considered roseiach and cannot cause  meat to become forbidden. For the laws of soaking see section 105.   

Siman 71

[1] The head (1) is cut into two pieces and salted well on the inner side, [2] and is salted on its hair, for the hair is not a blockage from allowing blood to be released by the salt. 
(2) [3] The hooves are slightly slit at the bottom, salted, and laid out so the slit is face down. The hair is also salted. [4j See earlier section 68. 
The membrane surrounding the brain has many veins, and the brain itself  has much blood which will not come out through simply salting the head,  because the skull is blocking it, not allowing for the blood to flow.  Therefore, one who wants to salt it must cut the skull and remove the  brain, cut the surrounding membrane and salt it. [5] If one wants to salt the  head with the brain inside, then a hole must be pierced throughout the  skull and membrane, salt it, and place the hole face down as to allow the  blood to flow. It is then permitted even to be cooked. Rema: [6] And see  earlier in section 68 how one should act initially. If one salted the whole  head without making a hole in the skull then the [7] membrane and skull are forbidden, (3) [8] but the head is permitted along with any other meat  that is with it. The thigh bone, as well as other bones that have marrow  inside of them [9] must be salted [10] and the salting of the bone suffices  for the marrow as well. The bone need not be pierced. [11] Nevertheless,  ideally one should not salt it along with other meat, only alone. Post facto it  is permitted.   

Siman 72

The heart has much blood that gathered in it at the time of slaughtering. Therefore, it must be cut before salting to remove its blood, and can then be salted. <i>[1] It may then even be cooked. (1) [2] Some are stringent regarding cooking it, and only roast it. </i>Then it may be cooked. 
If one salted it without having cut it open (2) then it is to be cut  open after its salting, and is still permitted although it was salted  while the blood was gathered inside of it [3] because “as it  absorbed, so will it release.” It is also the case if it was roasted  without having been cut open, that it should be cut after the  roasting, and it will be permitted. (3) [4] However, if it was  cooked without having been opened it is forbidden [5] unless there  is sixty (4) against the heart, for we don’t know how much  escaped from it. Rema: [6] Even if there would be sixty, (5) [7/ the  heart itself remains forbidden [8] and a little bit should be sliced off  from anything surrounding the heart. There are those who rule  stringently even in a case of it having been salted. [9] and forbid  all meat that was salted with it for they say that we can not  assume the rule of "as it absorbed, so wilt it release” regarding  blood gathered within it. (6) This is because of the actual blood  and not simply blood that was released from it. (7) [10] The  custom however is to be lenient, and we rule that this blood is  considered blood that was released and it is possible to say that  ׳׳as it absorbed so will it release” since it was blood of the veins,  as was explained earlier in section 22. There are those who are  stringent and rule that a piece must be peeled from the place the  heart was touching. [ 11] It is proper to heed to their words and to peel a bit from anything that was around the heart, making  everything permitted, [12] There is no difference between meat  that is with the heart, or the heart itself. [13] There is also no  difference (8) whether the heart was closed or open at the top. It is  customary to cut the foreskin of the heart and to cut the sinews  inside of it. [14] However this is only a stringency and an act of  precaution.   
[15] There is no bird (such as a chicken, etc.) that wouldn’t have [16] sixty  against its heart, and it is permitted even if it was attached to the bird.  Rema: Every bird has sixty (9) even if its head and bottom feet have been  removed, as is customary to remove them until the lower knee. Therefore if  the bird is whole, everything is permitted. If it is not whole and it is lacking  sixty against the heart that is attached (10) [18] some say that the piece  becomes as ‘nveilah', and now sixty is required from the other items in the  pot against the whole bird, and this is indeed the custom. Even if there is sixty in the pot, the bird itself remains forbidden for it doesn’t have sixty  against the heart that is still attached. If the heart is not attached to the  bird, then everything in the pot can combine to achieve sixty against the  heart. See later in section 92 regarding the laws of a piece that becomes  nveilah. [19] There isn't an animal that has sixty against it’s heart.   
The lungs need not be cut open, [20] however it is customary to do so, and  to open its large tubes. It is indeed a good custom.   

Siman 73

The liver contains a lot of blood.
If it was boiled in vinegar, or in water, and a hole was made in it and blood  that shot from it was removed, according to the halacha it would be  permissible to cook it, but the sages forbade it. [10] Post facto it is  permitted.   
It must be cut in preparation for roasting due to the blood in the vessels. If  it was not cut during roasting, [11] it may be cut afterwards. Rema: Some  say that for roasting a cut need not be made (5) and this is our practice,  even initially.   
If it was roasted with meat in an oven such as the type that were common  in the days of the Talmudic sages whose mouth faced upwards, then the  liver should be placed on the bottom, and not on top, [12] however post  facto, it is permitted.[13] Regarding the skewers that are roasted on the  fire, it is forbidden to roast it initially with meat even if the liver is on the  bottom. Rema: Nevertheless, if the liver had been salted, it is permitted to roast it with meat, (6) [14] even on top of meat, since its blood has been  reduced, and is considered as any other piece of meat placed on another  piece of meat.   
[15] Initially it should not be salted on top of other meat, rather under it.  Rema: [16] It is customary (7) not to salt the liver at all, even alone, and  this is the custom and it should not be changed. It should only be lightly  salted when put on the skewer or when placed on the fire for roasting.  Nevertheless, if it is found that the liver was salted, whether alone or with  other meat, even if on top of the meat, everything remains permitted.  Some say that a slice should be cut from around the liver [17] if it is  attached to poultry, and this is only a stringency. [18] It is customary to  wash off every liver after being roasted because of the blood stuck to its  surface, [19] however if it wasn’t washed, it is still permitted.   
If a liver is found in an already roasted poultry, it is permitted. Rema: [20] Some say that a klipah should be removed from the area of the liver, [21]  but it is only a stringency. [22] If it was cooked, then you need sixty against  the liver. Rema: There is no whole poultry that would total sixty times its  liver. Therefore if the liver is whole and attached to the poultry, the poultry  becomes nveilah, and now sixty is needed against the entire poultry to  permit everything else in the pot. The same is true if you have a piece of  liver attached to a piece of poultry, for we have established that in all  forbidden items chaticha na’asis nveilah as is later in section 92. If the liver  is not attached then everything in the pot combines to nullify the liver, and  if there is sixty, everything is permitted. (8) [23] Nevertheless the liver itself  is forbidden just like the heart as is explained later in section 72. (9) Poultry  that was stuffed with eggs [24] and the heart or liver is found, is as if it was  cooked [24] and we require sixty from the poultry excluding the stuffing. If  there isn’t then everything is forbidden. [26] If it was stuffed with meat and  there are not any eggs that have been congealed and are blocking the  blood from flowing is subject to the rules as if it was roasted. 

Siman 74

(1) The spleen, although appearing red with a seemingly extensive amount  of blood. [1 ] is as any other meat and must be salted. Rema: Some say  that the custom [2] is not to cook the kidneys or [3] testicles even after  nikkur, since they contain so much blood, but post facto, one need not  worry. [4] It is permitted to salt all these with other meat, even though they  contain much blood, [5] as long as the membrane and fats from them have  been removed.   

Siman 75

Blood is not assumed to be in the intestines (1) [1] such as in the paunch  and the maw [2] and the bowels and the rectum (meaning the intestinal  tube which is at the top of the anus), if they are without fat on them.  Therefore if they were cooked in a pot without having been salted, they are  permitted [3] unless they have a blush red appearance. Rema: And if they  were salted in a vessel that does not have any holes, they are permitted.  (2) [5] Nevertheless, initially they require salting in a vessel with holes and  a preliminary washing as any other meat. Some disagree regarding the  paunch and say that it does contain blood, [6] even post facto the paunch  and reticulum of the ruminant stomach is forbidden as any other meat.  However the fat that is upon them is as any other meat. Therefore when  the rectum and other intestines are salted [7] they are not salted on the  inner part over the actual food, (3) rather on the outside where the fat is  attached. Rema: If the rectum was salted on the inner side and not on the  outer side it is as if it wasn’t salted. [8] if it was cooked this way it is not  kosher [9] if it has fat on the outside. If it wasn’t cooked yet (4) [10] go back  and salt the outer part [11] and it is then permitted. Eggs that are found in  poultry after being slaughtered if only the yolk was formed but not the white  part of the egg, then it must be salted as any other meat. (5) [12] and it  may be salted with other meat, if even the white part has been formed,  even if the shell on it is as hard as the shell on eggs which are sold in the  market, it is customary to salt it. However one must be careful not to salt it  with other meat, put post facto one need not worry. All fat, even of poultry  is considered as all other meat for the purposes of salting and washing. 
Intestines without fat on them, even though not containing blood (6) [13]  may be salted with other meat. Rema: Some forbid them to be salted with  other meat (7) and this is initially how one should act, however post facto it  is permitted.   
The fat of the winding coil that is on the bowel is full of vessels containing  blood. Therefore some forbid it to be cooked, even if cut and salted, but  now we customarily permit it. Those blood vessels, which if someone is  expert in, may be stretched and properly hung until not even one remains.   

Siman 76

[1] Meat that is to be roasted need not be salted [2] since the fire will draw  out the blood that is in it by itself. [3] However, if other blood had dripped  on the grill, [4] even if it’s cold we do not say that the fire will draw it out, (1)  [5] and it causes the meat to become forbidden to the depth of a netilah.   
If one wishes to salt the meat before roasting it (2) [6] and eat it without  washing it, one may do so and we are not worried about the blood  remaining on the salt. Some say this ruling refers to one who salted it, and  then immediately roasted it, (3) but if it lay in the salt (4) the salt absorbs  and is forbidden. [7] Therefore it should be well washed before the  roasting. Rema: [8] Some say that roasting requires a preliminary washing  (Ramban), and some say that it requires a slight salting beforehand as well  (Rashi). The custom is to wash it first and then to lightly salt it when it is on  the skewer, and to then immediately roast it so that the salt will not absorb  blood. [9] Nevertheless, if it wasn’t washed or salted at all, or it was salted  without having been washed first, and then roasted, it is still permitted.  This is only if it did not sit idle in the salt (5) without being washed for the  entire salting period, but if it did indeed lay idle for this amount of time  before being roasted, it is forbidden. [10] There is no difference in all this  (6) between geese, or other birds with open cavities [11] as long as they  are not stuffed with eggs or other meat. If they are stuffed they are subject  to the same rules as have being cooked, and require salting just as any  other meat to be cooked. It is customary to act stringently when roasting  meat that has not been salted [12] and to refrain from always flipping over  the skewer so that the blood will flow, but post facto, one need not worry.  In makes no difference in all this if one wishes to eat after roasting, or if  one wishes to cook it afterwards. [13] It simply must be roasted first to the point that it is fit to be eaten [14] which is about half it’s possible roasting.  Some say [ 15] that all roasting requires a washing after being roasted  because of the blood that is stuck to it. and this is the custom in the first  instance. Nevertheless, it if wasn't washed and even if it was cooked, it is  permitted. This is true even if it was first salted before being roasted and  not washed after the salting that it is permitted. We are not worried about  the blood that is upon it, for the fire draws it out.   
[16] If the jugular vein of poultry was not pierced during the slaughtering  then it is forbidden to eat it, even if roasted, unless it is cut limb by limb and  roasted. [17] If one wished to eat it raw, it is forbidden until it is cut and  salted. If the meat was cleaned from its veins of blood, it may be eaten raw  even without being salted, [18] or roasted, even all of it at once. [19] There  are those who rule stringently that it should not be eaten all at once even if  roasted (8) [20] until the jugular vein and the majority of the two required  tubes have been but.   
There is one who forbids the cutting of roasted meat with a knife that is  beside the fire if it wasn't salted, so long as it hasn't been fully roasted  because of the blood that gets absorbed into the knife. [21] There is also  one who forbids the skewer that was used for roasting meat that wasn't  salted. There is also one who ruled that it is forbidden to leave roasted  meat on the skewer [22] after it is removed from the fire (9) after the flow  from the meat had concluded, for fear that the hot meat will now re-absorb  it. There are those who permit all the above situations, and it is indeed the  custom to permit it. [23] We are careful in the first instance (10) but post  facto it is permitted.   
Roasted meat that was not first salted, and was cut over a loaf of bread  [24] does not cause the bread to become forbidden, even if it appears red,  as long as the meat was roasted to the point of being edible to most  people. That is, half its time. The same is true regarding the red juice that  flows out of the meat.   
(11) [25] Meat that is roasting without first having been salted should not  have a vessel be placed below it in order to catch the fats that are dripping  off it, until it has been roasted to the point that it can be eaten.   

Siman 77

Poultry or goats that are filled with meat that was not salted are permitted if  they are roasted, even if the mouth is facing upwards (1) [1] and even if the  outer part was salted (2) for as it absorbs blood from the filling so will it  release. Rema: [2] Of course if the inner part was salted and not the outer  part it is permitted as well, for the flame draws out blood from the outside  without it being absorbed in the inside. For cooking, it is forbidden [3] until  salting (3) is performed on the outside on its own and in the inside on its  own. !f after it was stuffed the outside was salted (4) [4] it does not release  blood from the inner side. Rema: All this is post facto, but in the first  instance one should not stuff anything until both are salted. [5] This is all  referring to a case that the stuffing is meat or herbs, however if there are  congealed eggs it is as if cooked in a pot. [6] Even post facto it should be  ruled as forbidden (5) if they were both not salted. Meat that was not  washed or salted that was roasted with meat that was washed and salted  is permitted post facto. In the first instance it is forbidden to roast meat that  was salted with meat that was not salted even if it was washed.   

Siman 78

[1] If one places dough on poultry that was not salted, although the Gemara differentiates between coarse flour and other flour, and between it appearing red and not we are not expert in these rules therefore we should forbid it in every׳ case. Nevertheless if it was properly salted and washed it is permitted in all cases. Rema: Only placing dough on it is forbidden, but to smear it with oil is permitted, (1) or with the juice from meat that was not salted, for this will not block the release of blood. [2] A quiche has all the same rules as food that is to be cooked (2) with its leniencies and stringenies.

It is written in the Torah: "you will not cook a kid in the milk of its mother" three times (Exodus 23:19 /Exodus 34:26, Deuteronomy 14:21); once for the prohibition of Cooking, once for the prohibition of eating, and once for the prohibition of receiving benefit [from the cooked meat and milk products]. Eating is derived from the language of cooking, saying that there is no prohibition from the torah [in regard to meat and milk] unless its in a manner of cooking, but rabbinically it [the mixture of meat and milk] is forbidden in every way. All meat and milk [mixtures] that are not forbidden from the torah [through a way of cooking] is permitted to benefit from.
[the word] "kid", is not specific, it is the rule with a Ox, sheep and goat. It does not matter [if the kid is cooked] in the milk of its mother, and it does not matter if its in the milk of another [domesticated animal], it is but the language of the verse.
Only custom is with meat from a pure [kosher] animal and milk from a pure animal, but meat of a pure animal in milk tha is impure, or meat from a impure animal and pure milk, is permitted to cook an get benefit from it. Meat of a wild animal and of chicken,even in milk which is pure, is permitted cook and benefit; and even eating is not prohibited, its only prohibited rabinically. Rema: its a custom to make milk from almonds and place in it chicken meat, since it not even a prohibition from the rabbis. but meat from a domesticated animal there is [to be strict] to place it next to almond milk, b/c it looks like its an issur, it is explained earlier on in siman 66 for the matter of blood.  
it is forbidden to cook [meat] with milk of a woman, because it seems like the prohibition itself. if it [happens that milk of a woman] fell into the mixture being cooked, it is nullified and there is no need to measure [to see if the milk is null and void by being less than one sixtieth in the contrast to the meat]: REMA: It seems according to this, all the more so that it is forbidden to cook, with intention to do so, with impure milk or impure meat with pure milk  and  [this] is specifically with meat of domesticated animals but with chicken, that is a rabbinical prohibition and there is no need to be concerned. 
Eggs that are found inside chickens, if they are complete that they have egg white and yolk, even though that it is bound with sinews [from the chicken], indeed it is complete and it is permissible to eat it with milk but if the egg does not have egg white and yolk, it is forbidden to cook with milk but if he eats them before them [the dairy products] it is permissible to eat afterwards cheese and milk.

(Non-hot) Meat and cheese that touched each other are both permissible to be eaten, providing that you first rinse off the spot on each where they touched.  It is permissible to wrap them both in one napkin (or wrap), and not be worried lest they touch.
anything that requires rinsing, and you put cold meat on a non kosher plate which is cold, letachila maybe you shouldn't do because its not clean, you have to make sure its clean because you don't rinse (bhadacha) your cold cuts before you eat them.......rama: if you are dealing with something that isn't moist but is dry, then you can put it on the plate and you have nothing to worry about. 
you have to be careful the the meat doesn't touch bread because if it touches it you cant eat it with cheese and visa versa.....
meat and milk that are boiling and are mixed together , and even cold meat that enters boiling milk or visa versa, it is not allowed from rabbinic science because it spreads- but boiling milk that fell on cold meat or visa versa, you take out (peel off) the bad part and the rest is allowed. (if all you did was washing it and cooking it without peeling off the peel is batal besheeshem so its okay-bedeved-after the fact its okay and is allowed)

Siman 92

An olive-worth of meat that falls into a pot of boiling milk: let a non-Jew taste the dish. If he says that there is a taste of meat in it, it is forbidden. If not, it [the milk] is permitted, even in less than sixty, and that piece [the meat] is forbidden.  When is this true?  When one quickly removes the piece before it exudes the milk that it absorbed, meaning before the pot rests from its boiling.  But if he didn't remove it before it was able to exude the milk it absorbed, even if a non Jew tastes it and it has no taste at all, (rama) it's forbidden unless there is sixty.  <i>See chapter 98 (Shulchan Arukh, Yoreh De'ah 98) that we aren't accustomed to rely on the tasting of a non-Jew and we need sixty every time.</i> 
Milk falls into a pot of meat: [let a non-Jew] taste the piece that the milk fell on.  If it does not taste of milk, everything is permitted.  If the piece does taste of milk, then that piece is forbidden. <i>For us who don't rely on a non-Jew, we need sixty in the piece, and if there's not sixty then it's all forbidden.</i> And we measure it [the original piece of meat] against the whole [pot].  If there was in all that is in the pot, the pieces, the vegetables, the soup, and the spices, enough that this piece is one in sixty [or less] of the whole, the piece is forbidden and the rest is permitted.  In what situation are we speaking? When the pot was not stirred at the beginning when the milk  fell in, but only at the end, and the pot wasn't covered.  But if it was stirred from beginning until end or was covered from the time of [milk] falling in until the end, everything joins together to nullify the taste of milk. <i>Therefore, if it wasn't stirred at all, not at the beginning and not at the end, and wasn't covered at all, if there is sixty in the pot compared to the drop of milk that fell in, it only prohibits the piece alone, and the rest of the pot is permitted (Bet Yosef in the name of the Ra'avid and Magid Mishnah in the name of the Rambam.) And also if it was stirred at the beginning or covered immediately even though it wasn't stirred or covered at the end, all of the pot joins together, if it was stirred or covered immediately when the prohibited matter fell in (Tur and Bet Yosef in the name of the Ri N Haviv.)</i>  Therefore, if [the milk] fell into the soup or onto a piece and we don't know onto which piece it fell, stir the whole pot until it's all mixed.  If in the whole pot there is a taste of milk, it's prohibited, and if not, it's permitted.  And if there is no non-Jew to taste and be relied on, we measure with sixty (until now, the language of the Rambam.)  <i>There are those who disagree and reason that stirring the pot isn't effective unless it's stirred immediately after the prohibited matter fell in, and this is our practice.</i>   
When a piece of meat becomes forbidden due to milk it is prohibited completely. If it was cooked with others, sixty is needed to negate it all. If you recognize it, take it out and the others are acceptable. If you don't recognize it, the sauce is permitted but all the pieces of meat are forbidden if the initial piece was roeeya latchabel (too important to be considered part of a mixture)

The sages forbade eating the bread of idol worshippers because of the concern of intermarriage. Rema: and even in a situation where there is no concern of intermarriage, it is [nonetheless] forbidden. (Rashb"a §248) However, they only forbade bread made from the Five Grains (wheat, barley, oats, rye, spelt), but bread made from legumes or from rice or millet is not in the category of "regular bread" which they forbade. Rema: It is also not forbidden on account of [being] "Idolaters' Cooking," if it would not be served at kings' tables (Tur and Beit Yosef in the name of the Rosh's responsa).
There are places that are lenient about this, [where] they buy bread from an idolater's bakery in a situation where there is no Jewish bakery, since this is considered a "time of pressing need." Rem"a: And some say that even in a place where "Jews' bread" can be found, it is permitted (Beit Yosef following the Mordechai; Sefer Mitzvot Hakatan; Hagaot Ashri; Mahar"i; Issur VeHeter §44). But regarding personal bread, no-one rules leniently, since the essence of the decree is because of the concern of intermarriage, and if one eats the bread of [idolatrous] home-owners, he will come to dine by them. Rem"a: However, it is not called "personal bread" unless he made it for the people of his own household, but if he made it to sell, it is called commercial bread, even if he doesn't normally [sell bread]; conversely, a baker who made [bread] for himself, it is considered "personal [bread]."

Siman 113

A food that is not eaten when it is raw and is served at a kings table, to spread on bread or as a dessert, which was cooked by a non-Jew, even in the pots of Jews and in the house of a Jew, it is forbidden because it was cooked by a non-Jew
If one mixed a food that is eaten even raw with a thing that is eaten when raw and a non-Jew cooked them – if the essence is of the food is subject to the prohibition of non-Jewish cooking, it is forbidden. If not, it is permitted. Rema: And it is permitted to eat roasted peas of a non-Jew, and also the roasted legumes (which are called “arbiss”), for they are not served at the kings table And thus they treat them leniently if it is not in a place where they grease the metal frying pan with forbidden fats, then the custom is that they are prohibited. But otherwise it is permitted, and one need not worry about the vessels of non-Jews because most vessels have not been used in the last 24 hours. And any fruit that is eaten raw, even if a non-Jew cooked it, and it was mashed up and made into a cooked dish in their hands, it is permitted. Therefore, we eat the fruit mash made by non-Jews.
Pot pies that are baked by a non-Jew are forbidden, even for those who are accustomed to be lenient on non-Jewish bread, because the fats and oils are forbidden when readily apparent as they are subject to the prohibition of non-Jewish cooking, and they are absorbed within the bread. And so vegetables that are eaten raw but cooked with meat are forbidden because the fat of the meat has been absorbed within them.
There are those that permit cooking by our non-Jewish maids, and those that forbid, and even after the fact. Rema: And after the fact, you should rely on those that permit. And even initially, we are accustomed to be lenient with a Jewish house that has non-Jewish maidservants and menservants that cook in the Jewish house, because it is impossible that no one in the house would protest even a little if they were to cook incorrectly.
Non-Jews that cook, and do not intend to cook, this is permitted. How? A non-Jew that lights a fire in a swamp in order to chase away the locusts, and some of those locusts become cooked, these are permitted, even in a place where they are served on a kings table. And thus if he singed the head of an animal, it is permitted to eat the tips of the ears that became roasted at the time of the singeing. But if the non-Jew intended to cook, for example that he lit the oven to cook in it, and there was some meat in there already which became roasted, even though he did not intend to cook the meat, as he did not know it was there, it is forbidden.
Anything which a Jew cooks to some small degree, whether at the beginning or the end of the cooking, is permitted. Therefore, if the non-Jew placed meat or a dish on the fire, and the Jew flipped the meat and stirred the dish, or he stirred it, and the non-Jew finished cooking, this is permitted. (And even if the dish couldn't be cooked without the non-Jew).
If the fie of the oven was only lit sufficiently for bread, but not for other things, this is not considered a lit oven, and fires are not considered lit unless they are at the specific needed temperature. Therefore, if one wants to cook in a pan in an oven of non-Jews, it is necessary that the Jew puts the pan in himself, to a place in the oven that is appropriate to cook in. Rema: And there are those that disagree and believe that lighting a fire or stoking the coals in any way with regards to cooking, as with bread, is sufficient, and that is our custom. And even stoking the fire without any particular intentions works. And there are those that say that even if the Jew did not stoke the fire, and did not throw in any wood chips, only that the non-Jew lit the oven from a fire that was lit by a Jew, that is permitted.
If a Jew puts the dish on the fire, and takes it off, and a non-Jew comes and puts the dish back on, this is forbidden. Unless the food had become at least one third cooked when it was removed from the fire.
If the non Jew cooks the food at least a third of the way, and then a Jew comes and finishes the cooking, there is a side to forbid it unless it is the Sabbath eve or the eve of a holiday or a great loss will occur. Rema: And there are those that permit it in any case, and such is our custom.
If a Jew places items on coals which are unable to cook them to a third, and a non-Jew comes and blows on the coals and they cook, the food is forbidden.
If a Jew places a dish on the fire, and has the non-Jew watch the dish, and he blows on it, but he doesn't know if the non-Jew removed the food before it was cooked to a third, it is permitted. Rema: And thus is the case in every instance of doubt regarding a non-Jew cooking and similar examples, that it is mutar.
Small fish that are salted by a Jew or non-Jew, salting is considered a small aspect of cooking. And if the non-Jew roasted them after, they are permitted. But large salted fish are not edible except in pressing circumstances. Therefore, if a non-Jew roasted them, they are forbidden, and there are those that permit this. Rema: And thus anything that is edible when raw only in pressing circumstances, and a non-Jew cooked them, the rule is like large fish. And meat that is salted is not edible at all when it is raw, and it is forbidden if it is cooked by a non-Jew.
Fish salted by a non-Jew and fruits that are smoked until they are fit to eat, these are permitted, because salting is not considered like boiling for the purposes of this injunction, and smoking is not like cooking. Rema: Also soaking is not like cooking, because the only prohibition is on cooking by fire.
Egg, even though it may be swallowed raw, if it is cooked by a non-Jew, is forbidden.
Dates that are a little bitter which are unable to be eaten except in pressing circumstances, if they are cooked by a non-Jew, they are forbidden.
Dishes in which a non-Jew has cooked things before on his own need to be made kosher. And there are those that say that this is not necessary. And even for those that require the dishes to be made kosher, if it is a clay vessel, it should be placed into boiling water three times, and that is sufficient, because there is nothing that is forbidden here according to the Torah. Rema: A non-Jew that cooks for someone who is sick on the sabbath, it is permitted after the sabbath, even for those who are healthy, and there is no concern here of the prohibition of non-Jewish cooking, because in any case, it is recognizable what this is.

Siman 114

Any alcoholic beverage of Gentiles, whether it be of dates or figs or of barley or of grain, or of honey, are forbidden because of intermarriage. And it is not forbidden except in the place of its sale, but if he brings the alcoholic beverage to his home, and drinks them there, it is allowed, since the essence of the decree is that perhaps he will dine with the Gentile. And the sages only forbid it when he has a set place for drinking as people are wont to do, but if he enters the house of a gentile and drinks there in a temporary manner, it is allowed. And so too one who stays overnight in the house of a gentile, it is thought of as his house, and one is allowed to send into the city to buy alcoholic beverages from the idol worshipers. Rama: And there are those who permit the alcoholic beverages of honey and grains, and it is the custom to be lenient in our countries.
A place in which Jews are accustomed to be lenient regarding the wine of non-Jews, even the beer is forbidden.
Apple wine, pomegranate wine, and anything like them, are allowed to be drunk in any location, because uncommon items were included in the decree.
All such drinks and so too the vinegar from them are forbidden to be purchased from them if their appearance is more desirable than wine, because we are concerned that perhaps they will mix some wine (until there is greater than 1/60th wine present which will not be nullified). What are we talking about? When one buys in a shop; but if he sees the shopkeeper bring it from the barrel, it is permitted, and we are not concerned that perhaps wine was mixed in, because if wine would be mixed inside the barrel, it would ruin the product. Rema: And even though that it is normal is to rub the inside of vats with lard, there is no concern as this gives off a ruined flavor, which is also nullified in 60, and also there is no concern that they would put wine in the drink. And see chapter 134 in a place that they are accustomed to put blood or other forbidden things into the salt, or ink, if it is permitted or forbidden.
Pomegranate wine that is purchased for it's healing properties, is permitted to be bought from the merchant, even if it is not from the barrel, even though that it has a superior appearance to that of wine, because since that people are careful about medicine, they will not want to risk their own careers over this. (and so too all things that are bought from craftsmen that they do not want to tarnish their careers)
One needs to be careful and to check alcohols and drinks made from honey that the non-Jew has just made them, if he placed in them wine yeast. Rema: And if it is normal to put yeast in, then it is forbidden to buy from them if the drink does not have at least 60 times the amount of yeast. And that is only if it does not contribute to the taste, for if it is for the taste it would not be nullified, even with 1000 times the amount of yeast.
Oil and honey of non-Jews are permitted, and they are not forbidden on account of the prohibition of non-Jewish cooking, and not because the non-Jews have altered it, and it is the same rule for their hot water.
Caperberries and Qaphlotos and Locusts that they cook, soaked they are permitted, and one that sees them remove it from storage, but they are buying them in the store, are forbidden as perhaps they have adulterated them with wine. And so olives that are soaked in brine are permitted, even if they are very soft as they are disgusting in their natural state, and we do not suspect that perhaps they have adulterated them with wine, and this is only if they do not cut them with their knives. Rema: Because after they have been soaked they are spicy and shall absorb flavors from the knife. But if they are soaked in non-Jewish containers, they are permitted because after they put water in them to nullify the spice. And so too with anything similar, and see above in chapter 96.
Grapes of non-Jews, even if they are very wet and have cracked, they are permitted. And so all soaked things that it is not their way to put wine or vinegar in them. And so too with kosher fish. And so too fish brine that has fish in it. And so too asafoetida is permitted.
It is forbidden to buy asafoetida from non-Jews if it is cut with their knives which have come into contact with non-kosher food, and so too with mixtures of fish, because small unkosher fish gets into the mixers and it is impossible to separate them, and they sometimes place wine to soak in the mixture. And this is forbidden to eat, but to benefit from it is permitted. And if it is known that they put wine in all of these, then they are forbidden even to benefit from. Rema: And you can sell them all, except if it has non-Jewish wine in it. And if it is known that a non-Jew will later be in a city where they do not mix wine, even though that other non-Jews are accustomed to do so, this is permitted to buy from them, as long as you don't know for certainty that they have mixed wine in, because we rely on this lenience that perhaps they have not mixed anything in. And so too for anything like this that is forbidden rabbinically. And if it is known with certainty that some non Jews mix wine in, and some do not mix wine in, then we go according to the majority, as it is unusually for a person to deviate from the norm. But it is forbidden to buy from them when they are at home, because one half is just like the other half in this regard.
Fish oil, in a place where it is common to add wine, is forbidden. And if wine is worth more than the fish, it is permitted. and in a place that it is not common to mix the two, it is permitted to purchase it, and to do this often, and to send to others by a non-Jew.
The Rashba was very careful regarding Saffron, because in every land there are counterfeiters who adulterate it with much wine and also mix in bits of dried meat.

Siman 115

Milk that was milked by non-Jews and no Jew saw them do so, it is forbidden as perhaps non-kosher milk was mixed in. If it was milked in his house and a Jew was sitting outside, if it is known that there is no non-kosher animal in his herd, it is permitted, even if no Jew is able to see him at the time that he milks the animal. If he has a non-kosher animal in his heard, and the Jew sits outside, and the non-Jew is milking only for the sake of the Jew, even if the Jew is unable to see him when he is sitting, if he is able to see him when he stands, this is permitted, because the non-Jew fears that perhaps he will stand and be seen, and he knows that non-kosher milk is forbidden the to Jew. Rema: Initially, it is necessary for the Jew to be there are the beginning of the milking and check to make sure that the bucket is empty and does not contain non-kosher milk. In any case, after the fact there is no need to be concerned for this. And regarding maidservants that milk domestic animals in the Jew's house or in his neighborhood are not, they are not suspected of milking non-kosher animals. But if a non-Jew takes a break, the Jew needs to be there, because it is like the case of the non-Jew's house. And even a Jewish child will suffice, because the non-Jew appears before him. In any case, if a Jew is not present until after he has finished milking, this milk is considered the milk of non-Jews that is forbidden, even thought no non-kosher animal exists in his herd. Milk of a non-Jew makes vessels non-kosher when they are cooked in them, just as any prohibited food, even though this is only an uncertainty whether he has mixed in something non-kosher. And so too with non-Jewish cheese, but not non-Jewish butter, even in a place where it is considered prohibited it does not prohibit vessels when cooked, and it is not a problem if it becomes mixed; if it is mixed in that which is permitted, everything is permitted, like above regarding the bread of non-Jews. See above in chapter 112. Milk of non-Jews that is forbidden, it will not work to make it into cheese or butter afterwards, rather it remains forbidden, and everything that is made from it is forbidden.
Cheese made by non Jews was forbidden because that they are produced with the dried stomach of an animal that was not correctly slaughtered. And even when the cheese is produced using vegetarian rennet it is forbidden. Rema: And thus is the custom, and it must not be changed, unless you are in a place that has permitted this since earlier times. And if a Jew oversees the production of the cheese and the milking, it is permitted. And thus is the custom that spread in all of our countries. And if a Jew oversaw the making of the cheese, but not the milking, it is permitted after the fact, because there is no concern that perhaps something non-kosher was mixed in after the cheese was made from the milk, because non-kosher milk will not allow the cheese to form, and of course the non-Jew did not mix anything in once he knew it was for making cheese. And in any case, it is forbidden to eat such milk.
Butter of non-Jews, there is no question that such a thing is permitted. And if the majority of a place treat it as forbidden, this cannot be changed. And in a place that has no particular custom, if the butter is cooked until the milk solids come out, this is permitted. Rema: Also it is permitted to cook it in this fashion initially in order to get the milk solids. And if a non-Jew cooked it, it is permitted, because most vessels have used in the past 24 hours. And if one goes from a place where this is not eaten, to a place where they do eat it, he should eat it with them, but it is forbidden to bring it with him and eat it in a place where they are accustomed to forbidding it. If the butter is not recognizable as being from such a place, it is permitted. And one who goes from a place where this is forbidden, to a place where it is permitted, it is forbidden to eat it there. And there are those that say that the law is the same if he brought it from a permissive place to a prohibitive place, that this is also forbidden, even if it is recognizable, and such is the custom.

Siman 116



Siman 117

Anything that is specifically for eating and Biblically prohibited, even though it is not forbidden to derive benefit from it, is forbidden to do business in it. Rema: Or to lend with it as collateral. And even to purchase it to feed it to one’s idol worshipping workers is forbidden. Except for Biblically prohibited fats because the Torah says in regard to it: “it may be used for all kind of work” (Lev. 7:24). And if impure wild animals or birds or fish happened into the trap of a trapper, Rema: Additionally one into whose house happened a nevelah or treifah, he is permitted to sell them, assuming that he did not intend for them to come into his possession in the first place. Rema: And he needs to sell them immediately and not to wait until they become fat in his possession. And it is also permitted to collect impure things from an idol worshipper for a debt because this is like rescuing [what is yours] from their possession. It is forbidden to sell an idol worshipper nevelah claiming that it is kosher. And anything that is only prohibited rabbinically, it is permitted to use it for commerce.

Siman 118

Wine or meat or a piece of fish that does not have on it a sign, which one deposits or sends with a non-Jew, it needs two seals. But cooked wine and beer or wine that has other things mixed in it such as honey, and so too vinegar, milk, brine, bread, and cheese and anything that is prohibited by the words of the scribes [i.e. rabbinically] that one deposits in the hand of a non-Jew, is permitted by a single seal. And there are those that say that even things which require two seals only require them when they are sent along with a non-Jew that is not able to see the second seal, but it is enough that he can see one, and he will be afraid to do anything to the product. And even the one who sends the package, if he informs his friend of the form of the seal, and also tells the non-Jew that he has informed his friend, then one seal is enough. Rema: There are those who say that we require two stamps only for a Jew who is suspected of wrongdoing, but for a non-Jew, everything is permitted, even by one seal, and after the fact one may rely upon this.
When the seals are appropriate, two seals on a thing that requires two, and one seal on that which requires one, you do not have to double check them. But if one double checks the seal and does not recognize it, it is forbidden even if two seals were made. Rema: And in any case, this is specifically if it is a thing which there is a concern that the product was switched, and it would benefit the courier to have switched it, or it is wine and there is a concerned that it has been touched. But if he saw the item that was sent, or he deposited it, and it is as good as when it was sent, and it would not have benefited the courier to have switched, we are not concerned, even if the seal was damaged. And see the end of chapter 134 regarding our countries....
One letter is considered to be one seal, two letters would be like two seals. And if they are printed, even though there are many letters, they are only considered to be a single seal, since that they are set with a single action. And there are those that say that in a place where many apostates are found or non-Jews who know how to write, then one should not write a sign except to someone who recognizes his handwriting.
A cap and a seal constitute two seals. But on things where one seal is sufficient, if you only have a cap, this is not considered a seal. Rema: If something is sent within a sack, and the sack is sealed, this is only considered a single seal, unless the package is sown closed inside. And if you sealed the item, and also sealed the sack, this is considered two seals.
If you send a thigh by a non-Jew without a seal, if it was sealed in a way that made it clear that a Jew has removed the sciatic nerve, this is kosher. And so all seals that are recognizable that a Jew has removed forbidden nerves, or anything like it. Rema: And so to with other pieces of meat that are with them, if there is a concern that perhaps they could be switched, they are forbidden. And this is specifically with regards to meat or other things which the Torah forbids, but if something that is only rabbincially forbidden was sent, like cheese which we suspect might be switched by the non-Jew, if it is recognizable in some small way that it was not switched, everything is permitted, if the package contains something better than that which was sent, then of course if it was switched he would have had to have bought the better product.
If you send an animal or a bird with a non-Jew, but they lack a seal, they are forbidden, because indications of ritual slaughter is not considered a sufficient mark that we can rely on.
If a package was sent with a non-Jew, and it was sent through a public place, this is permitted, because he will be concerned that perhaps someone will see him in public and report him for being a thief. And in any case, initially you should not send anything by a non-Jew without a seal.
One who buys meat and sends it by someone who does not know the laws, he is to be trusted regarding it, even though that he is not careful about kosher, and we do not suspect him of switching anything. And even by a Jew's manservant or a maidservant, they are believed in this matter. And there are those that say that if it is a Jew who is suspected of wrongdoing for eating things that people are not lenient regarding, even he is suspected of switching.
Meat that is found in the hands of the non-Jew, and it has a seal or has "kosher" written on it, even though that the non-Jew doesn't understand what is written there, it is kosher, because it makes it known that a Jew originally made this. And this is where non-Jews do not know how to write. Rema: And so it is permitted to buy cheese sealed as the Jews seal them. And specifically in a place where there is no concern that perhaps some sort of stamp is in the hands of the non-Jew that he could have stamped his own cheese. And there are those that forbid all of this, since that it is not known who wrote the letter or made the stamp, and after the fact we are not stringent about this.
One who leaves a non-Jew alone in his house, and inside there are things that could be switched, and they would be then forbidden by the Torah, if he goes out and [re-]enters or even if he waited a long time and did not inform him that he intends to wait, it is permitted, and we do not worry that perhaps he switched it, even if he will benefit from switching the product, and this is provided that he does not lock his house up. Because he is afraid the entire time, saying, “Now he will return and he will see me.” But if he informed that he intended to wait, it is forbidden. But if he will not benefit from the switch, it is permitted in any case, for we are not concerned that perhapse he will switch them and cause the owner to stumble, since he gains no benefit from this matter.
A Jew and a non-Jew that share together two pots, one by the other, this one for kosher meat, this one for non-kosher meat, this is permitted, and we are not concerned that perhaps when the Jew returns, the non-Jew will have switched kosher and non-kosher , even if the Jew's meat is better, and even if he vocalizes that it is better, it is permitted, and we are not concerned that perhaps they will splash and spill into one another. And this same rule is true for two things that are roasted next to each other. But initially, we should be careful even with two pots.
One should be stringent not to leave a pot with a maidservant when no Jew is in the house. Rema: And you should not even leave and reenter. And if damage occurred that something forbidden was placed in the pot, you should not eat from the pot, so this should not become a regular occurrence.
A Jew that made cheeses in a non-Jew's house, and sealed it with a seal that is made by a wooden stamp, and he forgets the stamp in the house of the non-Jew, there is no concern that perhaps the seal was counterfeited by the non-Jew, and he stamped other things with the stamp. And so there is no concern that perhaps the non-Jew smeared the cheeses with lard. Rema: And there are those that say that we should not permit it if he forgot the stamp in the house of the non-Jew, unless he left it on the cheese that he himself made, but if he left it like so, and there is a concern that perhaps the non-Jew cut the cheese smaller, and then switched it with another large piece of cheese or something better, it is forbidden. And in a situation of loss, we should be lenient in any case.

Siman 119

A Jew who is suspected of eating forbidden things, whether he is suspected of something forbidden by the Torah or something forbidden by the rabbis, one may not rely on his word. And if one is a house-guest with him, he may not eat from his foods for which he is suspected. Rema: And there are those who say that even for someone who is not suspected, but rather that we merely do not know him to be established regarding keeping kosher, it is forbidden to buy from him wine or other things for which there is a concern about prohibited items. In any case, if one is a house-guest with him, he may eat with him.
If one is not suspected to eat forbidden things, but is his suspected to sell them, one whom is a house-guest by him may eat with him. And thus if he sends food to your house, it is permitted, because it is persumed that he would not eat something strange to him, and someone who succumbs to temptation is not considered suspect.
One may give his food to the one who is suspected of eating non-kosher items in order that he should fix or cook them, and there is no concern that he will switch them, since he is not suspected of outright robbery. And if it is given to someone who is zealous about his actions, and he is suspected of eating non-kosher, it is forbidden, as perhaps he will damage what he was given and then switch it out with his own food. How? If one gives something to his father in law who is suspected regarding forbidden things, it is forbidden, because of the shame of marriage, and he wants to make his daughter look good, and therefore he will switch out something bad with something good. And thus if one gives something to an innkeeper who is suspect, sometimes he is embarrassed of his guest and will switch something bad for something good. (And in any case, it is permitted to deposit items with him and they should be in the same state as when they were deposited).
One who is suspected for one thing is not suspected for other things, but he is suspected for anything that is required to perform that thing. For example, one who was suspected of selling prohibited animal fat instead of permitted fat, and he would get youths to come buy from him by providing nuts, they fine him so that he could not sell even nuts.
One who is suspect for a serious forbidden ace is suspect for an act with a lighter punishment, unless people are more cautious about that act than the serious act.
One suspected about two things, and he ceases to do them, but then afterwards is found to still be doing one of them, even if it is the more lenient of the two, we are concerned that perhaps he has returned to performing the other act as well, and is suspected regarding both of them,
One who publicly transgressed the Torah, except for idol worship and Sabbath desecration, or who does not believe the words of our rabbis, is believed with regards to other prohibitions. And regarding others he is believed, even on that same issue, to say that they are permitted. Rema: One who is suspected regarding a thing that is not common for people to transgress is not considered suspect, and in any case, for that same matter he is not believed. One who is accustomed to a particular forbidden act as he considers the law to be so, or with regards to a stringency that he holds himself to, it is permitted to eat with others that believe this to be permitted, as certainly they would not eat something that is considered forbidden.
One suspected about an act is not believed regarding it, even if he takes an oath.
A convert that becomes an apostate out of fear, and so too a Jew that sins out of fear that he will be killed, is still considered a Jew, and his ritual slaughter is still permitted, and he does not cause wine to be forbidden with his touch.
One who reports others to the government, his ritual slaughter is kosher and he is believed regarding other prohibitions.
An apostate who believes in idol worship in one city, on account of the non-Jews there, and in another city of Jews claims he is a Jew, he does not make wine forbidden.
One whom is forced to convert that remains in our lands, if he keeps kosher, whether with them or on his own, and is not able to flee so that he should be able to serve G-d, we can rely on his ritual slaughter and he does not forbid wine with his touch.
One who sells his friend forbidden food, and knew before he ate it, his friend should return the food to where he bought it from and the shopkeeper should return his money. And if he only knew when he ate it, what he ate he ate, and he should return the remainder for a refund. And if the seller bought it to sell to non-Jews, he should pay him the value of non-kosher food. And if it was something that is not forbidden to be eaten except according to the rabbis, or if it was forbidden fruit, he should return the fruit for a refund, and if he ate it, what he ate he ate, and the shopkeeper should not return his money at all. And all are forbidden to benefit from, even something prohibited by the rabbis, the value should be returned and they should not be sold at all.
One who sells meat, and afterwards it is know that the animals were not checked properly, their rule is like that of something forbidden by the rabbis. Rema: And if he sold animals that had a presumption of being kosher, but something happened that he was unable to check it, even so it should be considered as something that is certainly not kosher and needs to be returned for a refund.
One who sells forbidden foods, he should remove and destroy them, and there is no reparation that can be done unless he moves to a new place where they do not recognize him and return lost items or slaughter for himself and cease producing forbidden foods, so that his repentance will be without tricks, since he would not himself transgress.
A cook that sells items he makes and wants to cause the public to stumble by eating non-kosher food, for example a slaughterer that cuts off the lesions from a lung to make it appear kosher, should be stoned, and in any case he is excused from paying back those who bought from him.
A cook that cooks non-kosher food is unable to apologize saying, "I made a mistake."
A cook that makes non-kosher food by his own hand, but is not an expert, he has the chance to learn from his mistakes. Rema: And so it is necessary to go to a place where he will not be recognized and to repent, this is because he intentionally transgressed or strengthened this act, but if he is able to swear by an oath that it was done accidentally, it is enough that his friends can trust his word, and he shall repent as the judge sees fit. And see above in chapter 64.
One who says to another that is suspected of eating non-Jewish cheese: "Buy some kosher cheese for me from the cheesemaker," and he goes and brings him cheese and says to him: "This is kosher, I bought it from the cheesemaker," he is not believed. If he said, "I bought it from so-and-so the cheesemaker," he is believed. If he brings a gift from the cheesemaker, he is believed, because he is not suspected of switching products. About what are we speaking? When there is no suspicion of outright robber, but if he is suspected of this, then he is suspected of switching products. And all this is not regarding someone who is suspected of breaking Torah laws.
One who is suspected of eating that which not many are so lenient as to eat normally, even he is suspected of switching products. And there are those that say that we do not trust him regarding something forbidden by the Torah except with two seals.

1) Mehaber: All the images of star worshippers found in villages are forbidden, since, apparently, they were made as idols, but those found in cities are permissible, since they were certainly made for the sake of beauty, unless they stand at the entrance of the city, and an image of a staff or a bird or a ball or a sword or a diadem and a ring is in the hand.

A city in which they (idol worshipers) are making a fair on the day of their festival, and the idol worshipers are gathering from a number of places and are traveling there for the honor of idol worship, it is permitted to travel on its outskirts and it is forbidden to enter it. If (the fair) is on its outskirts, it is permitted to enter it. One who is traveling from one place to another place, it is forbidden to pass through it if the path is specific to (that city) (That is, that one does not pass [through that path] from that city to another city.)
When is this said? By a lodger. But a resident of a city is permitted. And if he is traveling by caravan it is permitted. (Ram"a: A courtyard of idol worship, some say its law is like a city of idol worship. (Tur quoting the Rashb"a) And at a time that the idol worshipers to not gather there for their "prayers", it is permitted to enter there. (Tur quoting R' Yonah and the Ros"h) And some say that under any circumstances it is forbidden if there is no way to pass through it to another place. But if the path passes to another place all agree that it is permitted. And so the custom is widespread to go through that courtyard to another place. (Rashb"a) Nevertheless, the pious act is to distance oneself form going through it if there is another path of similar shortness. (D"A and so is implied in the Sefer Chasidim) And see above, Chapter 142.

One [i.e., a Jew] should not follow the customs of non-Jews (nor should one try to resemble them). One should not wear clothing that is particular to them [i.e., their culture]; one should not grow forelocks on one’s head like the forelocks on their heads; one should not shave the sides [of one’s head] and grow one’s hair in the middle of one’s head [like they do]; one should not shave the hair in front of one’s face from ear to ear and let one’s hair grow [in the back] [like they do]; one should not build places [i.e., buildings]—like the non-Jews’ temples—so that large groups of people will enter them, like [non-Jews] do. RAMA: Rather, one [i.e., a Jew] should be distinct from them [i.e., non-Jews] in one’s manner of dress and in all of one’s actions. But all of this [i.e., these restrictions] apply only to things that non-Jews do for the sake of licentiousness. For example, they are accustomed to wearing red clothing, which is official/princely clothing, and other clothing that is similarly immodest. [These restrictions also apply] to things that they are accustomed to doing because of a custom or rule that does not have a[ny underlying] reason, out of concern that [a Jew who does such things will follow the] “ways of the Amorites,” and that it has the blemish of [i.e., is tainted by] idol worship inherited from their ancestors. But things that they are accustomed to doing for a useful purpose—such as their custom for expert doctors to wear particular clothing so that the doctors will be recognized as specialists—one is permitted to wear [such clothing]. Similarly, things that are done out of respect or another reason, it is permitted [for one to do such things]. And therefore they said one may burn [the items of deceased] kings, and there is not in this “the ways of the Amorites.”
One [i.e., a Jew] who is close [i.e., works closely] with the [non-Jewish] authorities and is required to dress in their clothing and to be similar [in appearance] to them, is permitted in all respects [to do so].

Incised writing, defined as cutting his flesh and filling the place of cutting with kohl [following the emendation of Biur HaGra YD 180.2] or ink or any other dye that leaves a mark.
If he does this on his friend's flesh, the one to whom it was done is exempt unless he aided in the matter.
One is permitted to put ash on his wound.
One who marks his slave lest he escape is exempt (But it seems that, in the first place, it is forbidden).

Every Jewish man is obligated in studying Torah, whether poor or rich, whether completely healthy or suffering, whether young or very old. Even a poor man who frequents doorways (to beg) and even one with a wife and children is obligated to set a time for himself to study Torah, by day or by night, as it says, "And you shall meditate in it day and night." (And in a pressing time, even if he only read Shem"a in the morning or evening, it is called "It shall not be moved..." (HG"M 1 &amp; SM"G Asin 12). And one that it is impossible for him to learn because he does not know how to at all or because of troubles that he has, should support others who study. Haga"h: And it will be considered for him as if he learned himself (Tur) And a person is able to make a condition with his friend, that he will study Torah and he will support him, and he will split the reward with him. But if he already toiled in Torah, he is unable to sell him his portion for the money he will give to him. (TA"V? path 2  from Bavli Sotah)

Charity dispels harsh decrees and famine (&amp;) saves from death as happened at Zarephath: Gloss: (RAMA) This is referring to tithing and one should not test God except in this regard as it was said {Malachi 3,10} "And try Me now herewith" [with tithing] (Tur from the last chapter of Gemara Tanit), and there are those who say that specifically in regards to giving tithes [on produce from Israel] is it allowed to test the Holy One Blessed be His name, but not in regards to other forms of charity. (The Bais Yosef seems to hold this way from Shas there):

A lower level than this is one who gives tzedakah to a poor person and doesn't know to whom they are giving, and the poor person doesn't know from whom they are receiving. And similar to this, is when you give to a charitable fund - and you only give to a charitable fund if you know that the trustee responsible for the fund knows how to run it properly.

One who gives his non-minor sons and daughters, whom he is not obligated to feed, in order to teach the sons Torah and to direct the daughters on the straight path, and so one who gives gifts to his father and they need them, behold this is in the category of tzedakah.  And not only that, but he is required to give [the relative] precedence over others.  And even if it is not his son or father, but a relative, he must give him precedence to all others.  Ans his paternal brother takes precedence over his maternal brother.  And the poor of his household take precedence over the poor of his city; and the poor of his city take precedence over the poor of another city.  (so is found in the Sma”g and Sma”k and Tur)
Gloss:  Those who are fixed in a city are called the poor of that city, and they take precedence to other poor people who come there from elsewhere (Tur, unlike R”Y son of Baruch).  
The residents of Israel take precedence to the residents of the diaspora.
Gloss:  Supporting himself takes precedence over everyone, and he is not obligated to give tzedakah until he has his own sustenance, and afterwards he prioritizes the support of his father and mother, if they are poor, and they take precedence to sustaining his sons.  And afterwards, his sons, and they take precedence to his brothers, and they take precedence to other relatives, and relatives take precedence to neighbors, and neighbors to the people of the city, and the people of his city to the people of another city.  And the same is true if they were taken captive and he needed to redeem them  (This is all in the Tur)

One must prioritize feeding the hungry over clothing the naked.
..
A man and a woman who came to ask for food, we give precedence to the woman over the man.  And so if they came to ask for clothing.  And so if male and female orphans came to get married, they give precedence to the female orphan to marry her off..

It is forbidden to eat new (crop) of the five types of grain until the Omer is brought, which is the 16th of Nissan. As it says, “And bread, toasted grain, and unripe (or damp) grain you may not eat until (the end of) this very day.” And in these times that there is no Omer, it is forbidden (on) all of the 16th day. And outside of Israel where we observe two days, it is forbidden (on) all of the 17th day, until the beginning of the night of the 18th.
The prohibition of (eating) new (grain) is practiced both in Israel and outside Israel, whether of a Jew’s (grain) or a non-Jew’s.
Grain that did not take root before the 16th of Nissan is forbidden until the next Omer comes. Rama: And nevertheless, all indeterminate grain is permitted after Passover because of a double doubt. Perhaps it comes from the previous year. And even if you’ll say that it came from this year, nevertheless, perhaps it took root before the Omer (Tur quoting the Rosh).  And in types of grain that they certainly plant after Pesach, for example in some countries where they plant spelt and barley after Passover, then he should be stringent after the harvest, unless the gates of the country are not closed and most of the grain comes from another place where they plant before Passover. (Hg”M Ch. 11 from the M”A &amp; Tos. End of Ch. 1 of Kiddushin) And also, in a time when the winter season extends to after Passover, and in all of that region they plant the abovementioned crops after Passover, one should be stringent and suspect unless known otherwise. But one should not teach others in a place where most of their drinking and eating is from these species, because it is better that they be negligent and not to be pre-meditated. (So it seems in the Tur quoting the Rosh and T”H Ch. 158)

In this era, even in a place where Jews ascending from the Diaspora have acquired a presumption of ownership, and even in the days of Ezra (the Scribe), there is no pentateuchal obligation of priestly gifts and tithes; rather, a rabbinic obligation exists, since the verse says, "When you shall come...," implying when all of you will ascend to the land, and not a partial Aliyah, as there was in the days of Ezra.  <i>Gloss: And there are dissenters, and their position is that [even] nowadays we are biblically obligated <u>in the land of Israel</u> in priestly gifts and tithes, yet we do not follow this custom (Yaakov ben Asher (Ba'al ha-Turim) quoting Rabeinu Yitzchak).</i>

...It is a religious obligation to visit the sick. Relatives and close friends may visit immediately and others after three days. But if he (the sick) is gravely ill, all may visit immediately.
...A person of high status should visit even a person of modest status, even several times a day, and [one should also visit] one's peer. Anyone who exceeds this standard is worthy of praise, but one should take care not to burden the patient.  There are those who maintain that even an enemy should visit the sick individual (Maharal 197). This does not seem correct to me, rather one should not visit a patient or comfort a mourner who is one's enemy lest the [suffering person] think that [the enemy] is rejoicing in his misfortune, which will only cause more suffering. And this is what seems correct to me. 
...The visitor should not sit on the bed, nor on a chair nor on a bench but rather wrap himself (in tallit?) and sit before him because the Divine Presence rests above his head. Isserles: Especially if the sick person is laying on the ground because the one sitting would be higher then him but if he is laying on a bed it is permitted to sit on a chair or bench....
...We do not visit a sick person during the first three hours of the day because the illness is less pronounced in the morning and one might be tempted not to pray for him; nor during the last three hours of the day because the illness is more severe then and one might despair of praying for mercy. (And anyone who visits the sick and doesn't pray for him has not fulfilled the mitzvah.) (Bet Yosef based on Ramban.)
...When one prays for mercy for the patient, if one is doing so in the patient's presence, one may pray in any language he desires, but if this is not in the patient's presence, one must only pray in the Holy Tongue [Hebrew].
...[When one prays for the sick person] one should include in the prayer a request on behalf of all of the ill among the Jewish people, saying, "May the One have mercy upon you among the people of Israel," and on Shabbat, one should say, "It is Shabbat and we don't cry out on Shabbat, but healing is near at hand."
...We tell the patient that he should attend to his affairs; if he owes or is owed money, but he should not take this inquiry as evidence that he is dying and become afraid.
...We don't visit patients with intestinal maladies, nor eye disorders, nor mental disorders, nor those who have difficulty speaking. We don't visit in these patients' presence, rather, we enter the vestibule of their house and ask after their welfare, inquiring whether they need anything in particular, and we listen to learn about the suffering of [the patient? the caregiver?], and we pray for the patient.
...We visit the sick non-Jews because for the "ways of peace" (mipnei darkei shalom)


Siman 336

The Torah gives permission for physicians to practice, and it is in fact commanded under the category of saving a life. Furthermore, if it is withheld from someone, it is equivalent to murder [lit. spilling blood]. This is true even if [the patient] has [another] physician, since not just anyone is qualified to practice medicine. Someone should not occupy themselves with practicing medicine unless they are an expert, and there is not a greater [physician] available. If [one practices medicine although] this is not the case, it is equivalent to murder [lit. spilling blood]. If one practices medicine without the permission of the court, they are liable to pay [a penalty for malpractice], even if they are an expert. If one practices medicine with the permission of the court, but makes an error resulting in injury, they are exempt from human judgement but liable to heavenly judgement. If [a physician] killed [a patient] and knows it was [the result of] an error, [the physician] it exiled on account of it.
The physician is forbidden to exact payment for advice or teaching, but payment for effort and (unknown) are permitted.

One who is dying is like a living person for all his affairs.  They do not die his cheeks, and they do not annoint him, and they do not wash him, and they do not stuff up his orifices, and they do not remove the pillow from under him, and they do not place him on sand nor on clay nor on earth, and they do not place a pot or a trowel or a pitcher of water or a grain of salt on his stomach, and they do not announce about him to the cities, and they do not hire flautists and lamenters, and they do not close his eyes, until his soul departs.  And anyone who closes with the departuer of the soul, behold this one spills blood.  And they do not tear over him and they do not remove their shoes and they do not eulogize over him and they do not bring a coffin into the house with him until he dies.  And they do not open about him with [the post-death blessing of] justifying the judgment until his soul departs.  Gloss: and some say that they do not dig a grave, even tough it is not with him in the house, until after he dies.  (Rivash 114)  It is forbidden to dig any grave to be open until the next day, that they not bury him in it on that day, and there is danger in the matter.  (Rabbenu Yeruham in the name of R. Yehudah he-Hassid, ob"n)  And so it is forbidden to cause the dead person to die quickly.  Such as one who was dying for a long time and he could not separate, it is forbidden to remove the pillow or the mattress from underneath hum, because they say that there are feathers of some birds that cause this, and similarly they should not move him from his place.  And similarly it is forbidden to place the keys of the synagogue under his head, in order that he take leave.  But if there is something there that is causing delay in the departure of the soul, such as if there is a banging noise next to that house, such as a wood chopper, or there is salt on his tongue, and thes eare preventing the departure of the soul, it is permmitted to remove it from there, that in this there is no activity at all, rather he removes the barrier (it is all in the glosses of Alfasi in the chapter "these shave")....

Someone who commits suicide, we do not deal with him [i.e. his mourning] for any purpose. We do not mourn for him, or eulogize for him, or tear our clothing for him, or remove shoes for him. We only stand for him on a line and say the blessing of mourners for him, and any other thing that is respectful for the living.
Who is a considered a suicide? Someone such as a person who said: “I [lit. “he”] is going up to the roof,”, and they saw him go up while angry or he was in distress, and he fell and died, he is considered a suicide. But if he was strangled and hanging in a tree, or dead and found on his sword, he is considered like any other dead person and we may deal with him and do not take anything away from him. HAGAH – One who stole and was killed for this by law of the land, we may mourn for him if there is no danger from fear of the government, and this person is not called a suicide.
A minor, who knowingly commits suicide - is counted as if it was done unknowingly.  Such is also the case with an adult who knowingly commits suicide but does so under distress, like King Saul - we do not withhold anything from him.

All the relatives for whom a kohen must become impure – his father, his mother, his son, his daughter, his brother and his virgin sister through his father, and his wife – one mourns them. They [i.e. the sages] further added to them – his brother from his mother, his sister from his mother whether a virgin or married and his married sister through his father – one mourns for them, even though a kohen may not become impure for them. Also, just as one mourns for his wife, thus also she mourns for him [her husband] – but only for his wife who is permitted to him and who is married, but if she is forbidden to him or [only] betrothed, one does not [mourn]. However, for his son, his daughter, his brother and his sister – even though they are [from an] invalid [pairing], he mourns them, except for his son, his daughter, his brother or his sister from a maidservant or a gentile – he does not mourn them.
A convert who converted to Judaism, he and his children, or a slave who is emancipated, he and his mother, they do not mourn each other. {Rema: And this is the rule also for a convert who converted to Judaism with his mother, they do not mourn for each other}.
All whom one mourns, he mourns with him if a relative [of the latter, i.e. the one for whom the first would mourn were the latter to die] dies. But this is only in his presence, but when not in his presence, it is not necessary to conduct mourning rituals. [However, this is true] other than with regard to his wife, who, even though he would mourn over her, he does not mourn with her, except for her father or her mother because of [the mitzvah of] honoring one's father-in-law and mother-in-law, but over her brother and sister or her son and daughter from another man, one does not mourn with her. But in any event, he cannot force her to adorn herself, but she can mix a cup for him and make his bed and wash his face and hands and legs. And similarly, she does not mourn with him, except for when her father-in-law or mother-in-law dies, but other of his relatives who die, she does not mourn with him. {Rema: And there are those who say that nowadays, the practice is to be lenient in this mourning with those for whom one would mourn, because this is only for the honor of the mourners, and nowadays all of them relinquish their honor. And thus the practice nowadays is not to mourn at all with those for whom one would mourn, and all who are strict with regard to this are considered shocking. But in any event, the practice is that all the relatives of the dead person who are forbidden to him as witnesses indicate a little of mourning themselves for all of the first week. That is to say, until after the first Shabbat, they do not wash and they do not change some of their clothing as they would on other Shabbatot. And there are places where the practice is to be stringent in other ways, but the essence is like I wrote. And all this is for word of a death that arrived soon after the death, or who was at the house when he died, but one who long after the death, there is no place for this mourning at all. [But] one who wants to be stringent for himself to mourn one for whom it is not necessary or to wear black on account of his relative, we do not prevent him}.
One does not mourn with his relatives for whom one would have to mourn [who are mourning over their dead] except for when they are mourning over a blood relative – e.g. his son or his brother when they mourn over the son or daughter of one of them – but over the marital relatives of them – e.g. when the wife of his son or the wife of his brother or the husband of his daughter or the husband of his sister dies, he does not mourn over them.
A baby for all the first thirty days, and including the thirtieth day, one does not mourn for him even if his hair or his nails finished [coming in]. But from then onward, one mourns for him unless it is known that he was born after eight (months of gestation which would be considered unviable). But if one can trust that his months were completed, as in a case when he had sex and then separated and it was born alive after nine complete months, even if the baby died on the day it was born, one mourns over it. (If there is a doubt whethera child is [the product] of 9 months [of gestation] to the first [husband] or seven to the last [husband] the two of them (i.e. both potential fathers) mourn over him.

Siman 375

From when does the period of mourning begin? From when he is buried and the filling of the grave with dust is finished, immediately the period of mourning begins and he wraps his head, but he does not take off his shoes until he arrives at his home. And now the practice is to take off shoes immediately after the closing of the burial slab as is [discussed] in Siman 376. Gloss: If he thought that the grave was closed and began to mourn and afterwards he it became known to him that there was a mistake, he returns and begins mourning anew.
For whomever it is their custom to send the deceased to another city in order to bury him and they don’t know when he will be buried, from the time when they turn their faces away from accompanying, they begin to count shiva and shloshim and they begin to mourn. And those who go with him (i.e. the deceased) count from when he is buried. And if the senior member of the family goes with him, even those who are here (i.e. who stay in the city) do not count until he is buried. And the senior member of the family is the one on whom the household relies, and they are all drawn after him, whether he is a brother, whether he is a son not yet at the age of majority. And there is one who says that he must be at least 13 years old.




One who drowned in [a body of] water that had an end [i.e. with reasonably close shores], or about whom a rumor went out that thieves killed him or a wild animal dragged him, from when do we count (i.e. shiva and shloshim)? From when they despair of searching (lit. requesting). If they found him dismembered (lit. limbs by limbs) and they identify him by signs on his body they do not count until they find his head and the majority of his body or they despair of searching. And if they find him after they had despaired of finding him, the relatives do not need to go back and mourn; but the sons, if they were present at the moment he was found, they mourn on the same day, since it is not any less significant than the gathering his father’s bones. But if they are not there but they heard after the day had passed, they do not need to mourn. Gloss: If they sent their deceased to another city in which case the law is to start mourning when they turn around, and they began to count the period of mourning, and afterwards, the deceased was captured and it was not possible to be bury him for a long time, they do not need to stop their mourning and they do not need to go back and mourn afterwards, for since their rule is to begin immediately, they do not need to stop.

These are the things which are forbidden to the mourner – melacha (work), washing, annointing with oils (perfume), wearing shoes, sexual relations (lit. use of the bed). And it is forbidden to read from the Torah and forbidden to say hello or do laundry, and one is obligated to wrap one’s head and to overturn the bed all seven days (i.e. of shiva). And it is forbidden to lay tefillin on the first day and it is forbidden to iron or to get a haircut, or to be happy and to stitch together the tear all thirty days (and all of the elements of mourning are in effect whether it is day or night)
Work – how? Throughout the first three days, work is forbidden even if he is a poor person who is sustained by tzedakkah. From this point on, if he is poor and he does not have what to eat, he [works] privately inside his house. And a woman spins on a spindle inside the house. But the hachamim [sages] said that a curse should come upon his neighbors who made it necessary for him to do this. (In the same manner[i.e. for those things] in which it is permitted to write on hol hamoed, it is thus permitted to write during the days of mourning, not in other matters)
Just as he [the mourner] is forbidden to work, so too he is forbidden to trade (lit. give and take) merchandise and to travel between cities for business purposes (lit. to go from one city to another for merchandise).
Even something that would cause a [financial] loss (as opposed to work done for monetary gain) is forbidden to the mourner to do – whether it is he, his servants, his maidservants, his sons, or his daughters since he is entitled to the product of their labor (lit. hands).
It is forbidden to do work through others (even a non-Jew) unless it is something which has the potential to depreciate since something which depreciates is permitted to be done by others. Even something which is forbidden on hol hamoed because of laboring is permitted and even if this is professional-quality artisanship. Hagah – And there are those who say that if he is not able to do it through others and it is something which depreciates, then it is permitted for the mourner to do it by himself. And after the first three days one can be lenient and even during the first three days if there is a potentially great [financial] loss.
















Sweeping the house, rinsing glasses and making the bed – they do not fall into the category of work for a mourner. And so too, it is permissible for a woman to bake and cook during the days of her mourning (what she needs, but what she does not need, is forbidden). And so too a woman serves in the house of another head of household, and her mourning is taking place, she is permitted to bake and cook and to provide for all the other needs of the household whether she serves free of charge or for a wage.

A mourner is forbidden to engage in greetings. How does this work? For the first three days he does not greet anyone and if others do not know that he is mourning and greet him, he should not respond to them. Rather, he should inform them that he is mourning. From the third to the seven day, he should not greet people, but if others do not know that he is mourning and greet him, he should respond. From the seventh day to the 30th day, he can greet others, for they are dwelling peacefully, but others should not greet him. And all the more so, he can respond to one who greets him. After 30 days he is like any other person. To what does this [the previous laws] refer? For his other relatives, but for his father and mother, he can greet others after seven days but others should not greet him until after 12 months. Rema: And since he is forbidden from greeting, all the more so [is he forbidden from] being overly talkative. But if he is acting for the honor of the public, for example, many people are coming to greet comfort him, he is permitted to say to them, “go home in peace,” because this is permitted for the honor of the public. And there are those who are lenient in this age [regarding] greeting a mourner after 30 days, and they don’t have a [good]reason, unless they will make a distinction and say that that which we do is not called [i.e. considered like] the “greeting” that was in their day
One who finds his fellow a mourner in the first 30 days, he should comfort him but should not greet him. After 30 days he can greet him, but should not comfort him in the usual manner, rather in an subtle way, namely, that he should not mention to him the name of the deceased, rather he should say to him, “be comforted.” If his wife died and he married someone else, one should not enter [the mourner’s] house to comfort him. If he found him in the marketplace he should say to him, “be comforted,” in a soft voice and with seriousness. But if he has not remarried he should comfort him until 3 festivals have passed. And for one’s father or mother one should comfort him all 12 months and after 12 months one should comfort him in an subtle way.

A mourner is prohibited in joy; therefore he should not take a baby in his bosom all of Shiva, because perhaps he will come to levity.
For all dead one enters the drinking house after 30 days; for his father or for his mother, after the 12th month. And even if the year is intercalated [such that it has 13 months] one is permitted to after 12 months… Rama: And a gathering for a mitzvah, such as one who marries a male or female orphan for the sake of Heaven, and if he does not eat there the thing will not happen, he is allowed to after 30 days, but during the 30 days he cannot go to any Mitzvah meals in the world. But a Mitzvah meal where there is not joy he is allowed to attend, such as a Pidyon HaBen or a Brit Milah meal, and he is allowed to eat there even if it is during the Shiva, provided that he does not leave his home. And there are those who forbid eating at the meal of a Brit Milah and the custom is to not eat in any banquet during the 12 months if it is outside of his home, and inside the home we are lenient and he can eat during the Brit Milah meal and all the more so during meals that do not have joy. But in the wedding meal one should be stringent for it—so it seems to me. A mourner who is the father of a son to be circumcised or is a Mohel may wear clothes for Shabbat until after the Bris and he is allowed to attend the Bris to eat there if it is after the 30 days even though the Bris is not in his home.
To attend a Chupah not during the time of eating, to hear the blessings, there are those who permit and there are those who forbid; rather he should stand outside the house to hear the blessings. Rama: But do not enter the house at all when they are engaged in entertaining the Bride and Groom, and such is the Ashkenazic custom and in these countries. And all of this applies to a where the wedding occurs, but the Chuppah that they do in the synagogue, where they recite the blessings over the bethrothal and the marriage, and this is not considered festive, he is allowed to attend immedately after the Shiva is over, and there are those who forbid until after 30 days, and so it appears to me. And there are places that are strict for the mourner to stay during the 12 months outside the synagogue to hear the blessings, and in any case it appears that the Mourner can bless the betrothal and wedding blessings beneath the Chuppah that is in the synagogue and he can bring in the groom, as is the custom of our land, that two people bring in the groom under the Chuppah. And he can wear some Shabbat clothes at the time that he brings him in, and only if this is after the 30 days and this is the custom. There are those who permit the mourner to eat at a wedding meal or at a Bris with the servants, but only if it is not at the place of joy, for example, at another house. And there are those who forbid this, and such is the custom. Rather, the mourner should do some service there, if he wants, and eat in his house from what was sent from the meal. There are those who permit him to eat at that meal of fish that is made after the wedding, for since they have already ended saying “that the joy that we have is in God’s midst,” there is a reminder that there is not festivity in that meal, so it is permitted. There are those who say it is forbidden for one to eat in a meal at night in the day after the death of a mother or father.
