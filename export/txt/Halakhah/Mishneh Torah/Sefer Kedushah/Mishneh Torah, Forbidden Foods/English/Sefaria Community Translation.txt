Chapter 1

1) It is a positive commandment to know the simanim (signs) that distinguish between domesticated and wild animals, birds and fish, and grasshoppers that are permitted to be eaten, and those that are forbidden for consumption, as it says, (Leviticus 20:25) "And you shall distinguish between a kosher animal and a non-kosher animal, between a non-kosher fowl and a kosher fowl." And it says, (Leviticus 11:47) "To distinguish between the kosher and the non-kosher, between a beast which may be eaten and one which may not be eaten."

Ten stores: nine sell kosher meat and one sell non-kosher meat, and one takes meat from one of them, but does not know which one the meat was taken from, this [meat] is forbidden, as every established place is like a half of a half [i.e. each established location is treated as its own majority]. But meat that is found thrown in the marketplace, you can follow the majority, as anything separated [is considered to be] separated from the majority. If the majority of sellers are non-Jews, it is forbidden; and if the majority of sellers are Jews, it is permitted.
