Chapter 1

Every human being has many dispositions, and everyone is both different and very distant from anyone else: One person may have a violent temper, always angry; but another's mind is at ease and he is never angry, or if he does feel anger it is a soft anger once in several years. A person may be very haughty, but another has a very humble disposition. A person may have very strong desires, never satisfied; but another may have a very pure heart, not even desiring those few things that the body requires. A person may be very greedy, not satisfied by all the wealth in the world, as it says, "A lover of silver never has his fill of silver" (Ecclesiastes 5:9). But another may have modest desires, and is satisfied with the smallest thing even if it is not truly enough for him, and he will not exert himself to acquire what he needs.
Between each pair of extremes, there is a middle disposition equidistant from each. There are some dispositions that are innate, and some that individuals are more predisposed to than other, and still others that are not innate at all, but are learned from others or self-taught either because he decided to acquire [this trait] or he heard from others that it is a good one to have and he practiced it until it became part of his personality.
Neither of the two extremes within each trait are appropriate ways to live, and one should not practice these extremes, and if he finds himself naturally inclined to one of them, or he already learned one of them, he should work himself back to the good life, that is the "straight path."
The "straight path" is (generally) the middle trait within each [pair of] dispositions, equidistant from each extreme. Therefore the early sages commanded that a person should constantly pay attention to her character, measure it, and keep it on the middle path so that he might be physically healthy (lit. wholesome).  For example, one should not be temperamental and easily angered, nor should he be numb like a corpse. Rather, she should be somewhere in the middle -- not getting angry except over something important that is worth it, and then just enough to ensure it won't happen again.  Similarly, only desire the things that the body actually needs to live as it says "The righteous man eats to satisfy his body." (i.e. he enjoys healthy food in moderation, neither an ascetic nor a glutton) Similarly, he should only work enough to earn a living as it says "a little is good for the righteous" (i.e. neither lazy nor a workaholic) neither overly cheap nor generous, rather give as much charity as she can afford and give sensible loans to those who need. He should not be constantly partying and clowning around, nor should he be depressed and morose rather be calm and content, with a pleasant face all his life, and so on for all other character traits. This is the way of the Sages; anyone whose character is completely balanced may be called a sage.
One who is carefully self-reflective, and who thus moves oneself from one's norm toward one side or the other: this one is called pious. For instance, one who moves oneself away from proud-heartedness toward the opposite side and attains a lowly spirit: he is called pious, and his is the middah of piety.  But if he moves himself only toward the middle [of the scale] and becomes humble, he is called wise, and his is the middah of wisdom. And so on: this is so with all the rest of the middot.  The early pious ones would incline their dispositions from the middle of the scale toward one of the two extremes: some would incline toward the first extreme and others would incline toward the other.  This is  going beyond what the law requires.  We are commanded to walk in these intermediate paths which are good and straight, as it is said: "Walk in [God's] ways."  [Deuteronomy 28:9]
They taught the following interpretation of this commandment: "Just as God is called 'gracious,' you too must be gracious. Just as God is called 'compassionate,' you too must be compassionate.  Just as God is called 'holy,' you too must be holy." As such, the Prophets called God by many appellations: "Slow to Anger," "Abundant in Graciousness," "Just and Fair," "Pure," "Mighty," and "Powerful" - in order to demonstrate that these are good and proper ways for a person to accustom oneself to act, in imitation of God to the utmost of one's ability.
This is how one trains himself towards these dispositions until they become part of his personality: By constant, repetitive practice of the actions [characteristic of] the golden mean and drill over and over, constantly until these actions are easy, and are no longer challenging. Through this practice, these traits will become part of the personality for they are attributes of the Creator and the middle road which we are obligated to walk, which is called the "Path of God." This is what our father Abraham taught his sons, as it says "for I know him, so that he will command his sons and his household, etc." and one who follows this path brings good to himself as it says "in order to bring to Abraham all that He spoke of him."

Chapter 3


A person must direct his heart and all his actions to know only God, blessed be He, and it should be that his resting, his rising, his speech, all corresponding to this. How? That when he does business, or does some work to gain money, his mindset should not be merely to collect money, but to do these things so that he can get things that the body needs, food and drink, and shelter in a house, and marrying a woman. And similarly when he eats, drinks, and has relations, he should not have the mindset to do these things merely for pleasure's sake to the point that he only eats and drinks things sweet to the palate, and has relations only for pleasure, rather he has the mindset that he will eat and drink only in order to keep his body and limbs healthy. Therefore, he should not eat all that his palate desires, like a dog or a donkey, rather he should eat things that are beneficial to the body, whether they are bitter or sweet, and he should not eat things bad for the body, even though they are sweet to the palate. How? One whose skin is warm should not eat meat, nor honey, nor should he drink wine, like Solomon said by way of proverb, (Proverbs 25:27) "Eating too much honey is not good." And one should drink endive juice, even though it is bitter. Consequently, he is drinking and eating for the purpose of health only, so that he'll be healthy, and he can remain whole, since it is impossible for someone to live without food and drink. And similarly, when one has relations, he should not have relations except for bodily health, and to continue his seed. Therefore, one should not have relations any time he desires it, but any time he knows that he needs to emit seed for health reasons or to continue his seed.

Chapter 4



A person should  always eat seated in his place or reclining on his left side.  He shouldn't walk and he shouldn't ride and he shouldn't exert himself and he shouldn't shake his body and he shouldn't stroll until he has digested the meal in his intestines.  And everyone who strolls after eating or exerts himself, behold this one bring upon himself harmful and difficult illnesses.

Chapter 5



Chapter 6

It is  human nature to be attracted to the ideas and actions of one's neighbors and friends and to follow the customs of the people of his land.  Therefore, a person needs to bind himself to the righteous and always dwell in the midst of the wise in order that he might learn from their deeds and keep far from the evil ones who walk in darkness so as not to learn from their deeds.  As Solomon says in Proverbs 13:20, "He who walks with the wise becomes wise and he who befriends fools will suffer."  As it says, (Psalms 1:1), Happy is the man (who has not followed the advice of the wicked).  And thus, if one lives in a land whose customs are evil and people do not follow a straight path, one should go to a land where the people are righteous and are accustomed to following a good path.  And if all the lands that he knows and hears reports of are accustomed to follow a path that is not good, like our time, or it is not possible to go to a land where people are accustomed to do good, because of troops or health, he should remain alone by himself, as it says, "Sit alone and be silent (Lamentations 3:28)."  If they are evil and sinful people and do not allow him to stay there in the land unless he mixes among them and follows their evil ways, he should go out to caves, thickets and desserts.  He shall not accustom himself to the way of the sinners, as it says, "Who will give me in the wilderness, a lodging for guests (Jeremiah 9:1)."

It is a commandment upon every person to love each and every Jew as himself, as it is said, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself (Leviticus 19:18)."  Therefore one needs to speak praises of one and to be as careful with his money as one is with one's own money and desires his own honor.  Whoever gains honor through diminishing his colleague has no portion in the world to come.
The loving of a convert who came and entered under the wings of the Shekhina [comprises of] two positive commandments- one because he is in the general group of fellows [and we must love our fellow as ourselves], and one because he is a convert and the Torah said, "And you shall love the convert-" [Scripture] commanded regarding the love of the convert like [Scripture] commanded regarding the loving of oneself, as it said, "And you shall love Hashem your G-d;" the Holy One, Blessed be He, loves converts, as it is said, "And loving to the convert."
Everyone who hates one from Israel in his heart transgresses a negative commandment, as it is written, "You shall not hate your brother in your heart (Leviticus 19:17)."  There are no lashes for this negative commandment because there is no act involved.  The Torah warns only about hating in one's heart, but striking one's colleague or insulting him even though it is not permissible, is not a transgression of "you shall not hate."
When one person sins against another, he should not hate him and be silent, as it says concerning the wicked ones, "And Avshalom did not speak to Amonon, neither bad nor good because Avshalom hated Amnon (II Samuel 13:22)."  Rather, it is a mitzvah to inform him and say to him, "Why did you do this to me?" "And why did you wrong me in this matter?"  As it says, "You shall surely rebuke your kinsman (Leviticus 19:17)." And if he returns and asks forgiveness from him, he needs to forgive.  The one forgiving should not be cruel as it says, "And Abraham prayed to God...(Genesis 20:17)"
One who sees his colleague sin or follow a path that is not good, it is a mitzvah to warn him for his own good and inform him that he is sinning against himself by his wicked deeds, as it says, "You shall surely rebuke your kinsman (Leviticus 19:17)."  One who rebukes his colleague, whether over matters that are between him and his colleague or matters between his colleague and God, one needs to rebuke him privately and speak to him quietly and patiently and inform him that you are not speaking to him except for his good and for the sake of his entering the world to come.  If he accepts the rebuke, it is good.  If he does not, rebuke him a second time and a third time.  Thus a person is always obligated to rebuke until he (the rebuked) strikes him and says "I will not listen."  Every one  that has the opportunity to rebuke and does not rebuke, he is responsible for that sin, because he had the opportunity to rebuke him.
One who rebukes his colleague at first should not speak harshly to him until he becomes embarrassed, as it says, "And you shall not bear a sin because of him (Leviticus 19:17)."  Thus our sages say, "Can you rebuke him and face changes [color]?"  Tradition teaches, " And you shall not bear a sin because of him (Leviticus 19:17)."  From here, it is forbidden for a person to embarrass his fellow Jew and even more so, in public.  Even if one embarrassed his colleague, he is not liable for lashes.  It is [still] a great sin.  Thus our sages say, "One who causes the face of his colleague to turn white in public, does not have a share in the world to come."  Therefore a person needs to be careful not to embarrass his colleague in public, whether he is lesser or greater, He should not call him a names that causes embarrassment, nor tell a story that causes him embarrassment.  To what do these words apply?  To matters that are between people.  But to heavenly matters, if he does not repent [after being rebuked] in private, embarrass him in public and publicize his sin.  He may be abused, scorned and cursed until he returns toward goodness as did all the prophets in Israel.
