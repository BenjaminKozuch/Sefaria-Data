Mishneh Torah, Plaintiff and Defendant

Chapter 1



Chapter 2



Chapter 3



Chapter 4




One who makes a partial admission is not obligated to take an oath until he admits something he could have denied. How so? The plaintiff claimed that he was owed one hundred Dinars, fifty in this bill and fifty without, and the defendant responded "I do not owe you but this fifty in the bill" -- he is not one who has made a partial admission, for his denial of the bill shall have no effect, and all his assets are security for the loan, and if he denied he would still have to pay, therefore he takes a rabbinic oath on the [remaining] fifty.
