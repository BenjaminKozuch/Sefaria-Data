Chapter 1



Chapter 2

We do not appoint to the Sanhedrin, whether large or small, except for men who are wise and understanding, exceptional in knowledge of Torah, possessing deep understanding and knowing a little from other fields of wisdom, such as medicine, mathematics, the seasons, the stars and astrology, fortune telling, magic, sorcery and the emptiness of idolatry so that when these come before them, they will know how to judge them.  And we do not appoint to the Sanhedrin, except for priests, Levites and Israelites of well-known lineage who can marry into the priesthood, as it written,  "And they will stand there with you(Numbers 11:16)." They should resemble you in wisdom, reverence and lineage.










A man can make judgement for himself, if he has strength in his hand and if it is according to the judgement of halakhah.
