Chapter 1









... It is a negative commandment that one should not protect the life of a rodef (pursuer). For this reason, the sages ruled that in the case of a pregnant woman in a dangerous labor, it is permissible to dismember the fetus in her womb - whether with a drug or by hand because it is like a rodef pursuing her to kill her. However, once his head has emerged one may not touch him, as we do not set aside one nefesh [soul] for another, and this is the natural way of the world.




Anyone who can save and does not save transgresses 'do not stand by the blood of your neighbour'. So too one who sees his friend drowning in the sea, bandits attacking him or a bad animal attacking him and he is able himself to save him or he could hire others to save him but he does not; one who hears idol worshippers or informers plotting harm for him or laying a trap for him and he doesn't tell his friend and inform him; or if he knows that an idol worshipper or a thug are on their way to his friend and he could appease them on behalf of his friend to change their intention and he doesn't appease him; and so too any similar case; One who does any of these transgresses 'do not stand idly by your neighbour's blood'.

How [or in what circumstance]? The one who throws a stone into the public domain and it kills [someone] or the one who is taking down his wall into the public domain and a stone fell and it killed [someone]. Either when he took it down during the day or when he took it down at night, behold, he is [considered] grossly negligent and is not exiled [to the city of refuge] because it is a crime, because he should have looked and [only then] afterwards he can throw [the stone] or take down the wall.
If he takes down the wall into the garbage heap at night, if many people are common there, behold, he is [considered] grossly negligent and is not exiled [to the city of refuge]. If many people are not common there at all, behold, it is [considered to be] a freak accident and he is exempt from exile.
If there was a garbage heap that people regularly use [as a bathroom] at night and it is not regularly used [as a bathroom] during the day, and a person is found there, sitting [and using the bathroom], and a stone fell on him at the time of the taking down [of the wall] and he dies, behold, he is exiled.
And this [is also the case when], the one who throws a stone and after it left his hand, that person put out his head and he received [the stone to his face and he died, the thrower] is exempt from exile, as it is said, "and it found his friend” (Deuteronomy 19:5) excludes the one who places himself [in danger].
