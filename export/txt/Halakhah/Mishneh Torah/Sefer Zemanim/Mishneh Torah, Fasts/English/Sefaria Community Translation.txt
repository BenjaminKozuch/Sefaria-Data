Chapter 1

It is a positive commandment from the Torah to cry out and to sound trumpets for all troubles that come upon the community, as it is said, "upon an enemy who attacks you and you sound trumpets (Numbers 10:9)."  That is to say, every matter that troubles you like famine, plague, locusts, and so forth, cry out because of them and sound the trumpets.

Chapter 5

There are days on which all Israel fasts because of the misfortunes that occurred on them in order to arouse the hearts to open to the ways of repentance and that this be a reminder of our evil deeds and the deeds of our ancestors that are like our deeds that caused these misfortunes for them and for us.  In remembering these things we return to goodness, as it is written, "And you shall confess your transgressions and the transgressions of your ancestors...(Leviticus 27:40)"
