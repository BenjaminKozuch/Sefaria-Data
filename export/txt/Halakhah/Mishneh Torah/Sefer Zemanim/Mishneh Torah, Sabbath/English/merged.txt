Chapter 1



Chapter 2

The Sabbath is pushed off when it comes to danger to life, like the rest of the commandments..  Therefore, they do all the needs of a sick person who is in [lifethreatening] danger on the Sabbath, according to the instructions of the professional doctor of that place.  If there is a doubt whether he needs to have Sabbath desecrated for him or not, and so if one doctor said to desecrate the Sabbath and one say he does not need it, they desecrate the Sabbath for him, because a doubt regarding lives pushes off the Sabbath.

Chapter 3



Chapter 4



Chapter 5

The kindling of a lamp on Shabbat is not optional that if one wants, one kindles and if one does not want, one does not kindle. And it is not a commandment that we are not obligated to pursue until one has done it, for example an eruv for courtyards or lifting (i.e. washing) the hands before eating; rather, it is an obligation. And both men and women are equally obligated that a lamp be kindled in their houses on Shabbat. Even if one does not have anything he will [be able to] eat, he begs at the doors [of neighbors] and takes oil and kindles the lamp since this is [included] in the rule of enjoyment on Shabbat. And one is obligated to bless before the kindling: "Blessed are You LORD our God, King of the universe who makes us holy with His commandments and commands us to kindle a Shabbat lamp" in the way that one blesses over all things which one is obligated [to do] by the words of the Sages.
It is permitted to use a Shabbat lamp. And this is [in the case] that the thing [one is doing] does not need much devotion. But if it is a thing that needs to be precise with regard to seeing, it is forbidden to use the light of the lamp for distinguishing - it is a decree lest one tilt [the lamp].
The one who kindles need to kindle while it is still day, before the sunset. And women are commanded regarding this matter more than men since they are found in the house, and they busy themselves with the labor of the house. And even so, a man needs to take care and check them on this and say to the members of the household on the eve of Shabbat before it gets dark, "Kindle the lamp!" If it is doubtful [whether] darkness has fallen and [whether] Shabbat has entered or [whether it has] not, one does not kindle.

Chapter 6

It is forbidden to say to a non-Jew to do labor for us on Shabbat despite that he was not commanded regarding Shabbat and despite that he said to him [to do the labor] before Shabbat and despite that there is no need for this labor other than [until] after Shabbat. And this matter is forbidden according to the words of the Rabbis so that Shabbat will not be light in their eyes and they will come to do [labor] themselves.
