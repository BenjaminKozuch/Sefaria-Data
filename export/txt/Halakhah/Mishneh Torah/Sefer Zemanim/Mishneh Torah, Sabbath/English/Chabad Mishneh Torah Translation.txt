Chapter 21

[Regarding the Sabbath,] the Torah [Exodus 23:12] states: "[On the seventh day,] you shall cease activity." [This implies] ceasing [even the performance of certain] activities that are not [included in the categories of the forbidden] labors.1  [The Torah left the definition of the scope of this commandment to] the Sages, [who] forbade many activities as sh'vut. Some activities are forbidden because they resemble the forbidden labors, while other activities are forbidden lest they lead one to commit a forbidden labor. These [activities] include the following







We may not ride on the back of animal on Shabbat. It is a decree lest one cut a branch to guide it. And we may not hang on an animal, and we do not go up [on an animal] while it is still daytime [before Shabbat] so that we may sit on it during Shabbat, and we do not lean on the side of animal, but [leaning on] the side of [something leaning on] the side is permitted. One who went up a tree on Shabbat unintentionally, it is permitted to come down, but intentionally, it is forbidden to come down. And on an animal, even intentionally, one comes down because of  [the prohibition of causing] pain to living creatures. An so, one unloads a burden from on top of an animal on Shabbat because of [the prohibition of causing] pain to living creatures.
