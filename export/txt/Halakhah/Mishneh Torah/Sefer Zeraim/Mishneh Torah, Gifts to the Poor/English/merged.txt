Chapter 7













The poor person who is in your family takes precedence over all others who are in need and the poor person of your house takes precedence over your town and the poor person of your town takes precedence over the poor of other towns as it is said: "...to your brother, to your poor, and to your needy in your land" (Deuteronomy 15:11)

Chapter 8










Redeeming captives takes precedence over feeding and clothing the poor. And there is no commandment as great as redeeming captives, for a captive is among the hungry, thirsty, naked, and is in mortal danger. And one who averts one eyes from redeeming him/her violates, "You shall not harden your heart, and you shall not shut your hand," and, "Do not stand by your brother's blood," and "You shall not work him with hard labor before your eyes," and has neglected the commandment, "You shall surely open your hand to him," and the commandment, "And your brother shall live with you," "And you shall love your fellow as yourself," "Save those who are take to death," and many like these. And there is no great commandment like redemption of captives.






...If there were many poor people to give charity to or many captives to redeem and there is not enough in the [public] purse to provide for all, clothe or redeem them all, a Kohen comes before a Levi and a Levi before a Yisrael and a Yisrael before a Halal and a Halal before a Shtuki and a Shtuki before an Asufi and an Asufi before a Mamzer and a Mamzer before a Natin and a Natin before a convert - since the Natin was raised with us in holiness - and a convert comes before a released slave since he [the released slave] was among the cursed.

Chapter 9



Chapter 10

Whoever gives money to the poor with a negative attitude and a down trodden face, even if one gives a thousand gold Dinars, looses their merit.
