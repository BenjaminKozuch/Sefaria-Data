Chapter 1



















Tefillin and Mezuzot cannot be written except for in Assyrian script. And for Torah scrolls, they allowed it to be written also in Greek, but this Greek language has already disappeared from the world and been lost, so today all three may only be written in Assyrian script. And he must be careful in their writing that two letters not stick together, for any letter that is not surrounded by parchment on all four sides is disqualified. And any letter that a child who is not wise, nor a fool, cannot read is disqualified. Therefore, he must be careful with forming the letters that a yud not look like a vav, nor a vav a yud, nor a kaf a bet, nor a bet a kaf, nor a dalet a reish, nor a reish a dalet, and the like, until the reader will not have trouble.

Chapter 6









A toilet, a bath house, a mikveh, and a tannery and those like them, are exempt from a mezuzah because they are not used as a dignified dwelling.  A sukkah on Sukkot and a house on a boat are exempt from having a mezuzah because they are not used as fixed dwellings.  Two booths of potters, one inside the other, the outer one is exempt from the mezuzah because it is not fixed.  Stores in the market are exempt because they are not fixed as dwellings.



People must be very careful about the mitzvah of mezzzah because it is an obligation on everyone at all times, so that any time they go out or come in, they will brush against the unity of the name of the Holy Blessed One and remember God's love and wake up from their sleep and errors in the futilities of daily life and know that there is nothing that lasts forever except the knowledge of the Rock of Ages. And they will then immediately return to their true knowledge and and walk on the right path. The sages said: anyone who has tefillin on their head and arm, and tzitzit on their clothing, and a mezuzah on their doorpost is safe from sin, for they have so many reminders, and they are the angels that save people from sin, as it is written, "The angel of the LORD camps around those who fear God and rescues them." (Ps 34:7)
