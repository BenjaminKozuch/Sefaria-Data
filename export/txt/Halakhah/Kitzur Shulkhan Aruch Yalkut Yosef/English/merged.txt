Chelek 1



Siman 1

We learned in Masechet Avot (Pirkei Avot 5:20) "Be bold like a leopard, light like an eagle, fleeting like a deer, and mightly like a lion to do the wish of your Father in Heaven." And they learned from here four rules in serving Hashem "be bold like a leopard" when someone does a Miswa they shouldn't be embarrassed from people who mock him. "Light like an eagel" to close his eyes from seeing evil because the eyes are the instigators of the sin. "Fleeting like a deer" the feet should run to good deeds. "Mightly like a lion" this is a overpowering over the evil inclination. Therefor one should fight like a lion to stand in the morning to serve Hashem, like you awaken the day. No matter what one shouldn't be late on "Zeman Tefila" or "Zeman Keriat Shema". [The main fighting should be in the heart to fight against the evil inclination. Like someone fighting against his enemy to knock him down. This is how one should fight is evil inclination]. (Yalkut Yosef, Hashkamat HaBoker pg. 57).
One should be careful to be modest when he dresses or undresses, and one shouldn't say "Behold I am in hidden rooms 'who can see me?' because Hashem's presence fills the entire universe. A person who usually dresses modest should be careful not to reveal [skin] out of respect for Hashem. When one arises he should be very swift to dress himself. A child who understands things should be taught from a young age to dress himself modestly. (Yalkut Yosef, Hashkamat HaBoker pg. 207).
One must arise early in the morning so that there is sufficient time to prepare oneself to pray with a congregation and in cleanliness, so as to not miss the time of prayer. And it was customary in a number of Jewish communities, that the Shamash (attendant of the community or synagogue) would go [around the neighborhood] each morning and knock on door[s] or window[s] to awaken all those sleeping for prayers and to serve Hashem (God). [Yalkut Yosef, laws of Hashkamat Haboker, edition (year) 5764 pg 63].

Siman 2

It is worthy and good for every G-d fearer to be troubled and worried by the destruction of the Bet Hamikdash and the exile of the Shekhinah, as it says, "Get up and sing in the night, at the beginning of the watches." And just like the Holy One, Blessed be He laments at that time, and says, "Woe to me that I destroyed my house..." like this for everyone who G-d touched his heart to lament in the middle of the night about the destruction, and on the spreading of Israel through the nations, and the exile of the Torah, and the killing of the righteous. And everybody who is able to wake up in the middle of the night, he should do it and say "Tikkun Hasot". And also, if you remain awake until the middle of the night, try not to sleep until you say Tikkun Hasot, to join with the pain of the Shekhinah in exile. However, when you pray and learn Torah you should be happy. And in any case, if you cry during the prayer, you prayer is accepted more.

The entire congregation is required to recite the haftarah quietly together with the one leading the congregation. [Yalkut Yosef, Shabbat A, pg 352].


On a shabbat when a double-portion is read, the haftara of the second portion is recited, as that is the portion that concludes the [Torah] reading.




Siman 281

Even though a person listens to the entire Torah reading every Shabbat from the leader of the congregation, he must read it to himself, the verses twice and a translation once. And anyone who completes his [weekly] Torah portion [study] with the congregation [is blessed with] lengthy days and years. And also, one who is engrossed in the study of Torah the entire day, and his Torah study is his profession, may not withdraw from reading the weekly Torah portion with the congregation. He must read the portion, the verses twice and the translation once. And if one is engrossed in Torah to the point that involves the recording of insights and rulings, he is permitted to read on Friday night, the verses twice and the translation once. [Yalkut Yosef, Shabbat Vol.1 pg 354].
