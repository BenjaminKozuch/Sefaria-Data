Siman 1

1. Judah ben Teimah says, "Be strong as a tiger, easy as an eagle (gliding), fast as a deer and heroic like a lion to do the will of your Father in Heaven." He lays out these specific four things in the service of the Blessed Creator.  He begins with 1) "strong like a tiger," for it is a great rule in the service of the Divine, as at times one wishes to do some command, and he is prevented from doing so by other people who scoff at him.  Therefore be careful to persevere against the scoffers, and don't allow them to impede you from performing a command.  Thus R' Yochanan ben Zakkai said to his students, "May it be God's will that your fear of Heaven be as great as your fear of other people."  Similarly he said regarding shame, that "sometimes one is ashamed before those who are greater than oneself more than he is ashamed before the blessed Creator." Thus be careful to harden your mien against the scoffers and do not be ashamed.  Thus said David the servant of God, "And I will speak in your defense against kings and I will not be ashamed."  Even as he was pursued and fled before the non-Jews he was strengthened by his Torah and studied, even though they were laughing at him.  2) He says "easy like the eagle," against the evil eye, ...

And one should wash his hands clean and bless, "Blessed are you Adonai, our God, King of the universe, that has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us regarding the washing of hands." One should be meticulous to pour [water] on them (i.e. the hands) three times because of the evil spirit that rests upon the hands, before they are washed, and does not leave until [water] is poured upon them three times. Therefore, before one's hands are washed, one must refrain from touching the mouth, the nose, the ears, and the eyes with one's hand, as the evil spirit rests upon them. And if one does not have water, one should wipe his hands on a stone or anything that cleans, and bless, ""Blessed are you Adonai, our God, King of the universe, that has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us regarding the cleanliness of hands."

All kinds of clothing are obligated in tzitzit. Tzitzit made of wool or of linen fulfill [this mitzvah] for [garments made of] any kind of fabric, but [tzitzit made from] any other kind of fabric, like silk or cotton do not fulfill [this mitzvah] unless [the fabric of] the tzitzit match the fabric of the garment. 
The Rambam wrote that one must make the tzitzit the same color as the tallit: i.e. if the tallit is red, the tzitzit should be red, and if the tallit is green, the tzitzit should be green. Rashi agrees with this. Rabbi Yehuda explained that this is not necessary.

All who are exempt from shma, e.g., those who are involved in a mitzvah or in the preparation for a mitzvah, are exempt from prayer.  In addition, replacement pall-bearers that are not immediately needed are exempt from prayer even though they are obligated in recitation of the shma.  Women and slaves are obligated in [prayer].

And he should be cautious to make a fine lamp, as R. Huna said: One who is regular [to light] a Shabbat lamp, to strive to perform this, and to make it attractive, will have sons who are scholars. And there are those who make two wicks, one to correspond with "Remember" and one to correspond with "Observe." But if he cannot afford to buy a lamp for Shabbat and a lamp for Hannukah, Shabbat takes priority. Similarly if he cannot afford to buy a candle and wine for Kiddush, the candle takes priority because of domestic tranquility, for there is no domestic tranquility without a lamp. And he should not hurry to light it while the day is still long, for then it won't be known that he lights it for the honor of Shabbat. Nor should he light late. And when he lights he blesses: Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the universe who has sancitified us with his commandments and commanded us to light the Sabbath lamp. Both men and women are commanded to light this, but women are more commanded than men, as it says in the Midrash: Since she extinguished the lamp of the world, meaning she caused the death of the first human. And the Rambam explains [that women are more obligated] because they are found at home and they take care of household needs. And there are those who says that we should not recite a blessing over it, and they explain that if the lamp was already lit he need not extinguish it in order to go back and light it again, nor need he light another lamp. But this is not a good reason, for with regard to covering the blood [of a bird or wild animal that was slaughtered] we taught: If the wind covered [the blood] he need not go back and cover it again, and nevertheless we bless the covering. Furthermore, Rabbenu Tam said that if it was already lit he must extinguish it and go back and light it again. For an elder said: We have taught: As long as he doesn't do it too early or too late. And so too wrote Rav Amram: One who lights the Shabbat candle blesses. And so too wrote the Halakhot Gedolot that the acceptance of Shabbat is dependent upon the lighting of the candle, for once he has lit the Shabbat candle Shabbat has begun for him. And for this reason he wrote that one must first light the Hannukah lamp before the Shabbat candle for if he does Shabbat first, he cannot afterwards light the Hannukah candle. But the Tosafot wrote that [the beginning of Shabbat] is not dependent on the lighting of the lamp for even after he lights, Shabbat has not begun for him. Rather it is dependent on the maariv prayer, for Shabbat begins once he has prayed maariv.

It is a mitzvah incumbent on every Jewish man to write a Torah scroll, and it is extremely important to seek [an opportunity] to perform it as Rabbi Joshua ben Levi says,  "one who buys a [ready made] Torah Scroll is like one who grabs a mitzvah in the market place." [On the other hand] One who writes it himself or corrects even one letter is counted as if he received it directly from Mt. Sinai. It goes without saying that he shouldn't sell his Torah, even if he has many, and it is even forbidden to sell an old scroll in order to buy a new one, or even to buy food. However it is permitted to sell a Torah scroll in order to learn Torah or to get married if he has nothing else to sell.
