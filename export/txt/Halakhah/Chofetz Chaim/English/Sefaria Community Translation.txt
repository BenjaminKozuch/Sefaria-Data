Article 7

And from this we can understand that lashon hara is certainly forbidden in an  instance where only one's personal honor is at stake. As when one is sitting in a company of   men and has no way of avoiding them, and they are speaking of things which are forbidden   according to the din. If he sits in silence and in no way abets them in their talk, he will be   regarded as "crazy." Of this and all such things, Chazal have said (Eduyoth 5:6): "Better that   a man be called 'a fool' all of his days rather than be wicked one moment before the Lrd." He   must harness all of his powers at that moment to withstand the trial, and [if he does so], he   may be completely confident that his reward for this from the Blessed Lrd will be without   end. As Chazal have stated (Avoth 5:23): "According to the strain is the reward." And, in   Avoth d'R. Nathan: "One time with strain for a hundred times without strain." (That is, the   reward for the performance of a mitzvah or the abstention from an issur, which entails strain,   is a hundredfold more than for that of the same kind, which entails no strain.) And to such a   time [of trial as the above] there certainly applies the statement of Chazal in the Midrash:   "For every moment that one 'muzzles' his mouth, he attains to such secreted light that no   angel or [Divine] creature can conceive of." (As to how one should conduct himself in   respect to reproof and listening if one is "caught" in such an evil company as this one, see   below Principle VI, sections 4-6, and above, in the introduction to the negative   commandments, section 16.)

Article 1



Article 2

As to there being found a heter [a halachic permit] in the words of Chazal to speak  it before three, this applies to something which is not an absolute taint and which can be   understood in two ways. It is well known that such things depend on how they are said. It is   such a thing that Chazal permitted to say in the presence of three, the rationale being that   since he says it before three, he knows for a certainty that these things will come to his [the   object's] ears (for "your friend has a friend, etc."). The speaker, therefore, heeds himself in   speaking, that what he says will not be understood negatively.   (Let one illustration serve for all cases of the same kind. If one is asked: "Where is fire   found?" and he answers: "You can find it there, where they always cook flesh and fish." This   can be understood according to how it is said at the time. If he wishes he can say it in such a   tone that contains no taint against his friend. For in truth, there is sometimes no fault in this.   It may be that he has a large family and that the Holy One Blessed be He has blessed him   with wealth, or that he is an innkeeper or the like, and that when he [the speaker] is asked   where fire is to be found, he answers [quite appropriately] that there is no fire to be found   now except in that house, where they always cook, etc. All of these things in the category of   the "dust" of lashon hara depend upon how they are expressed at the time. But if the "tone"  of his voice and movements is that he [the proprietor of the house or the inn] overindulges in   feasting, even though this is not an absolute taint, Chazal has termed it the "dust" of lashon   hara, and it is forbidden to say it even in the presence of three.)
