Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a



Line 1

There are places that do not use the word "hen (they)," as is the case here, as well as in the Gemara regarding "There are 13 main categories of damages" and in the case of "There are 4... (please some amend translation of this case)."  And there are places that do use the word "hen" as in the case of "There are for guardians" and "There are 4 new years."

The previous person removed it. - The explanation of Rav Alfas of Ravah and goes with his reasoning, that hat he says he is obligated in Garmi (Later on page 98.) And to the Ree it appears that in this case it is Grama of damages  and everybody agreed he is exempt.

<b>Our mishna - One who injures: "The one who strikes an animal... shall pay for it..." - juxtaposed to it is "If a man gives.": </b> It appears to Rabbi Yitzchak that we do not include [the words], "juxtaposed to it is" - since, behold, it did not expound on the basis of juxtaposed phrases (<i>smukhin</i>), but [rather] on the basis of a textual connection (<i>gezera shava</i>), as it says later, "we are saying [a scriptural connection between] "strike" and "strike." And it also states later, "And since it is written, 'You shall not take ransom,' why do I need [the (scriptural) connection between] 'strike' and 'strike?'" [From this,] it is implied that it is a scriptural connection and not juxtaposed phrases. And also when it challenges nearby, "Why did you see to learn it from, 'Whoever strikes an animal;' let it be learned from, 'Whoever strikes a man'" - [if the teaching was really based upon juxtaposition,] what is the difficulty; is it not based upon juxtaposed phrases, and "Whoever strikes a man" is not juxtaposed to "If a man gives!" And if you will ask, and since it learned it from a scriptural connection [and not from] juxtaposed phrases, why was it forced to bring the verse of "The one who mortally strikes an animal shall make it good," and discard the verse of  "Whoever strikes an animal" that it brought above; one can answer that "Whoever strikes an animal" was needed for the teacher of the House of Hezkiah - and for the one that does not [agree with that teacher], he expounds [it] in the beginning of [the chapter called] Hanechenakin (Sanhedrin 84b), "Just like 'Whoever strikes an animal' for medicinal purposes is exempt, etc." And also (another answer) is that once it retracted "Whoever strikes a man," which is with the death penalty, it retracted it completely. And [instead] it took this verse of "The one who mortally strikes an animal" which is juxtaposed to ""If a man gives a blemish." And according to this, we are able to include [the words], "juxtaposed to it is" - since because it is juxtaposed to [the other verse], it took this verse, but not because of [the exegetical tool of] juxtaposed phrases.
