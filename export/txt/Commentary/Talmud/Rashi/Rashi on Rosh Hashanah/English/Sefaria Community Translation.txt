<b>The Patriarchs were born:</b> Abraham and Jacob.
Rabbi Yehoshua says: 
In Nisan the world was created, in Nisan the Patriarchs were born, in Nisan the Patriarchs died, on Passover Isaac was born, on Rosh HaShanah Sarah, Rachel, and Hannah were remembered, on Rosh HaShanah Joseph left prison, on Rosh HaShanah slavery was lifted from our forefathers in Egypt, in Nissan they were redeemed, and in Nisan they will be redeemed in the future.
