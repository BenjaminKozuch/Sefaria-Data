Chapter 1



Mishna 1

1) Moses received the Torah from Sinai -- I say, according to the fact that this tractate was not based on the explanation that a commandment from the commandments of the Torah, as are the remaining tractates of the Mishna, rather all ethics and principles, and the sages of the nations of the world, also the author of the books like the ones who fabricated from its core in ethical ways however, men behaved with their friends?, therefore the author began with this tractate Moses received the Torah from Sinai, to say to you that the principles and the ethics that this tractate did not fabricate the sages of the Mishna counter to them, but rather this is what was said at Sinai.

Mishna 1
