AND DAVID sacrificed his own honor for the honor of Hashem in three ways:
A) In his body, that HE DANCED and ran WITH ALL HIS MIGHT BEFORE THE ARK OF HASHEM; B) in his dress, that he was WEARING A LINEN EPHOD, like the clothing of priests and servants of Hashem, and not the clothing of a king, so as not to show his pride before Hashem; and in these two, David was isolated from the people, for because of his status, he had to show his submission before the creator, as it is written, "The king, once having bowed, does not straighten" (BT Brachot 34b).  And on this, it is written AND DAVID, C) that all of Israel joined with him, as it is written, AND DAVID AND ALL OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL BROUGHT UP THE ARK OF HASHEM, WITH TRUMPET-SOUNDS AND THE CALL OF THE SHOFAR, to awaken happiness and joy.

David arose after separating from the Ark of God, and he arrived at the Mount of Olives, for there he separated from God's city and began to cry and cover his head and remove his sandals like a mourner.
