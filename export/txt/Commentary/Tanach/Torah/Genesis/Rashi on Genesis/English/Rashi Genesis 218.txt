Verse 18

It is not good: Lest the people say that there are two realms -  Hashem, he is in the heavens and his is alone without a partner; and man he is in the earthly realm and he also does not have a partner. 

A helpmate opposite him: If the man merits it, then his helper will be an ezer - a helper! but if he does not merit it, then she will be knegdo him - opposite him!
