Chapter 1



Verse 1

<b><i>Bereshit</i></b> - at the beginning of time. This refers to the first, indivisible moment, before which there was no time.
<b><i>Bara</i></b> - He made nothing into something. And regarding this, time doesn't apply at all!
<b><i>E-lohim</i></b> - Behold, the word <i>E-loah</i> indicates triumphant/eternal. This is in relation to the demons, who are mortal like human beings, as our Masters, may their memory be a blessing, testified: "It says, 'to the non-<i>E-loah</i> demons' (Devarim 32:7), while regarding G-d, may He be blessed, it said, <i>E-loah</i>, for He is absolutely eternal, and they said, "And he abandoned the the Eternal Who created him" (Devarim 32:15). And it says regarding Him <i>E-lohim</i>, a plural form, to indicate that He is the form of all forms, eternal and otherwise, as it says, "the fullness of the earth is His Glory", for there is no existance other than Him, other than that which emanates from His Existence, and there will not exist any existence other than His Existence, as it says, "and you give life to all of them" (Nehemiah 9:6). Now, in the sense of similarity, anything separated from the material realm may be called <i>Elohim</i>. Expert judges are called <i>Elohim</i>, when they judge employing the image of G-d. Now to indicate the supremity of His Eternity, from which emanate all other entities separated from the material, He is called "G-d of gods" ( <i>E-loahei HaElohim</i>).
<b><i>et Hashamayim</i></b> - Behold, the word <i>sham</i> (there) indicates a distant place. And all masculine plural endings - <i>im</i> - preceded by a penultimate-accented <i>patach</i> vowel indicates duality. Therefore, <i>shamayim</i> indicates a distant entity (relative to us), equally distant on all sides. This cannot occur except with an encompassing, perfectly round sphere. It is therefore saying that He created this entity which is equidistant from us in all directions - this is the (heavenly) sphere. Therefore it did NOT say "He created heavens", for it is not speaking from His perspective, but relative to our situation.
ואת הארץ, and the center which is orbited by the planet.


Verse 2

"And the earth was <i>tohu</i> and <i>bohu</i> - and that same earth that was created then, was comprised of a primordial matter called <i>tohu</i> and a primorial form called <i>bohu</i>, for seeing as how it was not apropriate for there to be a first element without a single form, this form was the first of all compound discernable forms.  Thereby, it is explained that the primordial matter was created <i>ex nihilo</i> and the matter of that first compound was called <i>tohu</i> since from its own perspective it was merely potentially [existant], not actually existant, as it says, (regarding false gods) "for they are <i>tohu</i>, that is to say, without actual existance, rather merely imaginary. Now the form imposed on that first compound was called <i>bohu</i>, for it was "in <i>tohu</i>" that it was actually present. And Scripture states "stones of <i>bohu</i> - the subject that doesn't linger with its form any calculable time, like what happened with the subject of the first form, which immediately took one the forms of interchanging elements.
"And darkness" - this is the dark atmosphere which emanated from the first compound, and it was "upon the face of the deep" - on the face of the two nether elements, which where also emanated from the first compound, and which emcompassed one another.
"And a spirit of G-d" - that which moves the sphere, called "spirit", as it is said, "He makes the spirits His messangers" (Tehilim 104:4)
"hovering over the waters" - they moved the darkened atmosphere over the face of the waters which encompassed then the earth element. And indeed it was that the portion of it adjoining the sphere was inflamed by the sphere's motion - that is elemental fire. The portion of it close to the water acquired coldness from the water, except for a small portion thereof which was heated incidentally by a reversal of the sparks from the luminous luminaries. 

Verse 3

"Let there be light" - this is the light of the seven days [i.e., <i>Or HaGanuz</i>], which was for the use of those created without seed, and it will be [again] in the future, as the words of the Sages (may their memories be a blessing) Chagigah 12a: it will then be for that which is the future will bring forth baked treats and fine clothing without [needing] the power of seed.

Verse 4

"And G-d say that the light was good" - and it was, for G-d saw and chose that it exist, for the sake of the ultimate purpose - Goodness, for which He created it [the light] via His activating knowledge.
"And G-d divided between the light and the the darkness" - on those days during which the primeval light prevailed there were periods of light and periods of darkness without [need for] the power of the rotations of a [heavenly] sphere, rather though Divine Will [alone], for He divided between the time of light and the time of darkness.

Verse 5

"And G-d called the light 'day'" - even though there was not yet "time" [per se], the light and the darkness behaved in the fashion that they behave in time by us,  and we call each now by the name "day" or "night".
"And it was evening and it was morning" - even though He separated the light and the darkness so that they would prevail during separate, alternating periods with [need for] rotation of a [heavenly] sphere, He separated them gradually, in such a manner that there was between them a time of "evening" before the onset of night, and a time of "morning" before the onset of day.

Verse 6

"Let there be a firmament in the midst of the water" -  let there be a [manifestation of] nature in the midst of elemental water similar to a sphere in their midst all around, separating by form part of them [i.e., the elemental waters] from the other part of them, in such a fashion that the upper part of the waters, near the [upper] atmosphere [lit.: air], would turn into vapor. Now behold, thereby, they [the waters] necessarily ascended to some boundary in the elemental air, and the air necessarily was subject to some transformation which made a place for a portion which was converted to vapor, and it expanded to a place much great in volume than its original place.

Verse 7

"And G-d made the firmament" - and it was that when some of the elemental water was removed from under that part of the waters which became vaporous in nature, as it was when He said, "let the waters be gathered from beneath the heavens" Genesis 1:9, it was fit that the vaporous part would descend to that same place from which the that [non-vaporous portion of] waters was removed. But He made it such that that "firmament" that separates would have the power to stop and prevent the vaporous portion from descending - that's the "waters which are above the firmament", such that the transformed atmospheric portion would descend, while the vaporous would remain in its original place. Because of this, when the the moist vapor reaches it [i.e., the firmament], it condenses and gives rise to rain, snow and hail. As they condense they descend, as it is said, "at the sound of His placing an abundance of water in the heavens" Jeremiah 10:13. - what it wanted by saying "heavens": the  firmament which condenses the atmospheric part [of the waters], as it is said "And G-d called the firmament "heavens" Genesis 1:8. Now when the cloudy, excited vapor arrives there [at the firmament], it generates thunder and lightning, and it is said: "He lifts up clouds from the ends of the earth, thunder from the rain He makes" [continuation of verse quoted previously from Jeremiah]. Now, seeing as how some of the heavier watery element is above the lighter air, which from our perspectives is against their nature - this without doubt indicates the action of an volitional actor, intended such an outcome, as it is said, "the work of His hands shall the firmament declare" Psalms 19:2
"and it was so" - it remained thus against its nature.

Verse 8

"And G-d called the firmament 'heavens'" - since the heavenly actions reach us though its means, as it says, "and G-d placed them in the firmament of the heavens to illuminate upon the earth, and to have dominion over day and night and to distinguish... Genesis 1:17-18

Verse 9

"Let the waters gather" - not that they dried up, as many have thought, saying that the the process of drying up of the exposed portion of the earth happened through the power of the heavenly array, but rather that He commanded that they [the waters] be gathered in one place and that they not go past it, for indeed, they are above the earth yet they do not fall upon it, as one's senses can testify, as it is said, "You placed a boundary that they not go past, that they not return to cover the earth Psalms 104:9

Verse 10

"and G-d called the dry land - 'land'" - He called a part by the name of the whole, for indeed, this portion was more the intentional root that any [of the rest], as it says, "He created it for dwelling " Isaiah 45:18.
"and G-d saw that it was good" - He wanted it thus because of the goal which is: the intended Goodness

Verse 11

“Grass” – [various] species of grasses for animal consumption, as it is said: “For the pastures of the desert have become grassy" [said as reassurance to the animals"]. Joel 2:22
“Grass bearing seed” – for human consumption.
“Fruit-trees making fruit according to its species” – for a mongrel cannot reproduce.
“And it was so” – It was established thus, without any excess or lack, in a manner such that if a plants would happen to be comprised of two species, it will not reproduce.

Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14

“Let there be luminaries in the firmament of heaven” – in that same firmament created on the second day, let there be the shining of the luminaries; there it will become magnified and adapted to act in the lower realms according to everything stated in this passage, as can be seen with our own senses, that the light of a spark is magnified when it passes through clear water.

Verse 15

"to illuminate upon the earth" - that light adapted appropriately for its dwellers should come upon it [i.e., the earth] from the luminaries.
"and it was so" - the necessary adaptation [of the light] was established thus at His command.

Verse 16

“and he make….and he placed.. to illuminate….to rule… to separate… that it was good” – regarding the luminaries and the other stars it said, “and He made” since they were an integral part of the spheres and the heavens, and it’s already told of their making (Genesis 1:1) – that’s why it doesn’t mention regarding them “creation”, rather “making” – namely, that He produced them from parts of the spheres, in a ball-like shape and with a luminous character.
“that it was good” – that is to say, He intended by this toward goodness, which is the proper goal for His actions.

Verse 17



Verse 18

“And to rule by day and by night” – to renew beings in the lower worlds – and they were need then due to that First Light for the creation of animals which are more substantial (<i>nichbadim</i>) than plants.
“And to distinguish between day and night” – to distinguish in the lower worlds, by means of their rising and setting, between the time of light, called “day” and the time of darkness, called “night”, as it said above, “to distinguish between day and night” (Genesis 1:14)

Verse 19



Verse 20

“flying over the earth, over the face of the firmament of heaven” – to cleanse the earth’s atmosphere for its dwellers from any excess moisture precipitated from the firmament, created on the second day, due to the spark active in it.

Verse 21

“And G-d created the crocodiles” – the generative power imbued it the water was not adequate to produce the first crocodiles without seed, until He created power adequate for this [task].

Verse 22

“And G-d blessed them” – for the goal [intended] for them would not be achieved unless they would be many.

Verse 23



Verse 24

“let the earth bring forth living souls” – additional vitality, greater than [that of] growing things.
“and it was so” – without excess or lack, for should there have been a mongrel from two species, it would not have reproduced.

Verse 25

“And G-d made the beasts of the earth according to their kind” – He gave to each species senses and capacities in accordance with what was necessary for that species.

Verse 26

"and G-d said 'Let us make'..." - He then granted the power to His entourage to imbue the image in a subject prepared for [recieving] it.
"man" - one of the species of 'living souls' which I created whose name is 'man', as it says, "and man became a living soul" (Genesis 2:7)
"in our image" - that is, an eternal, intelligent entity. Thereby did G-d, may He be blessed, open an opening with His Torah, to acquired knowledge of the separate [i.e., non-material] entities though knowing our own souls.
"after our likeness" - in regards to action and behavior, that he would resemble to an extent the hosts on high, in that they act with knowledge and awareness. However, their [i.e., the heavenly hosts] actions are not freely chosen, and in that way, man does not resemble them. And to an extent, he would resemble G-d, may He be blessed, Who acts with free choice. However, the choice of G-d, may He be blessed, is always for the good, not so with human choice. With all of this, the Divine [choice] is [carried out] in a much more substantial fashion than human choice. Therefore it says, "after our image" - <b>like</b> our image, and not truly <b>in</b> our image.

Verse 27

"in the image of G-d" - behold, the word G-d (<i>E-lohim</i>) is said by way of comparison with any entity which is intelligent in actuality, perfect/whole, non-material and therefore necessarily eternal. Therefor it [the word] is said regarding G-d, may He be blessed, and regarding His angels, and similarly it is said regarding judges in respect to that intelligent element that is fitting for them. Indeed, seeing that even though human intelligence is acquired without any material tools, and extends over abstract notions, and over future [i.e., hypothetical situation], and  is not weakened by extensive intellectual activity, nor in old age, but rather gains strength, and all of these [features] make it clear that it is doubtlessly non-material, for indeed, the opposite of all these befall the bodily, material powers, nevertheless, before he gains wisdom [lit. - ponders], being then lacking in all the perfections awaiting him, he is <b>not</b> called g0d, rather he merely called "in the image of G-d" until he acquires perfections, especially that wisdom through which he acquires love and awe of G-d and, for then he will be an fully-realized intelligent entity, perfect, non-material, and then he will be necessarily eternal, and will continue to exist also after the death of the body. Now since it is the choice of man whether to acquire this perfection through his effort to ponder the wisdom mentioned previously, it will therefore become clear that when he prevents himself from this, his intellectual potential will remain merely a potentiality, lacking in all actualized perfection, like it was from the beginning, and he will amount to nothing and be lost, as it says, "man is honored, but if he will not understand, he is compared to mere beasts" (Psalms 49:21). G-d, may He be blessed, taught all of this with  two words, "in the image of G-d".

Verse 28

"and subdue it" - that you should be protected by your intelligence, and you should prevent the animals from entering [i.e., penetrating] into your realm, and you shall rule over them.
"and rule" - using traps and nets to subjugate them to your service.

Verse 29

"behold, I have given to you" - for human consumption.

Verse 30

"and for all the animals of the earth" - but for all the [wild] animals of the earth and for the domesticated animals I have given all vegetables for food. [These are] types of grasses which do not propagate by seed.

Verse 31

"everthing that He had made and behold, it was very g00d!" - the goal of existence as a whole is very much better that the individual  goals which are intended [to lead] to it.
"the sixth day" - the first [sixth day] which is the beginning of every sixth day, on which all deeds will be completed in order to cease [i.e., rest] on Shabbat, as it says, "and you shall do all your work, and on the seventh day, Shabbat" (Exodus 20:9-10)

Chapter 2



Verse 1

 ויכלו, when all the phenomena intended to comprise the physical universe had materialised 

Verse 2

ויכל אלוקים ביום השביעי, at the beginning of the seventh “day,” a moment which is indivisible from the time frame which follows, so that both the six previous “days” were an entity in themselves, and the seventh day was a totally self-contained entity. Our sages in Bereshit Rabbah 10,9 describe G’d as knowing the precise moment between the sixth and seventh day and describe it as “thin as a hair’s breadth.” [I believe the problem confronting the sages was the statement that G’d had completed all His work in the six days, and yet the Torah speaks of Him completing, ויכל, His work on the ”seventh” day, something that appears to be a contradiction to the former statement. Ed.] 
וישבות ביום השביעי, G’d’s inactivity on the seventh day set it apart from the previous six days.


Verse 3

ויברך אלוקים את יום השביעי, this refers not only to the first Sabbath but to all subsequent Sabbath days. G’d endowed every Sabbath with this blessing so that it would more readily accommodate the additional “soul” He grants Jews on that day. Job 33,30 describes this phenomenon as לאור באור החיים, “designed that he may bask in the light of life.” Our sages (Beytzah 16) state that the words שבת וינפש in Exodus 31,17 refer to the loss of this additional soul at the end of the Sabbath. 

Verse 4

אלה תולדות השמים והארץ בהבראם. These are the plants and the living creatures which had been the potential derivatives of heaven and earth already at the time when heaven and earth were first created. The potential ability for heaven and earth to produce the inhabitants of their respective domains was inherent in their respective composition from the first moment of their existence. When the Torah, in its very first verse, wrote the words את השמים and את הארץ, this was already an allusion to the additional factors which had been created together with heaven and earth, i.e. their ability to produce their respective derivatives.
ביום עשות ה' אלוקים ארץ ושמים, this potential was translated into an actual only on the day when G’d completed עשות, i.e. arranged in detail how these derivatives were to function and where and when. This occurred after the six “days” of creative activity. Only when that stage had been reached was G’d referred to in the Torah by His full name, i.e. ה' אלוקים.


Verse 5

טרם יהיה בארץ, these words emphasise that although all phenomena had been created, this referred to their potential, not to their functioning as they do nowadays. כל עשב השדה, had not yet sprouted,
כי לא המטיר, for G’d had not yet made it rain in such a fashion that it enabled the latent power of these plants to fully develop.


Verse 6

ואד יעלה מן הארץ, on the day they were completed, i.e. at the end of the sixth “day” a vapour rose from the earth equivalent to beneficial dew which irrigated the earth and enabled it to bring forth further vegetation without the help of rain or man’s labour.

Verse 7

וייצר ה' אלוקים, the animals had not rated involvement of both attributes of G’d in their creation and formation. Not only that, but in order to create man G’d had used עפר מן האדמה, the choicest of the dust available on earth. Moreover,
ויפח באפיו נשמת חיים, G’d personally blew a soul of life into man, a life force which had been readied to absorb what was previously called צלם אלוקים, “the image of G’d.” This has been attested to in Job 32,8 ונשמת שדי תבינם,”by means of the breath of the attribute of Shaddai You endowed them with understanding.” At any rate, ויהי האדם לנפש חיה, man had remained a living creature  (similar to the animals) until You equipped him with a divine-like tzelem and demut.


Verse 8

אשר יצר, after G’d had created man in a manner appropriate to his superior status on earth, He placed him in Gan Eden, a location which was suitable to equip him with the צלם אלוקים, the divine image, enabling him to also fulfill the intellectual tasks involving the air and food in the garden.

Verse 9

ויצמח, G‘d made the food necessary for Adam sprout forth. The verse illustrates with what ease Adam could secure his requirements in Gan Eden.
נחמד למראה, looking at these trees resulted In the viewer experiencing intellectual stimulation both of his heart and his brain. He would thus be capable of “digesting” the additional intellectual insights granted him by G’d. Compare Kings II 3,15 ותהי עליו יד ה', “Elisha had now been endowed by G’d’s generosity.” [a reference to the additional spiritual insights he had asked from his mentor Elijah prior to the latter ascending to heaven. Ed.]
ועץ הדעת, a tree whose fruit results in those who eat from it gaining greater understanding of the relationship of good and evil. The word דעת, which appears here for the first time, helps us understand Genesis 4,1 והאדם ידע את חוה אשתו. Without this verse we would have been puzzled by the Torah telling us something that was so obvious. Who does not “know” his wife, especially when he had described her as “bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh!” (2,23) In our verse we are told that the words ידע, דעת do not primarily refer to factual knowledge but to conceptual knowledge. This also helps us to understand why relatives, as in Ruth 2,1 are referred to as מודע לאישה, “someone whom her late husband had been intimate with, had been related to by blood.” It is normal for blood relations to be concerned with the physical and emotional needs of their kin. (compare Proverbs 17,17.)
טוב ורע, to choose that which appeared as appealing to the senses even though it would prove harmful, and to despise anything which did not appeal to his senses although he knew it to be useful to him.


Verse 10

ונהר יוצא מעדן, the Torah explains that Adam’s work did not entail anything strenuous, such a carrying pails of water, or such as getting wet in the rain.

Verse 11

שם אחד פישון, the Torah reveals the name of the river to its credit, seeing that it irrigated a garden it had not known. The “tributaries” branching off from this river are also familiar to us, as all of them provide a vital supply of fresh water in populated areas of the earth. Their waters contribute greatly to making vegetation grow on earth.

Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15

לעבדה, a reference to perfecting his own personality, that which was supplied by G’d in an as yet unrefined state, the one called נשמת חיים. [the author searched to justify the use of the feminine mode in the word לעבדה and related it to נשמה, soul, a noun which is feminine and requires further refinement, just like שיר and שירה which both mean song, the latter, in the feminine mode being unrefined when compared to the former. Compare its use in the haggadah shel Pessach. Ed.]
ולשמרה, eating the fruit of the garden would ensure that man’s natural juices would not dry up. Man is equipped with natural heat, and if not supplied with the proper kind of nourishment he may dehydrate. The excellent fruit of the trees of the garden would replenish loss of moisture through evaporation on the skin in the heat of the sun.


Verse 16

מכל עץ הגן, depending on which tree’s fruit was in season. Each season required nutrients appropriate to the prevailing climate, and the fruit ripening during the various seasons would provide man with these nutrients. The prophet Ezekiel 74,12 expresses this thought in the words לחדשיו יבכר “in its appropriate month it will yield new fruit.”

Verse 17

ומעץ הדעת, the tree in the middle of the garden, in close proximity to the tree of life mentioned previously (verse 9) The meaning of חיים in connection with that tree is equivalent to the meaning of the words in Deuteronomy 30,19 החיים והמות נתתי לפניך, “I have placed life and death (to choose) before you.” [we may understand this to mean that the tree of life, if its fruit were eaten, would result in life of infinite duration, whereas eating from the tree next to it would result in life being shortened. Ed.]

Verse 18

לא טוב היות האדם לבדו, the purpose of the human species on earth will not be achieved while man who is supposed to reflect the divine image will be left to personally carry out all the menial tasks of daily life on earth by being solitary.
עזר כנגדו, a helpmate who will be equal to him, also reflecting the divine image. This is essential for him if he is to know what precisely his needs are and so that he can meet them in time. The reason why the Torah added the word כנגדו is that whenever one confronts someone of equal power, moral and ethical weight, such a confrontation is termed נגד. It is a head-on collision of will. When the two parties disagreeing are not of equal power, or moral/ethical weight, the confrontation is termed as one being עולה or יורד one of the adversaries either prevailing or losing in such an encounter. It is in this sense that we have to understand such statements as משה שקול כנגד כל ישראל, “that Moses was the equal of the entire Jewish people.” (Mechilta Yitro 1)  However, the Torah did not mean for woman to be 100% equal to man, else how could the man expect her to perform household chores for him, etc.? Hence the letter כ at the beginning of the word כנגדו somewhat tones down this equality.


Verse 19

ויצר ה' אלוקים מן האדמה כל חית השדה, G’d now provided these creatures with their final shape, putting the “finishing touches” on them, so to speak. At that stage of the earth’s condition, the original product which the earth had produced, not based on seed which contains all the genetic material in microscopic form, was not adequate to produce the final product without input by G’d, personally.
ויבא אל האדם, in order for man to realise there was a need for an additional phenomenon, seeing that amongst the existing ones none met his need for a partner.
לראות מה יקרא לו, so that he would see which name would be appropriate for each creature, based on the specific tasks they performed in the universe.
נפש חיה הוא שמו, its name would provide all of us with a clue as to its function in G’d’s scheme of things. The essence of each animal, נפש, would be revealed by its activity on earth.


Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22

ויבן ה' אלוקים את הצלע לאשה, it was someone possessing the features of a human being, much like those of a man. She would be different from man only in some external physical features. She would possess the same ability to perfect her personality as did man.

Verse 23

זאת, this female הפעם הזאת, finally, this timeעצם מעצמי ובשר מבשרי, only this time, seeing that all females of the future will not be fashioned by the male undergoing such type of surgery.
לזאת יקרא אשה, all other female human beings in the future will be known as אשה, 
even though they will not, like this time, be literally part of the flesh of their husbands.
כי מאיש לוקחה זאת, “this one,” the first woman ever.

Verse 24

על כן, seeing that on this first occasion G’d had aimed to make Adam’s wife as much part of him as possible, so that he even used Adam’s personal body as Chavah’s basic skeleton, יעזוב איש את אביו ואת אמו ודבק באשתו, it is appropriate that a man leave the home of his parents in order to acquire a wife who is compatible with him, and who is a suitable mate for him to live with on a permanent basis. The Torah teaches here also that the expression דיבוק, “cleaving,” being in a state of true union, is not possible between two people who are not alike in their common purpose in life. Parents and children do not have the same tasks and challenges. Man and his wife do have to master the same challenges, hence the word “union” can be applied to their union, whereas the same word would be inappropriate for describing the relationship between father and son, or mother and son. By living together they will become of one mind on how to deal with their lives’ challenges.
 והיו לבשר אחד, they are to work together in such close union as if there were in fact only one of them. (This had been the idea behind creating man as both male and female in the first place.)


Verse 25

ערומים ולא יתבוששו, because while in that state of innocence all their activities were aimed at pleasing their Creator. When this is the case, one has no reason to feel ashamed of anything. Just as eating and drinking was an activity they engaged in, in order to remain healthy and be able to carry out the tasks assigned to them by G’d, so marital intercourse was an activity designed exclusively to fulfill the commandments to produce more members of their species. Instead of using hands and feet to carry out other aspects of G’d’s will, in this instance they had to use their genitals for this purpose.

Chapter 3



Verse 1

והנחש, another word for Satan, which itself is a way of describing the evil urge. (Baba Batra 16). The reason why this evil urge is compared to a serpent is that just like a serpent which makes itself as invisible as possible, blending in with its environment, and yet causes more damage than the most prominently visible obstacles, so the evil urge lurks where one does not suspect to find it. It is a common practice to name phenomena according to other well known phenomena, such as calling the king “lion,” to show what is expected of a king, i.e. strength, fearlessness, etc. (compare Jeremiah 4,7 “the lion has come up from his thicket,” a reference to King Nevuchadnezzar) Also in Jeremiah 8,17 Israel’s enemies are referred to as נחשים צפעונים אשר אין להם לחש, “adders which cannot be charmed.” G’d, using a metaphor, calls the evil urge נחש, in our verse. Anything or anybody who leads Israel into sin is termed נחש. The reason why a serpent has been chosen for such a metaphor is that it is a creature whose potential harm is huge, whereas its potential benefit to man is minimal. Moreover, seeing that its visibility is minimal, it is similar to the evil urge who never attacks frontally, and often poses as friend rather than as enemy. Our sages in Pirkey de Rabbi Eliezer chapter 13 already enlarged on this metaphor by describing Samael as riding the serpent, meaning “taking advantage of this power of imagination.” The insidious nature of the evil urge consists of the fact that it conjures up in our imagination something desirable, which because of its desirability we rationalize into considering as harmless, harbouring no physical or spiritual danger for us. Greed, lust, combined with one’s imagination is a powerful tool for leading man into sin. Unless man is able to harness the power of reason against such insidious attempts to trick him into disobedience against G’d by giving in to his desire for gratification of his senses, he will fall victim to the evil urge’s machinations. When our sages (Jerusalem Talmud Berachot 1.8) said עינא ולבא סרסורי דחטאה, “the eyes and the heart are agents of sin,” they referred to the warning against the evil urge we recite twice daily in the last section of the keriyat shema. (Numbers 15,39).
היה ערום מכל חית השדה, for the power of imagination which dangles before our mental eye all sorts of visions designed to stir our desire is more powerful within man than within any other creature This is what the sages meant when they said: (Sukkah 52) “anyone who is of greater stature than his fellow also has to contend with a more powerful evil urge than his fellow.” ויאמר אל האשה, her relatively weak intellect was too lazy to understand that the images dangled before her eyes were a fatah morgana, illusion. אף כי אמר אלוקים, even though G’d has said not to eat from the tree of knowledge פן תמותון, in order that you do not die, this is not true, you will not die. Once the “serpent,” i.e. her power of imagination had sown the seed of doubt in her mind, so that her intelligence had already been undermined, she said: 

Verse 2

עץ הגן נאכלת, “we can eat from the trees of the garden and do not need to endanger our lives by eating from the tree that G’d has prohibited us to eat from on pain of death.” Having said this, however, her power of imagination kept nagging at her weighing the possibility that G’d might indeed be jealous of competition from his creature. Her doubt, i.e. the voice of the evil urge, was expressed in the words 

Verse 3



Verse 4

 לא מות תמותון “you will sure not die,

Verse 5

כי יודע אלוקים כי בים אכלכם ממנו ונפקחו עיניכם, G’d did not forbid this fruit because it is lethal, but because He knows that through eating it you will attain additional knowledge so that you will be just like G’d, possessing total knowledge.

Verse 6

ותרא האשה כי טוב העץ למאכל, she realized that the tree was good to eat due to its location, its nature and the pleasant fragrance of its fruit.
ונחמד העץ להשכיל, seeing that G’d Himself had already described the tree as being the tree of knowledge.
גם לאישה עמה, his heart was open to her words because he was her husband, and because he was by her side.


Verse 7

ותפקחנה עיני שניהם, they compared mentally, the advantages they had gained through the pleasant sensation of eating from the fruit of the tree, and the harm they had caused themselves thereby. The expression פקח implies weighing something carefully with both heart and mind. We find an example of this expression in such a sense in Job 14,3 אף על זה פקחת עינים, “Do you fix your gaze even on such a one?” [Job referring to the transient nature of man and if he is worth G’d’s attention. Ed.]
וידעו כי ערומים הם, they realized that they needed to cover their genitals which in future would serve mainly as organs designed to gratify their physical urges.


Verse 8

מתהלך בגן, back and forth, in accordance with the requirements of their purpose. The word is similar in meaning to Genesis 13,17 where Avraham is instructed by G’d התהלך to “crisscross the land of Canaan, in order to symbolically lay claim to it.” The same construction is also found in Psalms 105,13 ויתהלכו מגוי אל גוי, “they wandered from nation to nation.”
לרוח היום, according to His pleasure on that day. The word רוח is used in the abstract, spiritual sense, not referring to a breeze. This is no different that what G’d had also done during the other days of creation, and as He had been doing on this same day (sixth day of creation) prior to Adam’s sin.
ויתחבא, as the Torah wrote in Deuteronomy 23,15 ולא יראה בך ערות דבר, “no exposure of genitals (or other shameful matters) shall be visible on you.”


Verse 9

איכה, “why are you not in evidence in the garden as previously?” Why did you suddenly see the need to hide?

Verse 10

ואירא, this feeling of fear is similar to that experienced by the Jewish people in Exodus 34,30 when, because of the sin of the golden calf, the people were afraid to face him after his face radiated light when he returned from Mount Sinai. 

Verse 11

מי הגיד לך, who revealed to you the difference between good and evil?
כי עירום אתה, that on account of familiarity with evil you felt the need to cover your genitals.


Verse 12

היא, she, who was meant to be an assistant to me has turned out to be the opposite.
נתנה לי מן העץ, and has become a hindrance instead of a help. By saying these words, Adam tried to blame his Creator for having committed a sin. Adam, instead of being defensive by repenting, apologizing, admitting his guilt, as did David when the prophet Natan had called him to order over his conduct with Bat Sheva, (Samuel II 12,13) 


Verse 13

?מה זאת עשית, G’d used this introduction in order to encourage also the woman to repent her sin. G’d, after all does not want sinners to die but to rehabilitate themselves. We know this from Ezekiel 18,23 and 18,32 לא יחפוץ במות המת כי אם בשובו.

Verse 14

ארור אתה מכל. The serpent was condemned henceforth to attain its needs as well as its desires only through experiencing more pain and greater lack of pleasure than all the other creatures. Compare Kidushin 82 ראית חיה ועוף שהם בני אומנות והם מתפרנסים שלא בצער, “Did you ever see a beast or bird practicing a vocation, and yet they find their livelihood without pain?” [the scholar makes the point that our parnassah lies in the hands of G’d and is not due to our professional level. Ed.] G’d’s curse is explained in detail by the words על גחונך תלך, “you will have to crawl on your belly.” This means that the serpent will find its sustenance only laboriously, experiencing frustration in doing so. Our sages (Berachot 58) mention how many laborious stages the kernel of wheat had to undergo until Adam finally was able to eat the bread that he made out of it.
ועפר תאכל, you will not enjoy the food (or other earthly  pleasures) previously enjoyable. The Talmud Sotah 49 describes something similar happening to the Jewish people  as a whole after the destruction of the Temple, saying: הטהרה נטלה את הטעם ואת הריח, והמעשרות נטלו את שומן הדגן, [the subject being the negative fallout for the entire nation of the destruction of the Temple, Ed.] “previously pleasant tasting and fragrant foods no longer tasted as well with the exception of food which needed to be consumed in a state of ritual purity, and the tithes now assumed the  richness of cereals.”

Verse 15

ואיבה אשית, woman would henceforth be an object of disgust even in her own estimation, as described in the Talmud (Shabbat 152) “although a woman is a vessel full of excrement and her orifice full of blood,” (men run after her as if she was the most desirable creature) This was going to be the relationship between males and females in the future, not only that between Adam and Chavah [who apparently could not bring himself to have intercourse with her for the next 130 years. Ed.]
ובין זרעך ובין זרעה, not only between Adam and Chavah, but also between their respective male and female offspring.
הוא ישופך ראש, these thoughts crossing man’s mind will reduce the satisfaction he obtains already in the early stages of sexual intercourse, a feeling gradually reinforced when he considers the potential harm he may cause himself by indulging in copulation, diminishing both the qualitative and quantitative enjoyment  of it.
ואתה תשופנו עקב, he who initially derives pleasure from his superiority will eventually cause himself harm at the end of the pleasure cycle.


Verse 16

הרבה ארבה עצבונך, the menstrual blood, known in the Torah and Talmud as נדת דותה (Niddah 9 and Leviticus 12,2) The prophet Jeremiah in Lamentations 1,13 describes the state of the Jewish people after the destruction of the Temple as כל היום דוה, as if she lost menstrual blood all day long. 
והרונך, her pregnancy will be exactly the opposite of what it had been before she sinned. Our sages (Bereshit Rabbah 22,22) describe that at that time Adam and Chavah were created, copulated, and produced offspring, all on the same day. This is also what things will be like in the future according to Shabbat 30 “in the future woman will be able to give birth every day.” Such a situation will occur when the Jewish people once more regain G’d’s favour, as had been the case prior to the original sin.
בעצב תלדי בנים, you will experience anguish while engaged in raising them, by comparison to the other creatures on earth who do not experience such prolonged periods during which they have to look after all the needs of their young. The word לידה does appear in the context of raising children (not even one’s own) such as in the case of Michal, daughter of King Sha-ul, wife of David of whom we are told (Samuel II 21,8) חמשת בני מיכל בת שאול אשר ילדה לעדריאל בן ברזילי המחולתי“the five sons of Michal, daughter of Sha-ul whom she had born to Adriel son of Barzilai the Mecholti.” [Michal had not given birth to these five sons, but her older sister Merav, who had died very young so that Michal, her sister, had raised her nephews. Ed.]


Verse 17

כי שמעת לקול אשתך, by attributing to G’d such negative characteristics as lying and jealousy.
ותאכל מן העץ, thereby rebelling and causing yourself death as you had been warned about. Because you listened and accepted the argument to think of G’d as imperfect, ארורה האדמה, the earth will not continue to put its potential at your disposal without your having to exert yourself by hard labour. Furthermore, also because you rebelled and violated My command,

Verse 18



Verse 19

אל עפר תשוב, you will revert to dust, just as I had told you “on the day you eat from it you will surely become mortal.” (not that he would actually die on that same day).

Verse 20

חוה, she is a necessary requirement for the human species to continue life on earth.
כי היא היתה אם כל חי,  even though the function of the female of the species listed here also applies to all women after Chavah, she is used as the role model and therefore accorded this name. The reason is that she was the first woman ever to fulfill this role.


Verse 21

ויעש ...כתנות עור, without any input by man, similar to a description of the Talmud of what the earth will produce without human input in idyllic times when ready made bread rolls will be produced by the earth (Shabbat 30)
וילבישם, in order that He would not have to expel them from Gan Eden while they were naked. Not only that, but if they would dress themselves in these coats after having been expelled, they might delude themselves that they had improved on G’d’s handiwork.


Verse 22

כאחד ממנו לדעת טוב ורע, he will know good and evil even while continuing to wear “our image.” This would be an intolerable situation, as in spite of his tendency to give in to his evil urge he would live on forever. [the author considers בצלמנו as a reference to the infinite life prevailing among the celestial beings. Ed.] In such circumstances, this Adam whose evil urge was active would continue to chase the material blessings of this world, something which would prevent him from reaching the spiritual aims set for him on earth when G’d made him in the divine image.

Verse 23

וישלחהו, He expelled him. G’d ordered Adam to leave the garden. The expression is used in the same vein as Exodus 12,33 למהר לשלחם מן הארץ, “hastening to send them out of the country.” (Pharaoh)
האדמה אשר לוקח משם, the place to which Adam was transferred was compatible with the requirements of his constitution, more so than other areas on the globe.


Verse 24

ויגרש את האדם, in order to ensure that neither he nor his offspring would return to Gan Eden.
וישכן, G’d placed the cherubs there simultaneously with Adam’s departure. לשמור את דרך עץ החיים, to ensure that on the way out they would not take from its fruit and eat thereof.


Chapter 4



Verse 1



Verse 2

ויהי הבל רועה צאן, Hevel chose this vocation as it required more intelligence and involved one’s mental activities more that farming.
וקין היה עובד אדמה, as a result of each having his own vocation, they each brought different offerings to G’d.

Verse 3



Verse 4

אל הבל ואל מנחתו, seeing that Hevel was pleasing in the eyes of G’d, his gift was also pleasing, seeing that it consisted of the type of product welcome to G’d as an offering.

Verse 5

ואל קין ואל מנחתו לא שעה, He did not turn to Kayin the donor, as he was not pleasing in the eyes of G’d; He also did not turn with favour to his offering seeing the nature of the offering was not designed to make it welcome;
ויחר, due to his jealousy of his brother,
ויפלו פניו, he was downcast, being ashamed, feeling that G’d had publicly shamed him.


Verse 6

למה חרה לך, “why are you jealous of your brother? I did not arbitrarily accept his offering, nor did I do so without justification.
ולמה נפלו פניך, as long as there is a chance to correct what had gone wrong there is no reason to be sad over what is past; one has to try and make amends by doing better in the future.


Verse 7

הלא אם תיטיב, if only you improve yourself you will also be welcome in My eyes.
שאת, every lofty level of greatness is lying in wait for you, ready to become yours,
ואם לא תיטיב לפתח חטאת רובץ, however, sin is also lying in wait for you if you will add further intentional sin to the already performed unintentional sin. This is the way of the evil urge, that once you give into it, it will forever be ready to tempt you again.
כי אליך תשוקתו, “for it longs for you due to its very nature. It too is anxious to satisfy its desires, its aspirations every day.”
ואתה תמשול בו, it is within your power to overcome the power of the evil urge thanks to the צלם אלוקים, the divine image with which you have been provided at birth. This conforms to our sages in Sukkah 52 who have taught that were it not for this צלם אלוקים, which represents G’d’s assistance against the evil urge, there would be no way man could cope with temptation. This is what David meant in Psalms 37,33 ה' לא יעזבנו בידו ולא ירשיענו בהשפטו, “the Lord will not abandon him to his power; He will not let him be condemned in judgment.”


Verse 8

ויאמר קין אל הבל אחיו, how upset he was, and how he had become downcast on account of his brother.
ויהי בהיותם בשדה, away from the presence of their parents.
ויקם קין, Kayin arose without any previous quarrel, similar to Deuteronomy 19,11 וארב לו וקם עליו, “he ambushed him and attacked him.”


Verse 9

אי הבל אחיך, “in which place did you bury him?” G’d phrased this as a question only in order to give Kayin a chance to begin the process of repentance, not because He was not perfectly aware where Kayin had buried Hevel. G’d did not want to be forced to kill someone already guilty of the death penalty.
לא ידעתי, “I do not know.” He thought that the question concerned Hevel’s whereabouts. Seeing that Kayin had not been interested previously in G’d’s ability to know the future, or to become close to Him; such knowledge about G’d was reserved to those who are cleaving to Him.


Verse 10



Verse 11

ארור אתה מן האדמה, cursed and deprived of the good the earth has to offer.
אשר פצתה את פיה, because it allowed itself to be used to  cover up the killing of your brother. As a result, earth will no longer be free to provide the needs of your livelihood in the degree it did up until now. There was no need to spell out the penalty for the murderer. His punishment is part of the principle applying to the penalty for anyone causing willful damage, i.e. he will experience tit for tat as spelled out in Leviticus 24,19.


Verse 12



Verse 13

גדול עוני מנשוא, after Kayin finally realised how G’d in Heaven supervises every detail which goes on down on earth, he was convinced that G’d must know that his sole motivation in doing repentance was to escape punishment. Even this type of repentance was wrung from him only after G’d had pressured him to display penitence. He was embittered, and this is what prompted him to exclaim that the severity of his sin was such there was no hope to obtain forgiveness which would protect him against retribution in kind. The matter is similar to Saul’s failure in killing Agag, King of Amalek. Saul had said to Samuel: “I have sinned,” only after Samuel had insisted that he make a confession of having failed to carry out G’d’s instructions. (Samuel I 15,24) Samuel had had to tell Saul that G’d had despised him as a future leader of the Jewish people before he could prevail on Saul to acknowledge his wrongdoing. (Samuel I 15,24)


Verse 14

והיה כל מוצאי יהרגני, the fact that anyone who finds me is legally entitled to kill me makes my punishment much more severe than You, G’d, have told me.

Verse 15

כל הורג קין שבעתים יוקם, I, G’d, announce that anyone who dares to kill Kayin, [i.e. who takes the law into his own hands, Ed.] would be punished seven more times than what the crime he committed appears to warrant. Anyone who is prepared to kill someone is called הורג, as for instance, in Hoseah 9,13 ואפרים להוציא אל הורג בניו, “Ephrayim too must bring out his children to his slayers.” The word שבעתים means “twice seven times,” as in Proverbs 6,31 ונמצא ישלם שבעתים, “when he is found out he must pay twice sevenfold.” G’d decreed therefore that when someone killed half the human race, or at least a third of the human race, the appropriate vengeance would involve a twice sevenfold penalty. This would manifest itself in such a slayer being a restless wanderer on earth for seven generations. Such a life is considered worse than death. When David prays in Psalms 59,12אל תהרגם פן ישכחו עמי הניעמו בחילך, “do not kill them lest my people will forget them; make them wanderers seeing it is in Your power,” he meant that they be killed only at the end of seven generations. David wanted the punishment of his enemies to last. If they would all die and disappear at once their absence would soon be forgotten. Kayin got his deserts at the end of seven generations as we know from traditional sources in Tanchuma 10.

הרגתי לפצעי, I have caused myself real injury, for the one who has killed my father (ancestor Kayin) has inflicted upon me the child a deep wound, seeing that the killer was my son.


Verse 24

ולמך שבעים ושבעה. My anguish over what I have done will be many times greater than the anguish of Kayin who had been condemned to be a constant fugitive on the earth. 'כי שבעתים יוקם קין וגו, for if Kayin’s punishment was indeed great, my punishment for having killed my son will be many times greater. [he referred to the anguish he suffered over what he had done, not to the punishment imposed upon him externally, as retribution. Ed.]

Verse 25



Verse 26

'אז הוחל לקרא בשם ה, at that time the righteous people of the earth began to preach monotheism to the public. The meaning is similar to Genesis 21,33 ויקרא שם בשם ה' א-ל עולם, “Avraham proclaimed there the name of the Lord, the Lord of the universe.” The time had come to publicly confront and refute the arguments of the idolaters in that period.

Chapter 5



Verse 1

זה ספר תולדות אדם, thus begins the story of human history, and events worth recording for all posterity.
 בדמות אלוקים עשה אותו, a reference to man’s free will. It is in this respect that man is like G’d. This is why when different generations of man angered G’d they were punished, [i.e. they had not been programmed to do evil. Ed.] 

Verse 2

Chapter 6



Verse 1



Verse 2



Verse 3

לא ידון רוחי בארם לעולם בשגם הוא בשר, it is intolerable that there will continue the argument, strife before Me allowing (the angels?) to claim that although seeing that man has been endowed with divine qualities he must be punished, whereas his close ties to physical earth must be considered as excuses for his conduct, entitling him to continued mercy, and indulgence by Me.
והיו ימיו, he will be given a certain length of time within which to repent his sins;
מאה ועשרים שנה, during which time Noach would have time to construct the ark, and by doing so rebuking and warning people of what is in store for them. (compare Sanhedrin 108)


Verse 4

הנפילים היו בארץ בימים ההם, these giants were not about until the last 120 years which G’d had assigned man as a grace period within which to do teshuvah וגם אחר כן, as well as thereafter, i.e. they did not repent and mend their ways at all.


Verse 5

כי רבה רעת האדם,  a reference to the past,
וכל יצר לב האדם, a reference to the future (when it would not improve)


Verse 6

ויתעצב אל לבו, seeing that G’d does not want even the guilty to die instead of finding their way back. The opposite “emotion” of G’d to the one expressed here is found in Psalms 104,31 ישמח ה' במעשיו, “the Lord ‘enjoys’ the deeds of His creatures.”

Verse 7



Verse 8

ונח מצא חן, this is an explanation why also his sons and daughters (in law) were saved. Noach’s personal merits did not entitle him to demand from G’d that He also save them on the strength of his merits. They required special חנינה, clemency  (based on Bereshit Rabbah 29,1. According to the verse in Ezekiel 14,14-19 G’d discusses with the prophet the three men Noach, Daniel, and Job as possessing sufficient merit to be saved themselves, but as not having sufficient merit to entitle their families to be saved [the rider there is if these three men had lived in the (wicked) city described by G’d to Ezekiel, the men of the city would not have been saved by their presence.] The reason why these individuals were not as effective in saving the people around them was that they were devout and pious for themselves without trying to use their influence to convert their contemporaries to adopt their lifestyles. This is what made them basically different from Avraham, Moses and Samuel and others like them, who went out to win converts. This is what the sages in Pessachim 87 had in mind when they described such people. The Talmud distinguishes between people who זכו ללמוד ולא זכו ללמד, “acquired the merit of studying Torah, but did not acquire the merit of disseminating Torah knowledge.” [Rashi in the Talmud contrasts Daniel’s activities in Eylam (the country of which Shushan was the capital) with those of Ezra in Babylon. The former, while learning Torah, did not teach it, the latter both learned and taught with very beneficial results. Ed.] A righteous person who keeps perfecting himself is entitled to being saved personally, but he is not entitled thereby to save others on his account. While Noach did rebuke the men of his time, he did not travel the extra mile to try and convert them to do good. Our sages in Berachot 19 comment that “if you see a Torah scholar who was guilty of something improper during the day, do not accuse him of anything in your mind during the following night for surely he has done teshuvah in the interval.”


Verse 9

תולדות נח, a reference to his history, commencing with his own life and continuing with that of his offspring.
צדיק, in his deeds,
תמים, in his attitudes, בדורותיו, according to the generations during which he lived. They included part of the generation of Metushelach, of Lemech, and those during the 600 years preceding the deluge.
את האלוקים התהלך נח, he walked in G’d’s way trying to be helpful to others, and to instruct and if necessary to rebuke them, as our sages pointed out. This is also in accordance with what the historian Berussi Hacaldaii (3rd century B.C.) wrote about him.


Verse 10

ויולד נח, as soon as he began to rebuke his fellowmen he was granted children

Verse 11



Verse 12

והנה נשחתה, without external influences, as a natural consequence, not due to man’s ecologically criminal behaviour. Although on the surface, there appeared to be no connection, man’s corruption resulted in the corruption of his habitat. The language used here by the Torah is comparable to Isaiah 47,2 וטחני קמח, “and grind meal.”  One does not grind flour, but one grinds grain into flour. The prophet spoke about the end product. The Torah also spoke about the end product of man’s corruption bringing in its wake, though invisibly, the destruction of the earth’s crust.

Verse 13

ויאמר..קץ כל בשר, a reference to the end of the period G’d had allocated to man for his repentance. 
בא לפני, this period has now expired.
כי מלאה הארץ חמס מפניהם, for they all rob each other. The owners rob their leaseholders, the leaseholders rob the owners through deceit, so that in the final analysis all of the earth’s produce is grown for the benefit of robbers.
והנני משחיתם את הארץ, so that now I will destroy them together with the earth. I will destroy the climate which could support life on earth by interfering with the sun’s orbit and rearranging it from the beginning of the deluge for the entire future. We find that G’d explained this to Job In Job 38, 4-15. This accounts for the lifespan of man having been drastically reduced after the deluge. The climate of the earth changed, there were greater extremes of heat and cold, the produce of the earth was considerably less capable of supporting a long lifespan. As a by-product of this deterioration in the quality of the vegetable products, man was allowed to eat meat as a compensation.


Verse 14

'עשה לך תבת וגו, during the period allocated to them, in order to remind them to do teshuvah.

Verse 15



Verse 16

בצדה תשים, on the side which is wide, for that is the side called צד. The long side is referred to as צלע.
תחתיים, the lower deck in ships; as in any other ship, the customary lower deck.
שניים ושלשים, they are similar, parallel to the lower deck.


Verse 17

ואני הנני מביא את המבול, G’d is saying, that Noach’s task is to build the ark, whereas He, when the time expires, will bring on the deluge He had threatened as soon as the ark would be completed. The word מבול is a variant of מפלה, referring to something lost as in Deut. 14,21 כל נבלה, a carcass being a life lost. The definitive article ה in המבול refers to the destruction, the nature of which had not previously been spelled out. [my paraphrasing. Ed.]

Verse 18

והקימותי את בריתי, a reference to the covenant G’d made with Noach after the deluge.

This is why the Torah added the words מאדם ועד בהמה, עד רמש ועד עוף השמים וימחו מן הארץ, “man or beast, moving creatures, including the birds of the sky disintegrated completely.” No traceable remains survived.

Verse 24

ויגברו...חמישים ומאת יום. These 150 days are counted from the beginning of the 40 days of rainfall. The level of water on the surface of the earth kept increasing for 150 days, concluding on the 17th of the seventh month (Nissan). On that date the ark came to rest (on the waters) seeing there was no pressure exerted on it from any direction. The pressure on the ark to move was exerted from the first day of the rain when the Torah simultaneously reported the fountains below opening and adding their water to that of the rain. (verse 11). The ark resisted this pressure until the waters on earth were so high that they lifted the ark from its base. When the days of rainfall had concluded, the pressure from the subterranean waters kept up until the end of 150 days. When that pressure ceased the ark finally came to rest on Mount Ararat.

כי יצר לב האדם רע , seeing that after the deluge the climatic conditions on the earth became considerably less favourable, people did not develop as much intellectually and at such an early age as prior to the deluge. Before the deluge, the evil urge, and the urge to act wisely and not self-destructively, had been in balance, now the evil urge was active already in their earliest youth and was not balanced by the presence of an active יצר טוב. [This helps us understand why G’d appeared to be more indulgent of human weakness after the deluge instead of the reverse. Ed.]


Verse 22

עוד כל ימי הארץ זרע וקציר, וקור וחום, וקיץ וחורף, ויום ולילה, לא ישבתו; nature will not cease to function dependably as it had prior to the deluge. The sun will orbit predictably, its orbit will be subject to calculation in advance, so will be its position relative to other phenomena in the sky. All the time periods mentioned in this verse will somehow be related to the position of the sun at different times during the year. It would be different from before the deluge. Whereas prior to the deluge the sun had remained at a fixed distance relative to the earth all year round, its orbit being circular, resulting in eternal spring in the populated parts of the earth, now there would be all these changes, though at predetermined intervals, resulting in alternating seasons of relative warmth and cold due to the elliptical nature of the sun’s orbit [Although the author lived approximately at the time of Copernicus having determined that the earth moves around the sun instead of being the center of our galaxy, the basic concept even according to the ancient world view does not invalidate the author’s description of antediluvian and postdiluvian climatic conditions. Ed.. כל ימי הארץ, until such time as G’d would correct this deterioration in living conditions on earth due to the effect of the deluge. This “correction” is what the prophet Isaiah 66,22 had in mind when he spoke of the הארץ החדשה אשר אני עושה, “the new earth which I am going to make.” In that future foreseen by the prophet, the sun will once more orbit like a circle instead of like an ellipsis, a configuration responsible for the uneven temperatures on earth during different parts of the year. At that time, the whole vegetation on earth will undergo an upgrading, the curse earth experienced both after Adam’s sin and after Kayin’s murder of his brother Hevel being lifted. Conditions of length of human life will revert to what they had been before the deluge, as the prophet said that a נער, a youth, if he dies at a hundred years old will be considered as having died in his adolescence and more verses there describing this future. This is also what David referred to in Psalms 65,9 מוצאי בוקר וערב תרנין, “You make the lands of sunrise and sunset shout for joy.”

Verse 3



Verse 4

אך בשר בנפשו, but the flesh of living animals, while its life-force is still inside it,
 i.e. this life-force is equivalent to its blood; you must neither eat its flesh nor its blood,
לא תאכלו, only in that state must you not eat it; once the blood has left the body, gentiles are allowed to eat blood.


Verse 5

ואך את דמכם לנפשותיכם אדרוש, although I will not punish you for spilling animal’s blood, I will hold you responsible for shedding the blood of fellow human beings. Human beings, all human beings, are more precious to Me than the lives of animals. This retribution for spilling the blood of human beings may on different occasions be applied in different ways: It all depends on the worthiness of the person under attack or potential attack. If, for instance, the person deserves saving, the words מיד כל חיה אדרשנו ומיד אדם are meant in the preventive sense, i.e. G’d will save such a person’s life be it under attack from animals or from human beings. If, in the eyes of G’d, the person under attack does not deserve being saved from violent death, this still did not give the animals or other human beings the right to kill him. Therefore, in such instances, ipso facto, G’d will exact retribution from the killers. 
This is the meaning of the apparently redundant words מיד איש אחיו אדרוש את נפש האדם, where the word אדרוש refers to the life of a human being that has already been killed. We find the word אדרוש in both senses depending on circumstances, compare Ezekiel 34,10. The emphasis on איש את אחיו, refers to G’d exacting such retribution from humans for killing humans, seeing that this is not their nature, or should not be their nature. He will not exact retribution from an animal which killed a human being who, in G’d’s eyes, had already forfeited its right to live.

Verse 6

באדם דמו ישפך, a reference to a human tribunal.
כי בצלם אלוקים, this is the reason why G’d exacts retribution for killing human beings, whereas He does not exact retribution from man for killing animals, [even though killing, say for sport is prohibited. Ed.] The animals have not been created in the image of G’d, so that their death does not deprive the earth of a divine image. Only human beings are described in the Torah, on occasion, also as אלוהים, as for instance in Exodus 22,8. <br> את האדם, from the moment G’d had said (Genesis 1,26) נעשה אדם, “let us make a human being,” He had endowed His creatures with an independent intelligence, able to defy Him either collectively or individually. It is this “divine attribute” of man that makes him sufficiently important for his Creator to demand an accounting from those who destroy that divine image by killing a human being.


Verse 7

ואתם פרו ורבו, not only must you not diminish the human population on earth, but you are commanded to increase it by being fruitful and by multiplying.

Verse 8



Verse 9

ואני הנני מקים את בריתי, this promise is conditional on man keeping his part of the bargain, bringing murderers to justice. If, however, innocent blood will be shed in the manner it had been before the deluge, this may lead to destruction of the earth (not necessarily by water). This is what is meant in Numbers 35,33 הדם הוא יחניף את הארץ ולארץ לא יכופר לדם אשר שפך בה כי אם בדם שפכו  “for blood turns the earth into a hypocrite and there will be no atonement for the land except through the blood of him who has spilled it.” 

Verse 10



Verse 11

ולא יהיה עוד מבול לשחת הארץ, there will not ever again be the kind of catastrophe which will destroy the whole surface of the earth at the same time.

Verse 12



Verse 13

את קשתי נתתי בענן, I have arranged that the rainbow become a natural phenomenon.
והיתה לאות ברית, there is a dual function to the rainbow; it is true that the scientists have already tired of trying to explain the phenomenon of the various colours of the second rainbow, something which appears in the opposite order of the colours in the original rainbow, [according to the encyclopedia Britannica, there are primary and secondary rainbows, the secondary rainbow having a colour pattern in a reverse order of that known as the primary rainbow. Our author may understand that which has baffled scientists in his time, as a hint of the dual nature of the rainbow, i.e. as a warning, or a promise respectively. Ed.] According to the view of the sages in Ketuvot 77 the very appearance of the rainbow is a reminder that the generation in which it appears is a guilty generation. It is reported there that two generations were fortunate enough that in their time no rainbow was ever observed. This was interpreted as a sign that the people of that generation did not need the phenomenon of the rainbow to alert them to become penitents. Their religious leaders did an outstanding job in prevailing on the people to be Torah-observant. [according to the של'ה, it is not reasonable to assume that there were periods when the laws of nature were suspended and there was no rainbow; rather if the Jewish people during certain periods were very deserving, had lots of merits, so that they did not need to be reminded of the deluge, the rain descended at night when no rainbow would become visible even if they had not been a deserving generation. Ed.]


Verse 14

בענני ענן, a reminder that the rainbow will not be visible unless there are dark clouds in the sky after the atmosphere had been very moist.

Verse 15



Verse 16

וראיתיה לזכור ברית עולם, I will take a close look at how the righteous of that time call the ordinary people to order, and whether their prayers are on behalf of their contemporaries. If they make their weight felt, I, in turn, will remember My covenant in their favour, and My wrath at them will be turned aside.

Verse 17

ויאמר אלוקים לנח זאת אות הברית, the word זאת refers to the “secondary” rainbow, [I mentioned earlier. Ed.] which acts as the sign of the warning aspect of the covenant. When this rainbow appears it is high time to call people to order and to warn them of impending natural calamities unless they change their ways.

Verse 18

וחם הוא אבי כנען, he was similar in his conduct to his son Canaan, who was famous as being evil. Such descriptions implying “like father like son,” are also found, for instance in Ezekiel 16,3 אביך האמורי, “your father the Emorite,” (meaning that the prophet chides Israel for its actions saying these could make one think that Israel’s ancestor had been the Emorite,” (one of the Canaanite tribes).

Verse 19

שלשה אלה בני נח, seeing that all of them were Noach’s sons, G’d blessed them all, even though one of them was wicked, when He said “be fruitful and multiply and fill the globe.” As a result of this blessing, באלה נפצה כל הארץ, the entire population of the earth traces its origin to one of these three sons of Noach.


Verse 20

ויחל נח, he profaned himself, began to engage in unseemly activities. As a consequence, some of the results were negative. Our story illustrates how a seemingly minor deviation from accepted norms will ultimately result in major deviations from acceptable conduct. A case in point is found in Numbers 25,1 where the Israelites began by indulging in sexual permissiveness with the daughters of Moav, only to end up in worshipping their deities, and 24,000 Israelites being killed by a plague sent by G’d. Interestingly, that chapter also began with the word ויחל, (profaning oneself).

Verse 21



Verse 22

וירא חם אבי כנען את ערות אביו, he saw the shameful deed his son כנען had done to his father Noach when he had castrated him. (according to some of our sages in Sanhedrin 70) According to the historian Berussi Hacaldaii, (compare Genesis 6,9) Canaan castrated his grandfather not surgically, but by some means of sorcery. His father Cham watched his son invoke the witchcraft without protesting or trying to stop him. Disgrace, shame, is also called ערוה, “nakedness.” Compare Ezra 4,14 וערות מלכא לא אריך לנא למחזא “it is not right that we should see the king being disgraced.” Also, in Deuteronomy 21,4 the expression ערות דבר does not refer to either literal nakedness, or to sexual licentiousness, or incest, but refers to “a disgraceful thing.”
ויגד לשני אחיו בחוץ, he revealed that he had enjoyed what his son had done. 


Verse 23

ופניהם אחורנית, even when only covering their father they walked with their faces averting their eyes from him. It would have caused them additional grief to behold their father in such a state.

Verse 24



Verse 25

עבד עבדים יהיה לאחיו, his being in a position of dependence to his senior brothers, i.e. a plain עבד, was merely natural, and would not have been a special curse, especially in view of his disgraceful conduct. Solomon  paraphrased this in Proverbs 11,29 when he spoke about ועבד אויל לחכם לב, that “a fool is a slave to the wise-hearted.”

Verse 26

ויהי כנען, his offspring [seeing that the word ויהי is in the future tense; Ed.] 
עבד למו, to the G’d as well as to the offspring of Shem. The formulation is parallel to Joshua 9,27 where the Gibeonites are condemned to be “hewers of wood and carriers of water” for the Israelites (having duped them into thinking that they were not Canaanites)


Verse 27

באהלי שם, (the plural mode) is a reference to Torah academies in addition to the Temple.
עבד למו, both to Yaphet and to Shem, even at times when the Temple will not stand.

Verse 6

ופוט וכנען, the sons of Put are not mentioned separately, as they all formed a single nation retaining the name of their founding father. Proof of this is found in Ezekiel 38,5 פרס, כוש, ופוט אתם, i.e. even in the days of the pre-messianic wars of Gog and Magog, Put will still have its original name.

Verse 7

ובני כוש סבא וחוילה, each one of these sons became a nation in its own right. This was in addition to those of his sons who continued to bear their founding father’s name. (compare Isaiah 43,3)

Verse 8

וכוש ילד את נמרד, among all the others who were called by their father’s name “Kushites,” there was one special individual who rose to become a world renowned hero, warrior, king.

Verse 9

'לפני ה, this does not mean that he was on the same wavelength as G’d; on the contrary, such expressions are used when someone equates himself and his illusion of power with that of G’d. Compare Jonah 3,3 עיר גדולה לאלוהים, “a great city, G’d-like.” [they were G’d-like in their arrogance. Ed.]

Verse 10

ותהי ראשית ממלכתו בבל, the Torah mentions this to explain that because of Nimrod’s powerful and relatively civilised kingdom all the people moved to the valley of Shinor to be within the orbit of his power and influence. The illusion of great power, augmented by unity of purpose, led to their insurrection against G’d, and to their downfall. Central symbols always exercised a gravitational pull on people’s minds, as we see even among the Jewish people in the efforts by Jerobam to counteract the centrality of the Temple in Jerusalem. (Kings I 12,26)

Verse 11

מן הארץ ההיא יצא אשור, he emigrated from there because he disagreed with Nimrod politically, i.e. he opposed the building of the Tower (fearing that G’d would punish the people including his children who were associating themselves with rebellious project)
ויבן את נינוה, because he had distanced himself from the plans undertaken by the four countries under the rule of Nimrod in the land of Shinor, G’d rewarded him to let him build the four cities mentioned here. This is an instance of אל פניו ישלם לו, of G’d recompensing someone for a good deed “to his face,” i.e. so that he can realise that this is what G’d has done for him. (Deuteronomy 7,10)

Verse 21

ולשם יולד, the formulation suggests that the son born to Shem resembled his father in his good qualities, the son in question being עבר. 
גם הוא אבי כל בני עבר, although, as we know from the description of Avraham as an עברי, a Hebrew, (a descendant of Ever) i.e. as someone believing in G’d the Creator being the sole G’d, and it might appear that Ever initiated this adherence to monotheism in his time, Shem, the father too, was a founder of preaching monotheism in his time. Anyone teaching and instructing others, especially in a way of life and philosophy, is called אבי, “father of.” We have come across this term as possessing such meaning already in Genesis 4,21 when Yuval was introduced as the inventor and teacher of how to play musical instruments featuring strings. Just as the teachers, mentors are called “fathers,” so the disciples are called “sons,” בנים, as in Samuel I 10,12 בני הנביאים, “the disciples of the prophets.”

Verse 23



Verse 24



Verse 25

פלג..כי בימיו נפלגה הארץ, this verse informs us of the moral stature of Ever who was able to foresee by means of holy spirit what the future held in store during the lifetime of his son. He called his son Peleg in order to allude to the fact that commencing with his son, man’s life on earth would be drastically shorter. In fact, it was due to the sin committed when his generation built the Tower, that G’d punished them by making them physically weaker so that they aged much more rapidly. The collapse of the Tower was also accompanied by a change in the earth’s climate. (may be not so much the earth’s climate, but the adjustment necessary for the bodies of the people emigrating to regions on earth which had a climate different from that in Mesopotamia)

Chapter 11



Verse 1



Verse 2

It is the custom of shepherds to move from one place to another to find good pasture.

Verse 3

"Come let us make bricks" to build houses and sheep folds.  And this was the idea of the individuals in the general public as it says "and one man said to his fellow."

Verse 4

"And they said, come let us build for ourselves a city." This was the idea of the leaders of the generation: to make Nimrod the king of all of humanity.
"And a tower that reaches the heavens, and we will make a name for ourselves."  We will make a name like a tower [i.e., solid]. The tale of the height of the place and size of the city will spread among all of humanity in a way that it will be considered by everyone to be the god of all gods, and all will seek it out.  And the intention in this was that the king of that city would reign over all of humanity in that everyone would seek it out.

Verse 5

"God came down to see."  Now, the usage of "going down to see" is used with the Blessed God when the matter is not yet appropriate for punishment, rather from the evil that will come out of it at the end of story, like the example of the wayward and rebellious son, of which they said that the Torah went to the conclusion of his ideas.  Also similar is the situation with Sodom, where it is written "I will go down and see."  Because their wickedness was not greater enough than the rest of the idol worshippers that they should be punished in this world, except in the matter of cruelty against the poor, from which total evil will come in the end, as it says "This was the sin of Sodom your sister: they did not strengthen the hand of the poor and indigent," and this too was the punishment of Israel when they were exiled as it says "I will see what their end will be."

Verse 6

הן עם אחד, the only way I can stop them from carrying out their unanimously approved plan is to sow the seeds of discord between them. The instrument of bringing this about is to confuse their language. Basically, people’s disagreements are either religious, (philosophical) in nature, or they result from misunderstanding what they mean when they speak. These people had been of one mind in matters of religion, seeing that they had all agreed with the mistaken idolatrous philosophy shared by mankind at that time. In spite of such apparently good reasons for disagreeing with one another, they did not misunderstand each other.
וזה החלו לעשות, and yet they all agree to begin this project. 
ועתה לא יבצר מהם, in view of these circumstances, if left alone, they would complete what they have set out to do, so that this form of idolatry they have agreed on would henceforth be something embraced by all of mankind. Not a single one of them would turn to the Creator of the universe and realise that He, and He alone, is the Creator of the entire universe. On the other hand, the opposite will occur if discord will break out among them regarding the supremacy of any of the deities versus the competing ones. In such a scenario, every nation would believe that there is one deity that is superior to all the various national deities, whose concern is only with the particular nation worshipping that deity. All the minor deities would have to subordinate themselves to the power of that super-deity. The prophet Maleachi 1,11 expresses this in the following words: ”for from where the sun rises to where it sets, My name is honoured among the nations;” כי ממזרח שמש ועד מבואו גדול שמי בגוים.

Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11

ויולד בנים ובנות, the Torah does not mention even once the word וימות, “he died,” something that appears with the report of each of the generations preceding the deluge. The reason why the Torah mentioned the death of those generations was because each of them died before the main subject of the entire chapter had been reached, i.e. the destruction of life on earth by the deluge. The people in the generations from Noach onward are considered as having been forerunners fo a positive development, as opposed to their predecessors who simply died before everybody else died also. In our chapter the thrust of the story is to show that eventually a towering personality such as Avraham emerged on earth, so that those who preceded him may be viewed as paving the way for Avraham’s eventual emergence on the stage of history. Avraham’s greatness is enhanced by the relatively insignificant lives of his predecessors.

Verse 31

ללכת ארצה כנען, this land is prepared for enabling its residents to acquire all intellectual advantages, and, as far as G’d is concerned, it is the most preferred of all the countries on earth. We have this on the authority of the Torah itself which says of that land (Deuteronomy 11,12) ארץ אשר ה' אלוקיך דורש אותה תמיד עיני ה' אלוקיך בה מרשית השנה ועד אחרית שנה, “and concerning which G’d enquires constantly, His eyes being trained on it from the beginning of the year until the year’s end.” The climate of the land of Canaan had not been negatively affected by the rains of the deluge, as had the climate of all other parts of the globe. We have this on the authority of Ezekiel 22,24 ארץ לא גשמה ביום זעם, “a land which did not experience rain on the day of the fury.” This may well be the reason why the sages (Baba Batra 58) said that the climate of the land of Israel makes people smarter.

Verse 32

וימת תרח בחרן, he had not made an effort to realise his intention of moving all the way to the land of Canaan as he had set out to do in verse 31. He never even visited his son Avraham in the land of Canaan, never observing with his own eyes what a great name Avraham had made for himself and G’d there. Lot, on the other hand, did the opposite for a while at least, having joined Avraham, kept him company and this is why both he and his offspring benefited from this both immediately, such as when Lot became rich in Egypt, as well as much later when Israel was not allowed to conquer the lands belonging to Lot’s descendants, i.e. Ammon and Moav. (compare Nachmanides on Pinchas 25,18)

Chapter 12



Verse 1

אל הארץ אשר אראך, to the specific area within the country which I will show you in a heavenly vision. This is why Avram kept moving further into the land without pitching his tent to settle down until he received the appropriate sign from G’d. This occurred when he reached Shechem, where we are told that G’d appeared to him (verse 7)

Verse 2

והיה ברכה, a true blessing by G’d is when G’d rejoices in our deeds and actions. Our sages (Berachot 7) illustrate this when they quote a conversation between the High Priest Rabbi Yishmael ben Elisha who, while offering incense on Yom Kippur, had a vision of the angel Katriel sitting on the throne of G’d. The latter said to him: “Yishmael, My son, bless Me.” He said to him: (in the words attributed as being G’d’s own ‘prayer’) “may it be Your will that Your mercy will subdue Your anger and may Your mercy exile Your justified attribute to punish Your people for their sins, and may Your mercy prevail so that You deal with Your children by applying the attribute of Mercy.” When G’d’s representative, the angel Katriel heard this, he touched the High Priest on the head, which the latter took as a sign that the blessing uttered by an inferior creature for a superior should not be dismissed as worthless.” [I have stuck more closely to the text of the Talmud than did the author here. Ed.] G’d here blessed Avram, with becoming the one who would preach monotheism including awareness of the benevolence of G’d which He extends to all of His creatures.

Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5

ויצאו ללכת ארצה כנען, a land of which they had heard that it was singularly suited for people of their religious beliefs, a land in which the true G’d could be worshipped without hindrance.
ויבאו ארצה כנען, as opposed to Terach, who had also set out originally to go to the land of Canaan but had stopped at Charan, these people with Avram at their head made good on their intention.


Verse 6

ויעבר אברם בארץ, Avram did not stop anywhere in his journey south through the land of Canaan until G’d appeared to him as He had said: “to the land which I will show you.” (verse 1).


Verse 7



Verse 8

בית אל מים והעי מקדם, between two large cities, in order to attract large crowds who could hear him preach.

Verse 9

הלוך ונסוע הנגבה, when he journeyed, as is the custom of shepherds, he did not move to the east and to the west alternately, but kept moving in a southerly direction. He did this in order not to deviate from moving between one of the two towns he had been between when he first stopped between Bet El and Ai. Members of those cities had begun to trail him planning to join him.

Verse 10

לגור שם, not to settle there permanently.

Verse 11

כאשר הקריב, close to the time when it became necessary to take such precautions, so that he would not forget.
לבא מצרימה, a country which was equivalent to a giant brothel. This is mentioned even more forcefully in Ezekiel 23,20 where the prophet describes the carnal attitudes of the Egyptians as אשר בשר חמורים בשרם, וזרמת סוסים זרמתם, “those whose flesh is the flesh of donkeys, and whose sperm is the sperm of horses.” 


Verse 12

והרגו אותי, because they do not expect me to agree to give you to them.

Verse 13

למען ייטב לי, so that when you will say that you are my sister, each one will entertain the hope that I will agree to your marrying them. Therefore, none of them will have any reason to kill me. Rather, he will seek my approval by offering me a dowry for you. It was the custom in those days that the father of the bride would be bribed with money or its equivalent to agree to let his daughter marry someone. This also explains why the Torah speaks of מהר ימהרנה in Exodus 22,15-16, i.e. “he (the seducer) shall pay a heavy dowry,” and why the option to refuse such a marriage is not so much the girl’s but her father’s, as we see from the verse following.

Verse 14

ויראו המצרים, all of them, when looking at Sarai, entertained the very thoughts Avraham had anticipated.

Verse 15

ויראו אותה שרי פרעה, they quickly quashed any hopes the commoners had entertained relating to marrying this woman.

Verse 16

ותקח האשה ולאברם היטיב, the members of Pharaoh’s household did not even waste time to seduce Sarai but abducted her forcefully. They thought that seeing that it was a compliment for Sarai to be desired by the king himself, she would automatically consent to such an elevation of her status. Seeing that she had described herself only as Avram’s sister and not his wife, they had no reason to believe that there was a legal obstacle to such a union. Pharaoh himself said “I took her as a wife for myself,” not a concubine, not a mistress. In verse 19 he explains that he had taken Sarai as a wife, feeling certain that she was not legally linked to any other man.

Verse 17

וינגע ה' את פרעה נגעים גדולים, only Pharaoh was struck with “great” afflictions, 
whereas his household suffered lesser afflictions. This was arranged by G’d so that the Egyptians, when they saw that only Sarai had remained completely immune to these afflictions, would conclude that the afflictions were on account of her and her fate.

Verse 18

למה לא הגדת לי, even if you had reason to suspect the ordinary citizens would harm you on account of her, surely you could have told me, the king, the truth, seeing that it is my task to rule with justice.

Verse 19

?למה אמרת אחותי היא, even after she had already been brought to my palace?
ואקח אותה לי לאשה, so that I took her to be my wife, not my concubine. I though that seeing that she is your sister you would surely approve of this union!

Chapter 13

Verse 2

ואברם כבד מאד במקנה, this is why he had to travel slowly, even though he wanted to return quickly to the site of the altar where he wanted to continue his preaching as he had done before the famine.

Verse 3

וילך למסעיו, this is why he traveled on his routes, i.e. the routes all the shepherds took when journeying in that direction.

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6

ולא נשא אותם הארץ, the grazing land available in that region was inadequate for their combined herds.

Verse 7

ויהי ריב בין רועי מקנה אברם ובין רועי מקנה לוט, there was an argument between who would succeed to drive out the other from the available grazing land they would find.
והכנעני והפריזי אז יושב בארץ. This is why a quarrel between two brothers who lived side by side was especially embarrassing and harmful to the image of Avram among the surrounding tribes. When those tribes would see the brothers quarrel, they would assume that neither of them was a peace-loving individual and they would reason that they had even more reason to quarrel with either one of those recent immigrants.


Verse 8

ביני ובינך, in the future. When either one of them would select for his herds a certain grazing area.
אל נא תהי מריבה, the result of competing aspirations to the same grazing land.
ובין רועי ובין רועיך, now that we dwell here.


Verse 9

הלא כל הארץ לפניך, I’ll let you choose the area which you prefer. 
Therefore, הפרד נא מעלי, move away from me in the direction you prefer and I will move in the opposite direction. If you select grazing land to the left, I will select grazing land to the right.

Verse 10



Verse 11

ויבחר לו לוט, he selected as much area as he himself with his shepherds would manage to control as their grazing land. In this section of the earth Avram and his shepherds would not be allowed to graze. 
ויסע לוט מקדם, he did not turn right or left which were north and south, but he moved from the east to the west to distance himself from Avram [the author translated מקדם as meaning “from the east,” though this is difficult to reconcile with the fact that the Jordan valley is east from the region of Bet El and Ai where Avram and Lot had been reported last in verse 3. The area of the Jordan valley was the area from which the Israelites under the leadership of Joshua would enter the land of Canaan (Joshua chapter 4)


Verse 12

אברם ישב בארץ כנען, even though the city of Sodom and its satellite towns are on the border of the land of Canaan, the people living in those cities at that time, were not Canaanites. It was therefore in order for the Torah to write that Avram- as opposed to Lot- settled in the land of Canaan. He settled in the part of the land inhabited by Canaanites. They were not as evil as the Sodomites. Avram did not move close to the boundary of Sodom at all.

Verse 13



Verse 14

אחרי הפרד לוט, G’d did not say what follows while Lot was still in Avram’s company, so that the latter would not boast and his shepherds would engage in stealing grazing land from the local inhabitants claiming G’d’s promise to Avram of future possession as their justification.

לך אתננה, for even in your own lifetime you will be regarded as a prince of G’d, and deserving of great honour (compare Genesis 23,6)

Verse 18

ויאהל אברם, an expression denoting the encamping, erecting one’s many tents.

Chapter 14



Verse 1

ויהי בימי אמרפל מלך שנער, who was widely known as a powerful king in his generation and also later. During his lifetime the kings listed forthwith, i.e. Aryoch, king of Elassar, Kedorlaomer, king of Eylam, and Tidal, king of Goyim, jointly made war against Bera, etc.

Verse 2



Verse 3

כל אלה, all the ones just named, Amrafel and the two groups that conducted the war.
חברו אל עמק השדים, gathered in that valley and arrived at a compromise concerning the dispute between them. From that time on, the five kings and their subjects served Kedorlaomer, paying him taxes for 12 years, after which they rebelled.


Verse 4

עבדו את כדרלעמר, after the compromise they had reached 12 years ago. Afterwards, they rebelled.

Verse 5

והמלכים אשר אתו, the ones who had been signatories to the compromise deal 12 years previously, amongst whom had also been Amrafel.
ויכו את הרפאים...ואת הזוזים...ואת האימים, all of these people had been subservient to the group of 5 kings headed by the king of Sodom, and had even fought wars on behalf of their masters. By telling us all this, the Torah wanted us to know that the five kings were not just paper tigers, pushovers. By inference, it enables us to imagine the military power of the four kings who defeated the five kings afterwards. Having once appreciated all this, we can image what a tremendous feat Avram accomplished when he defeated the four kings under the leadership of Kedorleomer. He must have possessed outstanding military skills in order to have accomplished this. It also testifies to the act of selfless love he displayed for his nephew, when he endangered himself and his men to such a degree in order to free him from captivity. Most of all, it gives us a chance to marvel at the mercy G’d showed both to Lot and to Avram in this sequence of events.

Verse 10

וינוסו מלך סדום, this made it plain that Avram could not rely on them that they would help him.
והנשארים הרה נסו, the remaining three kings. 


Verse 11



Verse 12

ויקחו את לוט בן אחי אברם, they made a special effort to capture Lot because he was Avram’s nephew. They were aware of his wealth. They were expecting that Avram would pay a heavy ransom for the release of his nephew.

Verse 13

ויגד לאברם העברי, this refugee had no idea that Lot was related to Avram. He only knew that Lot’s religious beliefs were similar to those of Avram.
והוא שוכן באלוני ממרא, this is why Aner, Eshkol, and Mamre participated in the war with Avram, and why he insisted in verse 24 that they receive their share of the loot.


Verse 14

 וירדוף עד רן, in his pursuit to attack them suddenly.

Verse 15

ויחלק עליהם לילה, he divided his forces all around them to make them believe that they were being attacked by large forces from several fronts. We have been told about a similar situation in Kings II 7,6 when the Aramites fled headlong after hearing noises that convinced them that they were being attacked by large forces.
לילה, this was also part of the subterfuge, preventing the kings from realising that they were facing insignificant numbers of opponents. In Samuel II 17,1 this was the advice to Avshalom by Achitofel when he advised to pursue David at night.
ויכם, the defeat caused them to flee.
 וירדפם, the beginning of all pursuits is putting people to flight.


Verse 16

וגם את הנשים, he liberated Lot’s wives, as well as 
העם, all the ordinary people of Sodom who had been taken captive. It was these whom the King of Sodom asked to be restored to him, when he “graciously” (verse 21) offered that Avram could keep the chattels.


Verse 17



Verse 18

הוציא לחם ויין, to all those returning from battle who were tired.
והוא כהן, it was appropriate therefore that he should intone blessings.


Verse 19

ויברכהו ויאמר ברוך אברם לאל עליון, first he blessed on his own behalf. Then he added that Avram was also blessed by the Supreme G’d. He said basically the same as G’d Himself had said to Avram in 12,2.
קונה שמים וארץ, heaven and earth are His, to do with as He pleases. They do not have a will of their own as some scientists believe. G’d alone works His will on them, using them according to His will.


Verse 20

וברוך אל עליון, this power G’d gave to Avram to enable him to overcome his enemies, is a blessing for the Lord. He is able to rejoice in the deeds of His creatures when the wicked perish, and when He makes the righteous rejoice in their success. David expressed it in these words in Psalms 117,1-2 שבחוהו כל האומים גי גבר עלינו חסדו, “Praise the Lord all you nations. Extol Him, all you peoples; for great is His steadfast love toward us;”

Verse 21



Verse 22



Verse 23

אם מחוט ועד שרוך נעל, every time the word אם occurs in Scripture and is not followed by a verb making it a conditional statement, it is used instead of the word שלא, “so that not.” Avram’s statement here means: “I have sworn an oath not to give you even a shoelace or a length of thread as I do not own any of these things. Conversely, I will also not take (accept) anything that is (was) yours.” G’d said something similar to the Jewish people after the debacle of the spies in Numbers 14,23) when He said אם יראו את הארץ, which is a way of saying that they will most certainly not get to see the land (of Israel). In verse 30 in the same chapter the words אם אתם תבאו also mean “you will certainly not come.” Similarly, Samuel I 15,6 חי ה' אם יומת, means “an oath to G’d that he will not be executed, etc.” Also, in Kings II 5,16 חי ה' אשר עמדתי לפניו אם אקח וגו', means: “As the Lord lives whom I serve, I will not accept anything.” There are many similar examples.

Verse 24

בלעדי , “you have said: give me the people, and keep the loot,” I have no intention of taking anything, as I am not even exercising control over any of it.”
רק אשר אכלו הנערים וחלק האנשים, this alone is what they will take from the spoils of war which used to be yours. Avram, who had to supply provisions for his soldiers out of his own pocket, etc., said: I will use only what is needed to reimburse myself as well as the men with me.
אבל ענר אשכול וממרא הם יקחו חלקם, I will neither give them a share, nor will I accept a share on their behalf, but they will themselves take the share they are entitled to.


Chapter 15



Verse 1

אל תירא אברם, do not worry that the four kings will avenge themselves on you.
שכרך, not only that, but your reward over and beyond that is so great that your merits have not decreased on account of your success in that battle. You deserve much more reward for having gone to the assistance of your brother, displaying a supreme degree of love for him and for those belonging to him. You have liberated the victims of kidnappers.
הרבה מאד, both in this world
 and in the world to come. We have been taught, and recite daily in our prayers, that there are things for which one receives some dividends in this world, whereas the principal comes due in the hereafter. One of the good deeds which qualify for such reward is known as גמילות חסדים, the performing of deeds of loving kindness involving not only one’s checkbook but one’s very body (Peah, 1,1).


Verse 2

?מה תתן לי, a reference to the reward in this life.
ערירי, “I have no son who can take my place.” Compare Jeremiah 22,30 כתבו את האיש הזה ערירי כי לא יצלח מזרעו איש יושב על כסא דוד, “record this man as without succession; one who shall never be found successful, for none of his offspring will be accepted to sit on the throne of David.” (the subject of this curse is כניהו son and heir of Yehoyakim) 
ובן משק ביתי הוא דמשק אליעזר, he is only a slave, known only in his home town. There can be no question but that similar actions performed by a slave who is in constant fear of his master’s disapproval, even if in fact the same as those performed by the master’s son, are different in quality, and in effect from one another. The same chores performed by the son are motivated by love instead of by fear.

Verse 3

בן ביתי יורש אותי, even though, in the end, You will give me biological offspring, as You have said in 12,7 לזרעך אתן את הארץ הזאת, “I will give this land to your descendants,” such children will only be minors at the time, so that my servant Eliezer will have to raise them and guide them, in effect being my heir.

Verse 4

לא יירשך זה כי אם אשר יצא ממעיך, for the son would succeed taking over Avram’s leadership role amongst large number of followers while his father was still alive. This is the true meaning of Genesis 25, 5-6 ויתן אברהם את כל אשר לו ליצחק בנו.... בעודנו חי,” Avraham handed over all that was his to his son Yitzchok while he was still alive.” This is followed by the statement that Avraham sent away the sons of the concubines from the presence of his son Yitzchok.

Verse 5



Verse 6

'והאמין בה, he had full confidence that G’d would carry out all that He had promised, even though to an unprejudiced observer, the matter looked extremely unlikely and unnatural.
ויחשבה לו צדקה, G’d credited Avram with having performed an act of faith which deserved to be described as an act of righteousness. This verse was written primarily in order to prevent us from considering Avram’s query במה אדע כי אירשנה, as an expression of doubt in G’d’s promise to him. (verse 8) If Avram had retracted even in the slightest from his firm trust in G’d’s promise, what would have been the point in the Torah explicitly telling us that G’d rated his trust as so praiseworthy? Ezekiel, dealing with such fickle faith in G’d, asks ובשוב צדיק מצדקתו ויעשה עול...כל צדקותיו אשר עשה לא תזכרנה “if a righteous person were to renege from his righteousness and commit evil, none of the righteous deeds he had ever performed would be worth mentioning.” (Ezekiel 18,24)

Verse 7

אשר הוצאתיך מאור כשדים לתת לך את הארץ הזאת, for you, personally, will acquire this land by an act of taking symbolic possession of it. 
לרשתה, so that the children (descendants) would inherit it from you under the heading of an inheritance, i.e. without any interruption in this land being owned by Israelites.


Verse 8

במה אדע, for possibly my descendants will sin and forfeit their claim to this land.

Verse 9

קחה לי עגלה, take a heifer for Me, in order to enter into a covenant concerning this assurance. Converting G’d’s promise into what is known as a “covenant,” is equivalent to G’d reinforcing His promise by an oath, something which is unconditional and irrevocable. (Rosh Hashanah 18) Moses himself confirmed this interpretation when he said (Deut 9,5)  “not due to your righteousness or the uprightness of your heart, but due to the wickedness of these nations does G’d dispossess them on your account; and in order to keep His promise which He had sworn to your forefathers Avraham, Yitzchok and Yaakov 

Verse 10

Verse 12



Verse 13

ידוע תדע, here G'd informed Avram why it would take such a long time before His promise to Avraham that his descendants would inherit the land of Canaan could be fulfilled. G'd would not be justified in expelling a nation from its homeland until its measure of sin is full to overflowing. Therefore G'd told Avram ידוע תדע כי גר יהיה זרעך בארץ לא להם, that his own descendants would be strangers in a land which is not theirs until such time as the local inhabitants could legally be expelled by G'd from the land of Canaan. At the same time, He also told him about what would happen to his descendants in the interval, i.e. enslavement, cruel oppression, etc., for at least some of the intervening years. However, G'd implied that such suffering would not occur during the periods when Avram's descendants would be righteous. We know from the dates when the sons of Yaakov died, that as long as even a single one of them survived, no restrictions of any kind were imposed on the Israelites in Egypt, in spite of their having increased at a phenomenal rate already. All of these developments are attested to in Ezekiel in 20, 8-9 when he referred to the descendants of Yaakov in Egypt becoming rebellious and refusing to honour their tribal obligations vis-à-vis the G'd of Avraham-Yitzchok, and Yaakov. The reason why the prophet dragged up such ancient history was only in order to make plain to the newly exiled nation that their misfortunes had always been due only to their betrayal of their covenant with G'd. Compare Isaiah 48,5 ואגיד לך מאז בטרם תבא השמעתיך פן תאמר עצבי עשם וגו' "therefore I told you long beforehand, announced things to you ere they happened; that you might not say: 'my idol cause them, my carved and molten images ordained them."


Verse 14

וגם את הגוי אשר יעבדו דן אנכי, just as I judge your descendants, for the wickedness with enslavement and cruel suppression, so I will judge the nation that enslaves them."

Chapter 16



Verse 1



Verse 2

הנה עצרני ה' מלדת, "even though G'd has promised to grant you offspring to whom I will give this land, (Genesis 12,7) He has not said that the mother of Avram's offspring would be I."
	אולי אבנה ממנה, Sarah hoped that the jealousy which would develop within her when she saw that Hagar gave birth to a child for Avram would stimulate her own biological and sexual urges so that in due course she too would become pregnant by her husband. (based on Megillah 13)
	שרי לקול, the Torah wants to make plain that Avram was not motivated by sexual lust to sleep with Hagar, but had only fallen in with Sarai's reasoning, hoping to assuage her feelings in the matter.
