Chapter 1



Verse 1

בראשית, at the beginning of time; this is the first moment which is indivisible into shorter periods.. There had not been a concept “time” previous to this, i.e. there had only been unbroken continuity. (The author perceives “time” as one of the creations. Ed.]
ברא, He had converted “nothing” into “something.” There had been no need to invoke “time” in order to accomplish this.
אלוקים, The expression “elo-ha” refers to something enduring, eternal. This is why Moses (Deut. 32,17) refers to demons, שדים, as לא אלו-ה, seeing that they are not eternal, are subject to death as our sages taught (Chagigah 16) The reason that the term “elo-ha” here appears in the plural mode, i.e. “elo-him,” is to teach us that G’d is the origin of all the various visible and invisible manifestations in the universe. This is what the prophet (Isaiah 6,3) has in mind when he described G’d as מלא כל הארץ כבודו, “the entire globe is a manifestation of His glory.” There is no other existence unless it has emanated from His existence. This is what Nechemyah 9,6 had in mind when he said ואתה מחיה את כלם, “You provide life for all of them.” When speaking of “appearances,” every phenomenon which is abstract as distinct from being tangible, is described by the generic term אלוקים. Professional, i.e. expert judges are called אלוהים, as they are able to pronounce judgment בצלם אלוקים, reflecting Divine wisdom. Their very profession is testimony to something enduring, divine in nature.
את השמים, the word שם refers to a place which is distant, as opposed to the word פה, which means “here.” Every plural mode when accompanied by an accented penultimate syllable vocalised with a patach signals 2 of something which are equi-distant from all sides. This is something possible only in connection with an orbiting planet. This is something which is not possible, i.e that two points are equidistant from the center unless they are part of an orbiting spherical planet. The Torah therefore says that G’d created the phenomenon which at this time is far distant from us in such a way that all its sides are equi-distant from us, in other words the phenomenon is a planet, something spherical.
ואת הארץ, and the center which is orbited by the planet.


Verse 2

והארץ היתה תהו ובהו, “this very center which was created at that time was composed of a mixture of raw materials, known as tohu, and its original external appearance is what  is described as bohu. The reason is that the whole expanse of tohu was comprised of a uniform appearance. This explained that the first raw material was something entirely new. It is described as tohu to indicate that at that point it was merely something which had potential, the potential not yet having materialised, been converted to something actual. When we read in Samuel I 12,21 כי תהו המה, the meaning is that these phenomena did not exist in reality, they existed only in someone’s imagination. [a reference to pagan deities. Ed.] The appearance of this primordial raw material is described as bohu, meaning that as such it came to exist in actual fact, in real terms. Isaiah 34,11 “weights of emptiness.” This describes any phenomenon that does not retain its appearance for any length of time. It constantly changes like a chameleon
וחשך, a reference to the air (atmosphere, totally dark which emanated at that time from the original raw material. על פני תהום, over the expanse of the two basic foundations which also emanated from the same origin and surrounded one another.
ורוח אלוקים, the energy propelling the planet is called ruach,” as we know from Psalms 104,4 עושה מלאכיו רוחות, “He  energises His messengers.”
מרחפת על פני המים, they activated the atmosphere above the waters which at that time surrounded the earth. This is the reason why the part which was closer to the spherical planet became incandescent through its motion [friction. Ed.] This phenomenon is what we know as the original fire. On the other hand, the part of the energy which remained closer to the waters acquired a degree of frigidity from the proximity to the waters, so that only a small part of the atmosphere really became hot through revolving and giving off sparks of fiery light. 

Verse 3



Verse 4

וירא אלוקים את האור כי טוב, This describes the reason why G’d created the light, not that He “saw”” something new which He had not been aware of previously. It was because it was “good,” that G’d had created the light.
ויבדל אלוקים בין האור ובין החשך, the days (prior to the fourth day when the sun was placed in orbit) during which use was made of the “original light,” periods of light and darkness alternated due to causes other than the revolving of the planet around its own axis, i.e. due to the direct expression of G’d’s desire. He ensured that periods of light alternated with periods of darkness.


Verse 5

ויקרא אלוקים לאור יום; even though at that stage of creation “time” was not yet an operative term as we know it nowadays, i.e. the terms “day” and “night” were not yet used by anyone, G’d named these phenomena as such already at that time.
ויהי ערב ויהי בקר, although G’d had made a separation between the light and the darkness, assigning to each different time frames in which to be active, independent of the planet earth revolving on its axis, He arranged for a transition from one phenomenon to the other to take place gradually, step by step. This occurred by means of inserting a period known as evening preceding total night, and a period of dawn preceding bright sunlight, daylight.


Verse 6

יהי רקיע בתוך המים, let there be טבע, i.e. guidelines, rules governing the function of what is below and what is above the primordial waters. Just as there are such parameters surrounding our world, i.e. the globe we call “earth,” so there should be similar guidelines governing what is below the atmosphere and earth itself. The region in which air exists should become clearly defined. [the gaseous nature of air should not be allowed to escape into all directions of the universe beyond our globe so that creatures on earth would die from the lack of air. In other words, the atmosphere should be “enclosed” whether by gravitational or other forces is immaterial. Ed.] At the same time, air should be given enough space within which “to breathe,” so to speak.

Verse 7



Verse 8

ויקרא אלוקים לרקיע שמים. Seeing that activities occurring in the celestial regions reach us by means of G’d’s agents and not directly, the Torah had to tell us that G’d named the phenomenon, otherwise we would not have known this, [would have considered it as a result of an evolutionary process. Ed.]  We know of this indirect activity of G’d when the Torah referred (verses 17-18) to “G’d placed them (the luminaries) in the רקיע השמים, and assigned to them the task to illuminate the earth, etc.”

Verse 9

יקוו המים; this does not mean that the waters should dry up, as many people interpreted it. These people said that the process would be achieved by a substantial part of the oceans freezing and turning to ice such as the polar regions, and that this would be caused by forces in the celestial regions. אל מקום אחד. The waters should not deviate from this location. As a result they became much higher than the surrounding land mass without crashing down on earth as our senses would have us think would be the case. This is why David tells us in Psalms 104,9: גבול שמת בל יעברון, “You have set them limits which they must not cross.” The meaning is that the waters must not flood the earth.” 

Verse 10

ויקרא אלוקים ליבשה ארץ, G’d assigned a name which is applicable to the whole also to parts of it. The reason is that the particular part of the “earth” described previously as merely יבשה, is in reality the most important and productive part of the “earth.” (based on Moreh Nevuchim) Isaiah 45,18 already referred to this when he said of earth that לשבת יצרה, “G’d formed it in order that it be populated,” i.e. subterranean earth is of secondary importance, seeing one cannot cultivate it and make it one’s habitat.

Verse 11

דשא, herbs fit for consumption by animals. We find this expression used in this sense in Yoel 2,22כי דשאו נאות מדבר, “for its herbs (the ones for the beasts) are found in the pastures of the wilderness.”
עשב מזריע זרע, for consumption by human beings.
עץ פרי עושה פרי למינו, if it were a mixture of more than one species it would not be able to reproduce itself.
ויהי כן, it endured, in its original format, not becoming adulterated nor shedding any of its individuality. Had it absorbed parts of competing species it could not have procreated itself.


Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14

יהי מאורות ברקיע השמים, the planets created on the second day should now begin to function by providing light. Their influence should be concentrated on the “lower” universe, as it is visible to us with our senses. Everything mentioned in this paragraph refers to sensations perceived by the creatures on earth. By traversing pure waters on the way to earth, the light refracted by these luminaries is increased manifold.

Verse 15

להאיר על הארץ, they should dispense their light at a time when it is beneficial for the inhabitants of the earth.
ויהי כן, G’d’s directive was executed and became a permanent feature of natural law.


Verse 16

ויעש...ויתן...להאיר...ולמשול..ולהבדיל..כי טוב, all of these expressions refer to the luminaries and the other stars. The Torah first writes: ויעש, seeing that up until that point sun and moon had simply been part of all the other celestial bodies which had been created on the second day, or of “heaven,” whose creation had already been reported in verse 1. This is the reason why at this stage the Torah does not call the development of these luminaries an act of creation, ויברא or something similar, but merely writes ויעש, which describes the completion of a process that had already been begun previously. At this stage, G’d singled out these two luminaries from among all the planets and assigned them their function
The word כי טוב, “that it was good,” describes G’d’s impression after He had removed these luminaries from their original place in the universe, given them spherical shape so that they can orbit, and function as luminaries.


Verse 17



Verse 18

ולמשול ביום ובלילה, in order to bring new creatures into life in the “lower” regions of the universe, i.e. these living creatures, as opposed to the plants, required more than the light G’d had created on the first day. Seeing they are more important and more sophisticated beings they require exposure to better light in order to flourish.
ולהבדיל בין האור ובין החושך, to establish clear demarcations amongst the inhabitants of the lower regions of the universe, between when these respective luminaries were to shine, and when they were to set, i.e. to disappear from view. Basically, the meaning is the same as in verse 14 above.


Verse 19



Verse 20

יעופף על הארץ על פני רקיע השמים, in order to cleanse the air of the atmosphere for the benefit of the inhabitants of the earth from any excessive moisture in the air which had resulted through the creation of the rakia on the second “day.”

Verse 21

ויברא אלוקים את התנינים, the evolutionary powers of the waters did not suffice for this task. They could not produce the original sea-monsters without having been provided for this with seed by the Creator.

Verse 22

ויברך אותם אלוקים, seeing there were so many of them they would not achieve their purpose in this universe without such a Divine blessing.

Verse 23



Verse 24

תוצא הארץ נפש חיה, earth should produce living creatures possessing a quality of life superior to that of the plants.
ויהי כן, it was exactly so, i.e. without omissions or additions. If any of the components of these creatures (genes) were to be missing, they would lose the ability to procreate in kind.


Verse 25



Verse 26

ויאמר אלוקים נעשה, at this point G’d endowed His entourage to carry out the task assigned to it.
אדם, another one of the species referred to as נפש חיה, one known as אדם. This is why we read in Genesis 2,7 ויהי האדם לנפש חיה, “Adam became one of the species known as נפש חיה.”
בצלמנו, a species designed to live forever seeing that it is predominantly intellectual. By doing this, G’d provided an opening by means of His Torah to acquire an understanding of the nature of purely spiritual, disembodied beings such as angels. Our soul has been given the key to understand something about the nature of such beings.
כדמותנו, acting intelligently like the angels, though from free choice, not like the angels who act under Divine compulsion. In this respect, though the angels are celestial beings, they do not resemble man. In this respect man is a little more like G’d Himself than are the angels, though our habitat is in the “lower” regions of the universe. The principal difference between G’d’s total freedom of action and that of man’s is that G’d’s freedom of action is always put to a constructive use, whereas man frequently abuses his G’d given freedom to oppose the expressed will of His Creator. At any rate, not being hampered by the limitations imposed by having a body, the qualitative freedom of G’d is far superior to that of man, and this is why the Torah uses the comparative כדמותנו, to show that the comparison is limited.


Verse 27

בצלם אלוקים, when the word אלוקים appears as a description, i.e. in the nature of an adjective, it refers to creatures who are spiritual in their essence, not just that they possess spiritual potential. Such beings are devoid of such physical matter, are totally disembodied. This is what makes them basically infinite. This is the reason why such an adjective, attribute, is applied to G’d as well as to His angels. The term is also used in connection with judges, i.e. describing the predominating intellectual function they must perform if their decisions are to reflect true justice. Whereas it is an undisputed fact that the human intellect operates without direct dependence on any part of the body, that it does not age along with the remainder of the body it inhabits, but, on the contrary, sometimes improves while the body ages and becomes barely able to sustain the soul which inhabits it, and while it is also a fact that exercise of the intellect does not result in fatigue, etc, it is still not called אלוקים, something divine, but only צלם אלוקים, “something which mirrors something divine.” Until this intellect has acquired חכמה, i.e. a reverence for G’d and love for Him, its Creator, it is completely imperfect. It follows that it is man’s task to perfect his G’d given intelligence by acquiring the knowledge and insights which can be provided only by the study of Torah and by the practice of the laws of the Torah. If man, i.e. religiously atheistic intellectuals, do not use their intellect in the manner G’d meant for them to use it, it actually becomes a negative asset, a hindrance, so that in the end it turns out to be completely vain, as pointed out in Psalms 49,21 אדם ביקר ולא יבין נמשל כבהמות ידמו, “if man does not understand the divine gift his intellect represents he is comparable to the beasts which perish.” This entire lesson is condensed in the two words בצלם אלוקים.

Verse 28

וכבשה, this is not a directive to conquer earth with muscular power, but to subdue it by means of man’s superior intellect. It means that man is to use his intelligence to prevent predators from invading his habitats, demonstrating the fact that man is superior, can outwit the beasts.
ורדו, trapping the beasts, training them to bend to man’s will.


Verse 29

הנה נתתי לכם, as food to be consumed by man.

Verse 30

ולכל חית הארץ, but to all the beasts on earth including the birds and the domesticated animals I have allocated את כל ירק עשב, different kinds of herbs which are not generating seed.


Verse 31

את כל אשר עשה והנה טוב מאד, the accomplishment of a project containing many different parts is greater than the accomplishment of each part of such project successfully. Now that G’d had completed the entire project successfully, the Torah described this with the additional word מאד instead of merely טוב. 
יום הששי, this is the first day which is described as “the (sixth) day.” In other words, it was the first of many days known as “the sixth,” but this was the first such day. The specific function of the sixth day is to be the bridge between the ordinary weekdays and the Sabbath. The “six” days have been defined in Exodus 20,9-10 as the days on which “you will perform all your tasks involving work.”


Chapter 2



Verse 1

 ויכלו, when all the phenomena intended to comprise the physical universe had materialised 

Verse 2

ויכל אלוקים ביום השביעי, at the beginning of the seventh “day,” a moment which is indivisible from the time frame which follows, so that both the six previous “days” were an entity in themselves, and the seventh day was a totally self-contained entity. Our sages in Bereshit Rabbah 10,9 describe G’d as knowing the precise moment between the sixth and seventh day and describe it as “thin as a hair’s breadth.” [I believe the problem confronting the sages was the statement that G’d had completed all His work in the six days, and yet the Torah speaks of Him completing, ויכל, His work on the ”seventh” day, something that appears to be a contradiction to the former statement. Ed.] 
וישבות ביום השביעי, G’d’s inactivity on the seventh day set it apart from the previous six days.


Verse 3

ויברך אלוקים את יום השביעי, this refers not only to the first Sabbath but to all subsequent Sabbath days. G’d endowed every Sabbath with this blessing so that it would more readily accommodate the additional “soul” He grants Jews on that day. Job 33,30 describes this phenomenon as לאור באור החיים, “designed that he may bask in the light of life.” Our sages (Beytzah 16) state that the words שבת וינפש in Exodus 31,17 refer to the loss of this additional soul at the end of the Sabbath. 

Verse 4

אלה תולדות השמים והארץ בהבראם. These are the plants and the living creatures which had been the potential derivatives of heaven and earth already at the time when heaven and earth were first created. The potential ability for heaven and earth to produce the inhabitants of their respective domains was inherent in their respective composition from the first moment of their existence. When the Torah, in its very first verse, wrote the words את השמים and את הארץ, this was already an allusion to the additional factors which had been created together with heaven and earth, i.e. their ability to produce their respective derivatives.
ביום עשות ה' אלוקים ארץ ושמים, this potential was translated into an actual only on the day when G’d completed עשות, i.e. arranged in detail how these derivatives were to function and where and when. This occurred after the six “days” of creative activity. Only when that stage had been reached was G’d referred to in the Torah by His full name, i.e. ה' אלוקים.


Verse 5

טרם יהיה בארץ, these words emphasise that although all phenomena had been created, this referred to their potential, not to their functioning as they do nowadays. כל עשב השדה, had not yet sprouted,
כי לא המטיר, for G’d had not yet made it rain in such a fashion that it enabled the latent power of these plants to fully develop.


Verse 6

ואד יעלה מן הארץ, on the day they were completed, i.e. at the end of the sixth “day” a vapour rose from the earth equivalent to beneficial dew which irrigated the earth and enabled it to bring forth further vegetation without the help of rain or man’s labour.

Verse 7

וייצר ה' אלוקים, the animals had not rated involvement of both attributes of G’d in their creation and formation. Not only that, but in order to create man G’d had used עפר מן האדמה, the choicest of the dust available on earth. Moreover,
ויפח באפיו נשמת חיים, G’d personally blew a soul of life into man, a life force which had been readied to absorb what was previously called צלם אלוקים, “the image of G’d.” This has been attested to in Job 32,8 ונשמת שדי תבינם,”by means of the breath of the attribute of Shaddai You endowed them with understanding.” At any rate, ויהי האדם לנפש חיה, man had remained a living creature  (similar to the animals) until You equipped him with a divine-like tzelem and demut.


Verse 8

אשר יצר, after G’d had created man in a manner appropriate to his superior status on earth, He placed him in Gan Eden, a location which was suitable to equip him with the צלם אלוקים, the divine image, enabling him to also fulfill the intellectual tasks involving the air and food in the garden.

Verse 9

ויצמח, G‘d made the food necessary for Adam sprout forth. The verse illustrates with what ease Adam could secure his requirements in Gan Eden.
נחמד למראה, looking at these trees resulted In the viewer experiencing intellectual stimulation both of his heart and his brain. He would thus be capable of “digesting” the additional intellectual insights granted him by G’d. Compare Kings II 3,15 ותהי עליו יד ה', “Elisha had now been endowed by G’d’s generosity.” [a reference to the additional spiritual insights he had asked from his mentor Elijah prior to the latter ascending to heaven. Ed.]
ועץ הדעת, a tree whose fruit results in those who eat from it gaining greater understanding of the relationship of good and evil. The word דעת, which appears here for the first time, helps us understand Genesis 4,1 והאדם ידע את חוה אשתו. Without this verse we would have been puzzled by the Torah telling us something that was so obvious. Who does not “know” his wife, especially when he had described her as “bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh!” (2,23) In our verse we are told that the words ידע, דעת do not primarily refer to factual knowledge but to conceptual knowledge. This also helps us to understand why relatives, as in Ruth 2,1 are referred to as מודע לאישה, “someone whom her late husband had been intimate with, had been related to by blood.” It is normal for blood relations to be concerned with the physical and emotional needs of their kin. (compare Proverbs 17,17.)
טוב ורע, to choose that which appeared as appealing to the senses even though it would prove harmful, and to despise anything which did not appeal to his senses although he knew it to be useful to him.


Verse 10

ונהר יוצא מעדן, the Torah explains that Adam’s work did not entail anything strenuous, such a carrying pails of water, or such as getting wet in the rain.

Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15

לעבדה, a reference to perfecting his own personality, that which was supplied by G’d in an as yet unrefined state, the one called נשמת חיים. [the author searched to justify the use of the feminine mode in the word לעבדה and related it to נשמה, soul, a noun which is feminine and requires further refinement, just like שיר and שירה which both mean song, the latter, in the feminine mode being unrefined when compared to the former. Compare its use in the haggadah shel Pessach. Ed.]
ולשמרה, eating the fruit of the garden would ensure that man’s natural juices would not dry up. Man is equipped with natural heat, and if not supplied with the proper kind of nourishment he may dehydrate. The excellent fruit of the trees of the garden would replenish loss of moisture through evaporation on the skin in the heat of the sun.


Verse 16

מכל עץ הגן, depending on which tree’s fruit was in season. Each season required nutrients appropriate to the prevailing climate, and the fruit ripening during the various seasons would provide man with these nutrients. The prophet Ezekiel 74,12 expresses this thought in the words לחדשיו יבכר “in its appropriate month it will yield new fruit.”

Verse 17

ומעץ הדעת, the tree in the middle of the garden, in close proximity to the tree of life mentioned previously (verse 9) The meaning of חיים in connection with that tree is equivalent to the meaning of the words in Deuteronomy 30,19 החיים והמות נתתי לפניך, “I have placed life and death (to choose) before you.” [we may understand this to mean that the tree of life, if its fruit were eaten, would result in life of infinite duration, whereas eating from the tree next to it would result in life being shortened. Ed.]

Verse 18

לא טוב היות האדם לבדו, the purpose of the human species on earth will not be achieved while man who is supposed to reflect the divine image will be left to personally carry out all the menial tasks of daily life on earth by being solitary.
עזר כנגדו, a helpmate who will be equal to him, also reflecting the divine image. This is essential for him if he is to know what precisely his needs are and so that he can meet them in time. The reason why the Torah added the word כנגדו is that whenever one confronts someone of equal power, moral and ethical weight, such a confrontation is termed נגד. It is a head-on collision of will. When the two parties disagreeing are not of equal power, or moral/ethical weight, the confrontation is termed as one being עולה or יורד one of the adversaries either prevailing or losing in such an encounter. It is in this sense that we have to understand such statements as משה שקול כנגד כל ישראל, “that Moses was the equal of the entire Jewish people.” (Mechilta Yitro 1)  However, the Torah did not mean for woman to be 100% equal to man, else how could the man expect her to perform household chores for him, etc.? Hence the letter כ at the beginning of the word כנגדו somewhat tones down this equality.


Verse 19

ויצר ה' אלוקים מן האדמה כל חית השדה, G’d now provided these creatures with their final shape, putting the “finishing touches” on them, so to speak. At that stage of the earth’s condition, the original product which the earth had produced, not based on seed which contains all the genetic material in microscopic form, was not adequate to produce the final product without input by G’d, personally.
ויבא אל האדם, in order for man to realise there was a need for an additional phenomenon, seeing that amongst the existing ones none met his need for a partner.
לראות מה יקרא לו, so that he would see which name would be appropriate for each creature, based on the specific tasks they performed in the universe.
נפש חיה הוא שמו, its name would provide all of us with a clue as to its function in G’d’s scheme of things. The essence of each animal, נפש, would be revealed by its activity on earth.


Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22

ויבן ה' אלוקים את הצלע לאשה, it was someone possessing the features of a human being, much like those of a man. She would be different from man only in some external physical features. She would possess the same ability to perfect her personality as did man.

Verse 23

זאת, this female הפעם הזאת, finally, this timeעצם מעצמי ובשר מבשרי, only this time, seeing that all females of the future will not be fashioned by the male undergoing such type of surgery.
לזאת יקרא אשה, all other female human beings in the future will be known as אשה, 
even though they will not, like this time, be literally part of the flesh of their husbands.
כי מאיש לוקחה זאת, “this one,” the first woman ever.

Verse 24

על כן, seeing that on this first occasion G’d had aimed to make Adam’s wife as much part of him as possible, so that he even used Adam’s personal body as Chavah’s basic skeleton, יעזוב איש את אביו ואת אמו ודבק באשתו, it is appropriate that a man leave the home of his parents in order to acquire a wife who is compatible with him, and who is a suitable mate for him to live with on a permanent basis. The Torah teaches here also that the expression דיבוק, “cleaving,” being in a state of true union, is not possible between two people who are not alike in their common purpose in life. Parents and children do not have the same tasks and challenges. Man and his wife do have to master the same challenges, hence the word “union” can be applied to their union, whereas the same word would be inappropriate for describing the relationship between father and son, or mother and son. By living together they will become of one mind on how to deal with their lives’ challenges.
 והיו לבשר אחד, they are to work together in such close union as if there were in fact only one of them. (This had been the idea behind creating man as both male and female in the first place.)


Verse 25

ערומים ולא יתבוששו, because while in that state of innocence all their activities were aimed at pleasing their Creator. When this is the case, one has no reason to feel ashamed of anything. Just as eating and drinking was an activity they engaged in, in order to remain healthy and be able to carry out the tasks assigned to them by G’d, so marital intercourse was an activity designed exclusively to fulfill the commandments to produce more members of their species. Instead of using hands and feet to carry out other aspects of G’d’s will, in this instance they had to use their genitals for this purpose.

Chapter 3



Verse 1

והנחש, another word for Satan, which itself is a way of describing the evil urge. (Baba Batra 16). The reason why this evil urge is compared to a serpent is that just like a serpent which makes itself as invisible as possible, blending in with its environment, and yet causes more damage than the most prominently visible obstacles, so the evil urge lurks where one does not suspect to find it. It is a common practice to name phenomena according to other well known phenomena, such as calling the king “lion,” to show what is expected of a king, i.e. strength, fearlessness, etc. (compare Jeremiah 4,7 “the lion has come up from his thicket,” a reference to King Nevuchadnezzar) Also in Jeremiah 8,17 Israel’s enemies are referred to as נחשים צפעונים אשר אין להם לחש, “adders which cannot be charmed.” G’d, using a metaphor, calls the evil urge נחש, in our verse. Anything or anybody who leads Israel into sin is termed נחש. The reason why a serpent has been chosen for such a metaphor is that it is a creature whose potential harm is huge, whereas its potential benefit to man is minimal. Moreover, seeing that its visibility is minimal, it is similar to the evil urge who never attacks frontally, and often poses as friend rather than as enemy. Our sages in Pirkey de Rabbi Eliezer chapter 13 already enlarged on this metaphor by describing Samael as riding the serpent, meaning “taking advantage of this power of imagination.” The insidious nature of the evil urge consists of the fact that it conjures up in our imagination something desirable, which because of its desirability we rationalize into considering as harmless, harbouring no physical or spiritual danger for us. Greed, lust, combined with one’s imagination is a powerful tool for leading man into sin. Unless man is able to harness the power of reason against such insidious attempts to trick him into disobedience against G’d by giving in to his desire for gratification of his senses, he will fall victim to the evil urge’s machinations. When our sages (Jerusalem Talmud Berachot 1.8) said עינא ולבא סרסורי דחטאה, “the eyes and the heart are agents of sin,” they referred to the warning against the evil urge we recite twice daily in the last section of the keriyat shema. (Numbers 15,39).
היה ערום מכל חית השדה, for the power of imagination which dangles before our mental eye all sorts of visions designed to stir our desire is more powerful within man than within any other creature This is what the sages meant when they said: (Sukkah 52) “anyone who is of greater stature than his fellow also has to contend with a more powerful evil urge than his fellow.” ויאמר אל האשה, her relatively weak intellect was too lazy to understand that the images dangled before her eyes were a fatah morgana, illusion. אף כי אמר אלוקים, even though G’d has said not to eat from the tree of knowledge פן תמותון, in order that you do not die, this is not true, you will not die. Once the “serpent,” i.e. her power of imagination had sown the seed of doubt in her mind, so that her intelligence had already been undermined, she said: 

Verse 2

עץ הגן נאכלת, “we can eat from the trees of the garden and do not need to endanger our lives by eating from the tree that G’d has prohibited us to eat from on pain of death.” Having said this, however, her power of imagination kept nagging at her weighing the possibility that G’d might indeed be jealous of competition from his creature. Her doubt, i.e. the voice of the evil urge, was expressed in the words 

Verse 3



Verse 4

 לא מות תמותון “you will sure not die,

Verse 5

כי יודע אלוקים כי בים אכלכם ממנו ונפקחו עיניכם, G’d did not forbid this fruit because it is lethal, but because He knows that through eating it you will attain additional knowledge so that you will be just like G’d, possessing total knowledge.

Verse 6

ותרא האשה כי טוב העץ למאכל, she realized that the tree was good to eat due to its location, its nature and the pleasant fragrance of its fruit.
ונחמד העץ להשכיל, seeing that G’d Himself had already described the tree as being the tree of knowledge.
גם לאישה עמה, his heart was open to her words because he was her husband, and because he was by her side.


Verse 7

ותפקחנה עיני שניהם, they compared mentally, the advantages they had gained through the pleasant sensation of eating from the fruit of the tree, and the harm they had caused themselves thereby. The expression פקח implies weighing something carefully with both heart and mind. We find an example of this expression in such a sense in Job 14,3 אף על זה פקחת עינים, “Do you fix your gaze even on such a one?” [Job referring to the transient nature of man and if he is worth G’d’s attention. Ed.]
וידעו כי ערומים הם, they realized that they needed to cover their genitals which in future would serve mainly as organs designed to gratify their physical urges.


Verse 8

מתהלך בגן, back and forth, in accordance with the requirements of their purpose. The word is similar in meaning to Genesis 13,17 where Avraham is instructed by G’d התהלך to “crisscross the land of Canaan, in order to symbolically lay claim to it.” The same construction is also found in Psalms 105,13 ויתהלכו מגוי אל גוי, “they wandered from nation to nation.”
לרוח היום, according to His pleasure on that day. The word רוח is used in the abstract, spiritual sense, not referring to a breeze. This is no different that what G’d had also done during the other days of creation, and as He had been doing on this same day (sixth day of creation) prior to Adam’s sin.
ויתחבא, as the Torah wrote in Deuteronomy 23,15 ולא יראה בך ערות דבר, “no exposure of genitals (or other shameful matters) shall be visible on you.”


Verse 9

איכה, “why are you not in evidence in the garden as previously?” Why did you suddenly see the need to hide?

Verse 10

ואירא, this feeling of fear is similar to that experienced by the Jewish people in Exodus 34,30 when, because of the sin of the golden calf, the people were afraid to face him after his face radiated light when he returned from Mount Sinai. 

Verse 11

מי הגיד לך, who revealed to you the difference between good and evil?
כי עירום אתה, that on account of familiarity with evil you felt the need to cover your genitals.


Verse 12

היא, she, who was meant to be an assistant to me has turned out to be the opposite.
נתנה לי מן העץ, and has become a hindrance instead of a help. By saying these words, Adam tried to blame his Creator for having committed a sin. Adam, instead of being defensive by repenting, apologizing, admitting his guilt, as did David when the prophet Natan had called him to order over his conduct with Bat Sheva, (Samuel II 12,13) 


Verse 13

?מה זאת עשית, G’d used this introduction in order to encourage also the woman to repent her sin. G’d, after all does not want sinners to die but to rehabilitate themselves. We know this from Ezekiel 18,23 and 18,32 לא יחפוץ במות המת כי אם בשובו.

Verse 14

ארור אתה מכל. The serpent was condemned henceforth to attain its needs as well as its desires only through experiencing more pain and greater lack of pleasure than all the other creatures. Compare Kidushin 82 ראית חיה ועוף שהם בני אומנות והם מתפרנסים שלא בצער, “Did you ever see a beast or bird practicing a vocation, and yet they find their livelihood without pain?” [the scholar makes the point that our parnassah lies in the hands of G’d and is not due to our professional level. Ed.] G’d’s curse is explained in detail by the words על גחונך תלך, “you will have to crawl on your belly.” This means that the serpent will find its sustenance only laboriously, experiencing frustration in doing so. Our sages (Berachot 58) mention how many laborious stages the kernel of wheat had to undergo until Adam finally was able to eat the bread that he made out of it.
ועפר תאכל, you will not enjoy the food (or other earthly  pleasures) previously enjoyable. The Talmud Sotah 49 describes something similar happening to the Jewish people  as a whole after the destruction of the Temple, saying: הטהרה נטלה את הטעם ואת הריח, והמעשרות נטלו את שומן הדגן, [the subject being the negative fallout for the entire nation of the destruction of the Temple, Ed.] “previously pleasant tasting and fragrant foods no longer tasted as well with the exception of food which needed to be consumed in a state of ritual purity, and the tithes now assumed the  richness of cereals.”

Verse 15

ואיבה אשית, woman would henceforth be an object of disgust even in her own estimation, as described in the Talmud (Shabbat 152) “although a woman is a vessel full of excrement and her orifice full of blood,” (men run after her as if she was the most desirable creature) This was going to be the relationship between males and females in the future, not only that between Adam and Chavah [who apparently could not bring himself to have intercourse with her for the next 130 years. Ed.]
ובין זרעך ובין זרעה, not only between Adam and Chavah, but also between their respective male and female offspring.
הוא ישופך ראש, these thoughts crossing man’s mind will reduce the satisfaction he obtains already in the early stages of sexual intercourse, a feeling gradually reinforced when he considers the potential harm he may cause himself by indulging in copulation, diminishing both the qualitative and quantitative enjoyment  of it.
ואתה תשופנו עקב, he who initially derives pleasure from his superiority will eventually cause himself harm at the end of the pleasure cycle.


Verse 16

הרבה ארבה עצבונך, the menstrual blood, known in the Torah and Talmud as נדת דותה (Niddah 9 and Leviticus 12,2) The prophet Jeremiah in Lamentations 1,13 describes the state of the Jewish people after the destruction of the Temple as כל היום דוה, as if she lost menstrual blood all day long. 
והרונך, her pregnancy will be exactly the opposite of what it had been before she sinned. Our sages (Bereshit Rabbah 22,22) describe that at that time Adam and Chavah were created, copulated, and produced offspring, all on the same day. This is also what things will be like in the future according to Shabbat 30 “in the future woman will be able to give birth every day.” Such a situation will occur when the Jewish people once more regain G’d’s favour, as had been the case prior to the original sin.
בעצב תלדי בנים, you will experience anguish while engaged in raising them, by comparison to the other creatures on earth who do not experience such prolonged periods during which they have to look after all the needs of their young. The word לידה does appear in the context of raising children (not even one’s own) such as in the case of Michal, daughter of King Sha-ul, wife of David of whom we are told (Samuel II 21,8) חמשת בני מיכל בת שאול אשר ילדה לעדריאל בן ברזילי המחולתי“the five sons of Michal, daughter of Sha-ul whom she had born to Adriel son of Barzilai the Mecholti.” [Michal had not given birth to these five sons, but her older sister Merav, who had died very young so that Michal, her sister, had raised her nephews. Ed.]


Verse 17

כי שמעת לקול אשתך, by attributing to G’d such negative characteristics as lying and jealousy.
ותאכל מן העץ, thereby rebelling and causing yourself death as you had been warned about. Because you listened and accepted the argument to think of G’d as imperfect, ארורה האדמה, the earth will not continue to put its potential at your disposal without your having to exert yourself by hard labour. Furthermore, also because you rebelled and violated My command,

Verse 18



Verse 19

אל עפר תשוב, you will revert to dust, just as I had told you “on the day you eat from it you will surely become mortal.” (not that he would actually die on that same day).

Verse 20

חוה, she is a necessary requirement for the human species to continue life on earth.
כי היא היתה אם כל חי,  even though the function of the female of the species listed here also applies to all women after Chavah, she is used as the role model and therefore accorded this name. The reason is that she was the first woman ever to fulfill this role.


Verse 21

ויעש ...כתנות עור, without any input by man, similar to a description of the Talmud of what the earth will produce without human input in idyllic times when ready made bread rolls will be produced by the earth (Shabbat 30)
וילבישם, in order that He would not have to expel them from Gan Eden while they were naked. Not only that, but if they would dress themselves in these coats after having been expelled, they might delude themselves that they had improved on G’d’s handiwork.


Verse 22

כאחד ממנו לדעת טוב ורע, he will know good and evil even while continuing to wear “our image.” This would be an intolerable situation, as in spite of his tendency to give in to his evil urge he would live on forever. [the author considers בצלמנו as a reference to the infinite life prevailing among the celestial beings. Ed.] In such circumstances, this Adam whose evil urge was active would continue to chase the material blessings of this world, something which would prevent him from reaching the spiritual aims set for him on earth when G’d made him in the divine image.

Verse 23

וישלחהו, He expelled him. G’d ordered Adam to leave the garden. The expression is used in the same vein as Exodus 12,33 למהר לשלחם מן הארץ, “hastening to send them out of the country.” (Pharaoh)
האדמה אשר לוקח משם, the place to which Adam was transferred was compatible with the requirements of his constitution, more so than other areas on the globe.


Verse 24

ויגרש את האדם, in order to ensure that neither he nor his offspring would return to Gan Eden.
וישכן, G’d placed the cherubs there simultaneously with Adam’s departure. לשמור את דרך עץ החיים, to ensure that on the way out they would not take from its fruit and eat thereof.


Chapter 4



Verse 1



Verse 2

ויהי הבל רועה צאן, Hevel chose this vocation as it required more intelligence and involved one’s mental activities more that farming.
וקין היה עובד אדמה, as a result of each having his own vocation, they each brought different offerings to G’d.

Verse 3



Verse 4

אל הבל ואל מנחתו, seeing that Hevel was pleasing in the eyes of G’d, his gift was also pleasing, seeing that it consisted of the type of product welcome to G’d as an offering.

Verse 5

ואל קין ואל מנחתו לא שעה, He did not turn to Kayin the donor, as he was not pleasing in the eyes of G’d; He also did not turn with favour to his offering seeing the nature of the offering was not designed to make it welcome;
ויחר, due to his jealousy of his brother,
ויפלו פניו, he was downcast, being ashamed, feeling that G’d had publicly shamed him.


Verse 6

למה חרה לך, “why are you jealous of your brother? I did not arbitrarily accept his offering, nor did I do so without justification.
ולמה נפלו פניך, as long as there is a chance to correct what had gone wrong there is no reason to be sad over what is past; one has to try and make amends by doing better in the future.


Verse 7

הלא אם תיטיב, if only you improve yourself you will also be welcome in My eyes.
שאת, every lofty level of greatness is lying in wait for you, ready to become yours,
ואם לא תיטיב לפתח חטאת רובץ, however, sin is also lying in wait for you if you will add further intentional sin to the already performed unintentional sin. This is the way of the evil urge, that once you give into it, it will forever be ready to tempt you again.
כי אליך תשוקתו, “for it longs for you due to its very nature. It too is anxious to satisfy its desires, its aspirations every day.”
ואתה תמשול בו, it is within your power to overcome the power of the evil urge thanks to the צלם אלוקים, the divine image with which you have been provided at birth. This conforms to our sages in Sukkah 52 who have taught that were it not for this צלם אלוקים, which represents G’d’s assistance against the evil urge, there would be no way man could cope with temptation. This is what David meant in Psalms 37,33 ה' לא יעזבנו בידו ולא ירשיענו בהשפטו, “the Lord will not abandon him to his power; He will not let him be condemned in judgment.”


Verse 8

ויאמר קין אל הבל אחיו, how upset he was, and how he had become downcast on account of his brother.
ויהי בהיותם בשדה, away from the presence of their parents.
ויקם קין, Kayin arose without any previous quarrel, similar to Deuteronomy 19,11 וארב לו וקם עליו, “he ambushed him and attacked him.”


Verse 9

אי הבל אחיך, “in which place did you bury him?” G’d phrased this as a question only in order to give Kayin a chance to begin the process of repentance, not because He was not perfectly aware where Kayin had buried Hevel. G’d did not want to be forced to kill someone already guilty of the death penalty.
לא ידעתי, “I do not know.” He thought that the question concerned Hevel’s whereabouts. Seeing that Kayin had not been interested previously in G’d’s ability to know the future, or to become close to Him; such knowledge about G’d was reserved to those who are cleaving to Him.


Verse 10



Verse 11

ארור אתה מן האדמה, cursed and deprived of the good the earth has to offer.
אשר פצתה את פיה, because it allowed itself to be used to  cover up the killing of your brother. As a result, earth will no longer be free to provide the needs of your livelihood in the degree it did up until now. There was no need to spell out the penalty for the murderer. His punishment is part of the principle applying to the penalty for anyone causing willful damage, i.e. he will experience tit for tat as spelled out in Leviticus 24,19.


Verse 12



Verse 13

גדול עוני מנשוא, after Kayin finally realised how G’d in Heaven supervises every detail which goes on down on earth, he was convinced that G’d must know that his sole motivation in doing repentance was to escape punishment. Even this type of repentance was wrung from him only after G’d had pressured him to display penitence. He was embittered, and this is what prompted him to exclaim that the severity of his sin was such there was no hope to obtain forgiveness which would protect him against retribution in kind. The matter is similar to Saul’s failure in killing Agag, King of Amalek. Saul had said to Samuel: “I have sinned,” only after Samuel had insisted that he make a confession of having failed to carry out G’d’s instructions. (Samuel I 15,24) Samuel had had to tell Saul that G’d had despised him as a future leader of the Jewish people before he could prevail on Saul to acknowledge his wrongdoing. (Samuel I 15,24)


Verse 14

והיה כל מוצאי יהרגני, the fact that anyone who finds me is legally entitled to kill me makes my punishment much more severe than You, G’d, have told me.

Verse 15

כל הורג קין שבעתים יוקם, I, G’d, announce that anyone who dares to kill Kayin, [i.e. who takes the law into his own hands, Ed.] would be punished seven more times than what the crime he committed appears to warrant. Anyone who is prepared to kill someone is called הורג, as for instance, in Hoseah 9,13 ואפרים להוציא אל הורג בניו, “Ephrayim too must bring out his children to his slayers.” The word שבעתים means “twice seven times,” as in Proverbs 6,31 ונמצא ישלם שבעתים, “when he is found out he must pay twice sevenfold.” G’d decreed therefore that when someone killed half the human race, or at least a third of the human race, the appropriate vengeance would involve a twice sevenfold penalty. This would manifest itself in such a slayer being a restless wanderer on earth for seven generations. Such a life is considered worse than death. When David prays in Psalms 59,12אל תהרגם פן ישכחו עמי הניעמו בחילך, “do not kill them lest my people will forget them; make them wanderers seeing it is in Your power,” he meant that they be killed only at the end of seven generations. David wanted the punishment of his enemies to last. If they would all die and disappear at once their absence would soon be forgotten. Kayin got his deserts at the end of seven generations as we know from traditional sources in Tanchuma 10.

Verse 24

ולמך שבעים ושבעה. My anguish over what I have done will be many times greater than the anguish of Kayin who had been condemned to be a constant fugitive on the earth. 'כי שבעתים יוקם קין וגו, for if Kayin’s punishment was indeed great, my punishment for having killed my son will be many times greater. [he referred to the anguish he suffered over what he had done, not to the punishment imposed upon him externally, as retribution. Ed.]

Verse 25



Verse 26

'אז הוחל לקרא בשם ה, at that time the righteous people of the earth began to preach monotheism to the public. The meaning is similar to Genesis 21,33 ויקרא שם בשם ה' א-ל עולם, “Avraham proclaimed there the name of the Lord, the Lord of the universe.” The time had come to publicly confront and refute the arguments of the idolaters in that period.

Chapter 5



Verse 1

זה ספר תולדות אדם, thus begins the story of human history, and events worth recording for all posterity.
 בדמות אלוקים עשה אותו, a reference to man’s free will. It is in this respect that man is like G’d. This is why when different generations of man angered G’d they were punished, [i.e. they had not been programmed to do evil. Ed.]

Chapter 6



Verse 1



Verse 2



Verse 3

לא ידון רוחי בארם לעולם בשגם הוא בשר, it is intolerable that there will continue the argument, strife before Me allowing (the angels?) to claim that although seeing that man has been endowed with divine qualities he must be punished, whereas his close ties to physical earth must be considered as excuses for his conduct, entitling him to continued mercy, and indulgence by Me.
והיו ימיו, he will be given a certain length of time within which to repent his sins;
מאה ועשרים שנה, during which time Noach would have time to construct the ark, and by doing so rebuking and warning people of what is in store for them. (compare Sanhedrin 108)


Verse 4

הנפילים היו בארץ בימים ההם, these giants were not about until the last 120 years which G’d had assigned man as a grace period within which to do teshuvah וגם אחר כן, as well as thereafter, i.e. they did not repent and mend their ways at all.


Verse 5

כי רבה רעת האדם,  a reference to the past,
וכל יצר לב האדם, a reference to the future (when it would not improve)


Verse 6

ויתעצב אל לבו, seeing that G’d does not want even the guilty to die instead of finding their way back. The opposite “emotion” of G’d to the one expressed here is found in Psalms 104,31 ישמח ה' במעשיו, “the Lord ‘enjoys’ the deeds of His creatures.”

Verse 7



Verse 8

ונח מצא חן, this is an explanation why also his sons and daughters (in law) were saved. Noach’s personal merits did not entitle him to demand from G’d that He also save them on the strength of his merits. They required special חנינה, clemency  (based on Bereshit Rabbah 29,1. According to the verse in Ezekiel 14,14-19 G’d discusses with the prophet the three men Noach, Daniel, and Job as possessing sufficient merit to be saved themselves, but as not having sufficient merit to entitle their families to be saved [the rider there is if these three men had lived in the (wicked) city described by G’d to Ezekiel, the men of the city would not have been saved by their presence.] The reason why these individuals were not as effective in saving the people around them was that they were devout and pious for themselves without trying to use their influence to convert their contemporaries to adopt their lifestyles. This is what made them basically different from Avraham, Moses and Samuel and others like them, who went out to win converts. This is what the sages in Pessachim 87 had in mind when they described such people. The Talmud distinguishes between people who זכו ללמוד ולא זכו ללמד, “acquired the merit of studying Torah, but did not acquire the merit of disseminating Torah knowledge.” [Rashi in the Talmud contrasts Daniel’s activities in Eylam (the country of which Shushan was the capital) with those of Ezra in Babylon. The former, while learning Torah, did not teach it, the latter both learned and taught with very beneficial results. Ed.] A righteous person who keeps perfecting himself is entitled to being saved personally, but he is not entitled thereby to save others on his account. While Noach did rebuke the men of his time, he did not travel the extra mile to try and convert them to do good. Our sages in Berachot 19 comment that “if you see a Torah scholar who was guilty of something improper during the day, do not accuse him of anything in your mind during the following night for surely he has done teshuvah in the interval.”


Verse 9

תולדות נח, a reference to his history, commencing with his own life and continuing with that of his offspring.
צדיק, in his deeds,
תמים, in his attitudes, בדורותיו, according to the generations during which he lived. They included part of the generation of Metushelach, of Lemech, and those during the 600 years preceding the deluge.
את האלוקים התהלך נח, he walked in G’d’s way trying to be helpful to others, and to instruct and if necessary to rebuke them, as our sages pointed out. This is also in accordance with what the historian Berussi Hacaldaii (3rd century B.C.) wrote about him.


Verse 10

ויולד נח, as soon as he began to rebuke his fellowmen he was granted children

Verse 11



Verse 12

והנה נשחתה, without external influences, as a natural consequence, not due to man’s ecologically criminal behaviour. Although on the surface, there appeared to be no connection, man’s corruption resulted in the corruption of his habitat. The language used here by the Torah is comparable to Isaiah 47,2 וטחני קמח, “and grind meal.”  One does not grind flour, but one grinds grain into flour. The prophet spoke about the end product. The Torah also spoke about the end product of man’s corruption bringing in its wake, though invisibly, the destruction of the earth’s crust.

Verse 13

ויאמר..קץ כל בשר, a reference to the end of the period G’d had allocated to man for his repentance. 
בא לפני, this period has now expired.
כי מלאה הארץ חמס מפניהם, for they all rob each other. The owners rob their leaseholders, the leaseholders rob the owners through deceit, so that in the final analysis all of the earth’s produce is grown for the benefit of robbers.
והנני משחיתם את הארץ, so that now I will destroy them together with the earth. I will destroy the climate which could support life on earth by interfering with the sun’s orbit and rearranging it from the beginning of the deluge for the entire future. We find that G’d explained this to Job In Job 38, 4-15. This accounts for the lifespan of man having been drastically reduced after the deluge. The climate of the earth changed, there were greater extremes of heat and cold, the produce of the earth was considerably less capable of supporting a long lifespan. As a by-product of this deterioration in the quality of the vegetable products, man was allowed to eat meat as a compensation.


Verse 14

'עשה לך תבת וגו, during the period allocated to them, in order to remind them to do teshuvah.

Verse 15



Verse 16

בצדה תשים, on the side which is wide, for that is the side called צד. The long side is referred to as צלע.
תחתיים, the lower deck in ships; as in any other ship, the customary lower deck.
שניים ושלשים, they are similar, parallel to the lower deck.


Verse 17

ואני הנני מביא את המבול, G’d is saying, that Noach’s task is to build the ark, whereas He, when the time expires, will bring on the deluge He had threatened as soon as the ark would be completed. The word מבול is a variant of מפלה, referring to something lost as in Deut. 14,21 כל נבלה, a carcass being a life lost. The definitive article ה in המבול refers to the destruction, the nature of which had not previously been spelled out. [my paraphrasing. Ed.]

Verse 18

This is why the Torah added the words מאדם ועד בהמה, עד רמש ועד עוף השמים וימחו מן הארץ, “man or beast, moving creatures, including the birds of the sky disintegrated completely.” No traceable remains survived.

Verse 24

ויגברו...חמישים ומאת יום. These 150 days are counted from the beginning of the 40 days of rainfall. The level of water on the surface of the earth kept increasing for 150 days, concluding on the 17th of the seventh month (Nissan). On that date the ark came to rest (on the waters) seeing there was no pressure exerted on it from any direction. The pressure on the ark to move was exerted from the first day of the rain when the Torah simultaneously reported the fountains below opening and adding their water to that of the rain. (verse 11). The ark resisted this pressure until the waters on earth were so high that they lifted the ark from its base. When the days of rainfall had concluded, the pressure from the subterranean waters kept up until the end of 150 days. When that pressure ceased the ark finally came to rest on Mount Ararat.

ויאמר ה' אל לבו, what G’d said to Himself at this time He did not reveal to Noach and his sons until they had accepted His commandments and He had established a covenant with them.
כי יצר לב האדם רע , seeing that after the deluge the climatic conditions on the earth became considerably less favourable, people did not develop as much intellectually and at such an early age as prior to the deluge. Before the deluge, the evil urge, and the urge to act wisely and not self-destructively, had been in balance, now the evil urge was active already in their earliest youth and was not balanced by the presence of an active יצר טוב. [This helps us understand why G’d appeared to be more indulgent of human weakness after the deluge instead of the reverse. Ed.]


Verse 22

עוד כל ימי הארץ זרע וקציר, וקור וחום, וקיץ וחורף, ויום ולילה, לא ישבתו; nature will not cease to function dependably as it had prior to the deluge. The sun will orbit predictably, its orbit will be subject to calculation in advance, so will be its position relative to other phenomena in the sky. All the time periods mentioned in this verse will somehow be related to the position of the sun at different times during the year. It would be different from before the deluge. Whereas prior to the deluge the sun had remained at a fixed distance relative to the earth all year round, its orbit being circular, resulting in eternal spring in the populated parts of the earth, now there would be all these changes, though at predetermined intervals, resulting in alternating seasons of relative warmth and cold due to the elliptical nature of the sun’s orbit [Although the author lived approximately at the time of Copernicus having determined that the earth moves around the sun instead of being the center of our galaxy, the basic concept even according to the ancient world view does not invalidate the author’s description of antediluvian and postdiluvian climatic conditions. Ed.. כל ימי הארץ, until such time as G’d would correct this deterioration in living conditions on earth due to the effect of the deluge. This “correction” is what the prophet Isaiah 66,22 had in mind when he spoke of the הארץ החדשה אשר אני עושה, “the new earth which I am going to make.” In that future foreseen by the prophet, the sun will once more orbit like a circle instead of like an ellipsis, a configuration responsible for the uneven temperatures on earth during different parts of the year. At that time, the whole vegetation on earth will undergo an upgrading, the curse earth experienced both after Adam’s sin and after Kayin’s murder of his brother Hevel being lifted. Conditions of length of human life will revert to what they had been before the deluge, as the prophet said that a נער, a youth, if he dies at a hundred years old will be considered as having died in his adolescence and more verses there describing this future. This is also what David referred to in Psalms 65,9 מוצאי בוקר וערב תרנין, “You make the lands of sunrise and sunset shout for joy.”

Verse 4

אך בשר בנפשו, but the flesh of living animals, while its life-force is still inside it,
 i.e. this life-force is equivalent to its blood; you must neither eat its flesh nor its blood,
לא תאכלו, only in that state must you not eat it; once the blood has left the body, gentiles are allowed to eat blood.


Verse 5

ואך את דמכם לנפשותיכם אדרוש, although I will not punish you for spilling animal’s blood, I will hold you responsible for shedding the blood of fellow human beings. Human beings, all human beings, are more precious to Me than the lives of animals. This retribution for spilling the blood of human beings may on different occasions be applied in different ways: It all depends on the worthiness of the person under attack or potential attack. If, for instance, the person deserves saving, the words מיד כל חיה אדרשנו ומיד אדם are meant in the preventive sense, i.e. G’d will save such a person’s life be it under attack from animals or from human beings. If, in the eyes of G’d, the person under attack does not deserve being saved from violent death, this still did not give the animals or other human beings the right to kill him. Therefore, in such instances, ipso facto, G’d will exact retribution from the killers. 
This is the meaning of the apparently redundant words מיד איש אחיו אדרוש את נפש האדם, where the word אדרוש refers to the life of a human being that has already been killed. We find the word אדרוש in both senses depending on circumstances, compare Ezekiel 34,10. The emphasis on איש את אחיו, refers to G’d exacting such retribution from humans for killing humans, seeing that this is not their nature, or should not be their nature. He will not exact retribution from an animal which killed a human being who, in G’d’s eyes, had already forfeited its right to live.

Verse 6

באדם דמו ישפך, a reference to a human tribunal.
כי בצלם אלוקים, this is the reason why G’d exacts retribution for killing human beings, whereas He does not exact retribution from man for killing animals, [even though killing, say for sport is prohibited. Ed.] The animals have not been created in the image of G’d, so that their death does not deprive the earth of a divine image. Only human beings are described in the Torah, on occasion, also as אלוהים, as for instance in Exodus 22,8. <br> את האדם, from the moment G’d had said (Genesis 1,26) נעשה אדם, “let us make a human being,” He had endowed His creatures with an independent intelligence, able to defy Him either collectively or individually. It is this “divine attribute” of man that makes him sufficiently important for his Creator to demand an accounting from those who destroy that divine image by killing a human being.


Verse 7

ואתם פרו ורבו, not only must you not diminish the human population on earth, but you are commanded to increase it by being fruitful and by multiplying.

Verse 8



Verse 9

ואני הנני מקים את בריתי, this promise is conditional on man keeping his part of the bargain, bringing murderers to justice. If, however, innocent blood will be shed in the manner it had been before the deluge, this may lead to destruction of the earth (not necessarily by water). This is what is meant in Numbers 35,33 הדם הוא יחניף את הארץ ולארץ לא יכופר לדם אשר שפך בה כי אם בדם שפכו  “for blood turns the earth into a hypocrite and there will be no atonement for the land except through the blood of him who has spilled it.” 

Verse 10



Verse 11

ולא יהיה עוד מבול לשחת הארץ, there will not ever again be the kind of catastrophe which will destroy the whole surface of the earth at the same time.

Verse 12



Verse 13

את קשתי נתתי בענן, I have arranged that the rainbow become a natural phenomenon.
והיתה לאות ברית, there is a dual function to the rainbow; it is true that the scientists have already tired of trying to explain the phenomenon of the various colours of the second rainbow, something which appears in the opposite order of the colours in the original rainbow, [according to the encyclopedia Britannica, there are primary and secondary rainbows, the secondary rainbow having a colour pattern in a reverse order of that known as the primary rainbow. Our author may understand that which has baffled scientists in his time, as a hint of the dual nature of the rainbow, i.e. as a warning, or a promise respectively. Ed.] According to the view of the sages in Ketuvot 77 the very appearance of the rainbow is a reminder that the generation in which it appears is a guilty generation. It is reported there that two generations were fortunate enough that in their time no rainbow was ever observed. This was interpreted as a sign that the people of that generation did not need the phenomenon of the rainbow to alert them to become penitents. Their religious leaders did an outstanding job in prevailing on the people to be Torah-observant. [according to the של'ה, it is not reasonable to assume that there were periods when the laws of nature were suspended and there was no rainbow; rather if the Jewish people during certain periods were very deserving, had lots of merits, so that they did not need to be reminded of the deluge, the rain descended at night when no rainbow would become visible even if they had not been a deserving generation. Ed.]


Verse 14

בענני ענן, a reminder that the rainbow will not be visible unless there are dark clouds in the sky after the atmosphere had been very moist.

Verse 15



Verse 16

וראיתיה לזכור ברית עולם, I will take a close look at how the righteous of that time call the ordinary people to order, and whether their prayers are on behalf of their contemporaries. If they make their weight felt, I, in turn, will remember My covenant in their favour, and My wrath at them will be turned aside.

Verse 17

ויאמר אלוקים לנח זאת אות הברית, the word זאת refers to the “secondary” rainbow, [I mentioned earlier. Ed.] which acts as the sign of the warning aspect of the covenant. When this rainbow appears it is high time to call people to order and to warn them of impending natural calamities unless they change their ways.

Verse 18

וחם הוא אבי כנען, he was similar in his conduct to his son Canaan, who was famous as being evil. Such descriptions implying “like father like son,” are also found, for instance in Ezekiel 16,3 אביך האמורי, “your father the Emorite,” (meaning that the prophet chides Israel for its actions saying these could make one think that Israel’s ancestor had been the Emorite,” (one of the Canaanite tribes).

Verse 19

שלשה אלה בני נח, seeing that all of them were Noach’s sons, G’d blessed them all, even though one of them was wicked, when He said “be fruitful and multiply and fill the globe.” As a result of this blessing, באלה נפצה כל הארץ, the entire population of the earth traces its origin to one of these three sons of Noach.


Verse 20

ויחל נח, he profaned himself, began to engage in unseemly activities. As a consequence, some of the results were negative. Our story illustrates how a seemingly minor deviation from accepted norms will ultimately result in major deviations from acceptable conduct. A case in point is found in Numbers 25,1 where the Israelites began by indulging in sexual permissiveness with the daughters of Moav, only to end up in worshipping their deities, and 24,000 Israelites being killed by a plague sent by G’d. Interestingly, that chapter also began with the word ויחל, (profaning oneself).

Verse 21



Verse 22

וירא חם אבי כנען את ערות אביו, he saw the shameful deed his son כנען had done to his father Noach when he had castrated him. (according to some of our sages in Sanhedrin 70) According to the historian Berussi Hacaldaii, (compare Genesis 6,9) Canaan castrated his grandfather not surgically, but by some means of sorcery. His father Cham watched his son invoke the witchcraft without protesting or trying to stop him. Disgrace, shame, is also called ערוה, “nakedness.” Compare Ezra 4,14 וערות מלכא לא אריך לנא למחזא “it is not right that we should see the king being disgraced.” Also, in Deuteronomy 21,4 the expression ערות דבר does not refer to either literal nakedness, or to sexual licentiousness, or incest, but refers to “a disgraceful thing.”
ויגד לשני אחיו בחוץ, he revealed that he had enjoyed what his son had done. 


Verse 23

ופניהם אחורנית, even when only covering their father they walked with their faces averting their eyes from him. It would have caused them additional grief to behold their father in such a state.

Verse 24



Verse 25

עבד עבדים יהיה לאחיו, his being in a position of dependence to his senior brothers, i.e. a plain עבד, was merely natural, and would not have been a special curse, especially in view of his disgraceful conduct. Solomon  paraphrased this in Proverbs 11,29 when he spoke about ועבד אויל לחכם לב, that “a fool is a slave to the wise-hearted.”

Verse 26

ויהי כנען, his offspring [seeing that the word ויהי is in the future tense; Ed.] 
עבד למו, to the G’d as well as to the offspring of Shem. The formulation is parallel to Joshua 9,27 where the Gibeonites are condemned to be “hewers of wood and carriers of water” for the Israelites (having duped them into thinking that they were not Canaanites)


Verse 27

באהלי שם, (the plural mode) is a reference to Torah academies in addition to the Temple.
עבד למו, both to Yaphet and to Shem, even at times when the Temple will not stand.

Verse 6

ופוט וכנען, the sons of Put are not mentioned separately, as they all formed a single nation retaining the name of their founding father. Proof of this is found in Ezekiel 38,5 פרס, כוש, ופוט אתם, i.e. even in the days of the pre-messianic wars of Gog and Magog, Put will still have its original name.

Verse 7

ובני כוש סבא וחוילה, each one of these sons became a nation in its own right. This was in addition to those of his sons who continued to bear their founding father’s name. (compare Isaiah 43,3)

Verse 8

וכוש ילד את נמרד, among all the others who were called by their father’s name “Kushites,” there was one special individual who rose to become a world renowned hero, warrior, king.

Verse 9

'לפני ה, this does not mean that he was on the same wavelength as G’d; on the contrary, such expressions are used when someone equates himself and his illusion of power with that of G’d. Compare Jonah 3,3 עיר גדולה לאלוהים, “a great city, G’d-like.” [they were G’d-like in their arrogance. Ed.]

Verse 10

ותהי ראשית ממלכתו בבל, the Torah mentions this to explain that because of Nimrod’s powerful and relatively civilised kingdom all the people moved to the valley of Shinor to be within the orbit of his power and influence. The illusion of great power, augmented by unity of purpose, led to their insurrection against G’d, and to their downfall. Central symbols always exercised a gravitational pull on people’s minds, as we see even among the Jewish people in the efforts by Jerobam to counteract the centrality of the Temple in Jerusalem. (Kings I 12,26)

Verse 11

מן הארץ ההיא יצא אשור, he emigrated from there because he disagreed with Nimrod politically, i.e. he opposed the building of the Tower (fearing that G’d would punish the people including his children who were associating themselves with rebellious project)
ויבן את נינוה, because he had distanced himself from the plans undertaken by the four countries under the rule of Nimrod in the land of Shinor, G’d rewarded him to let him build the four cities mentioned here. This is an instance of אל פניו ישלם לו, of G’d recompensing someone for a good deed “to his face,” i.e. so that he can realise that this is what G’d has done for him. (Deuteronomy 7,10)

Verse 21

ולשם יולד, the formulation suggests that the son born to Shem resembled his father in his good qualities, the son in question being עבר. 
גם הוא אבי כל בני עבר, although, as we know from the description of Avraham as an עברי, a Hebrew, (a descendant of Ever) i.e. as someone believing in G’d the Creator being the sole G’d, and it might appear that Ever initiated this adherence to monotheism in his time, Shem, the father too, was a founder of preaching monotheism in his time. Anyone teaching and instructing others, especially in a way of life and philosophy, is called אבי, “father of.” We have come across this term as possessing such meaning already in Genesis 4,21 when Yuval was introduced as the inventor and teacher of how to play musical instruments featuring strings. Just as the teachers, mentors are called “fathers,” so the disciples are called “sons,” בנים, as in Samuel I 10,12 בני הנביאים, “the disciples of the prophets.”


Verse 22



Verse 23



Verse 24



Verse 25

פלג..כי בימיו נפלגה הארץ, this verse informs us of the moral stature of Ever who was able to foresee by means of holy spirit what the future held in store during the lifetime of his son. He called his son Peleg in order to allude to the fact that commencing with his son, man’s life on earth would be drastically shorter. In fact, it was due to the sin committed when his generation built the Tower, that G’d punished them by making them physically weaker so that they aged much more rapidly. The collapse of the Tower was also accompanied by a change in the earth’s climate. (may be not so much the earth’s climate, but the adjustment necessary for the bodies of the people emigrating to regions on earth which had a climate different from that in Mesopotamia)

Chapter 11



Verse 1



Verse 2

בנסעם מקדם, they were leading the lives of nomads, much like shepherds who move to wherever there was good grazing land for their flocks.

Verse 3

הבה נלבנה לבנים, now they wanted to build permanent housing for themselves and pens for the flocks and herds. This was a common consensus, as we know from the Torah describing their speaking to each other as ויאמרו איש אלך רעהו, “they said each to his colleague.”

Verse 4

ויאמרו הבה נבנה לנו עיר, this was at the advice of their leaders who wanted to enthrone Nimrod as king over the entire human race,
ומגדל וראשו בשמים ונעשה לנו שם, the meaning of the words נעשה שם, is a metaphor for “let us make a supreme idol.” This idol was to be placed on top of the Tower. They hoped that the visibility of the Tower and its symbol on top would ensure that they would be most highly esteemed among people all over the world, regardless of whether such people had become part of their city-state. Anyone ruling their city, would automatically be recognised as the ruler of mankind.


Verse 5

וירד ה' לראות, The Torah uses the expression “G’d descended to see, etc.,” only when the sins committed by the people concerned were not yet ripe for severe punishment but would become so if left unchecked. Retribution which results from G’d “descending,” must be viewed as a kind of preventive medicine, designed to avoid the need for more drastic action at a later stage. One well known example of G’d’s preventive retribution is the בן סורר ומורה, a thirteen year old who stole a little meat and wine from his parents, and whose punishment is execution if the parents brought him to court as an unmanageable teenager (Deut. 21,18, see Rashi, and Sanhedrin 72 on this). In the case of Sodom, where G’d is also reported as “descending,” (Genesis 18,21) this also occurred at a time when their sin had not yet been greater than that of other surrounding nations, so that only these cities had to be singled out for punishment at that time. What distinguished the Sodomites was only the cruelty with which they committed the same kind of sins as those committed by other nations. This would eventually have led to such a corrupt world that the need for G’d to intervene on a global rather than a local basis, would have become unavoidable. Ezekiel 16,49 also describes the sin of the Sodomites in such terms when he wrote הנה זה היה עון סדום אחותך...ויד עני ואביון לא החזיקה”This was the sin of Sodom your sister…..but the hand of the poor and the needy she did not support.” Similarly, the punishment of the Israelites when they were exiled was brought forward out of concern that something worse might become their fate if G’d did not intervene at that time and exile them so that He would not eventually have to punish them even more harshly. (Deut 32,20) “I can see what would be their ultimate end.” 


Verse 6

הן עם אחד, the only way I can stop them from carrying out their unanimously approved plan is to sow the seeds of discord between them. The instrument of bringing this about is to confuse their language. Basically, people’s disagreements are either religious, (philosophical) in nature, or they result from misunderstanding what they mean when they speak. These people had been of one mind in matters of religion, seeing that they had all agreed with the mistaken idolatrous philosophy shared by mankind at that time. In spite of such apparently good reasons for disagreeing with one another, they did not misunderstand each other.
וזה החלו לעשות, and yet they all agree to begin this project. 
ועתה לא יבצר מהם, in view of these circumstances, if left alone, they would complete what they have set out to do, so that this form of idolatry they have agreed on would henceforth be something embraced by all of mankind. Not a single one of them would turn to the Creator of the universe and realise that He, and He alone, is the Creator of the entire universe. On the other hand, the opposite will occur if discord will break out among them regarding the supremacy of any of the deities versus the competing ones. In such a scenario, every nation would believe that there is one deity that is superior to all the various national deities, whose concern is only with the particular nation worshipping that deity. All the minor deities would have to subordinate themselves to the power of that super-deity. The prophet Maleachi 1,11 expresses this in the following words: ”for from where the sun rises to where it sets, My name is honoured among the nations;” כי ממזרח שמש ועד מבואו גדול שמי בגוים. 


Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11

ויולד בנים ובנות, the Torah does not mention even once the word וימות, “he died,” something that appears with the report of each of the generations preceding the deluge. The reason why the Torah mentioned the death of those generations was because each of them died before the main subject of the entire chapter had been reached, i.e. the destruction of life on earth by the deluge. The people in the generations from Noach onward are considered as having been forerunners fo a positive development, as opposed to their predecessors who simply died before everybody else died also. In our chapter the thrust of the story is to show that eventually a towering personality such as Avraham emerged on earth, so that those who preceded him may be viewed as paving the way for Avraham’s eventual emergence on the stage of history. Avraham’s greatness is enhanced by the relatively insignificant lives of his predecessors.

Verse 31

ללכת ארצה כנען, this land is prepared for enabling its residents to acquire all intellectual advantages, and, as far as G’d is concerned, it is the most preferred of all the countries on earth. We have this on the authority of the Torah itself which says of that land (Deuteronomy 11,12) ארץ אשר ה' אלוקיך דורש אותה תמיד עיני ה' אלוקיך בה מרשית השנה ועד אחרית שנה, “and concerning which G’d enquires constantly, His eyes being trained on it from the beginning of the year until the year’s end.” The climate of the land of Canaan had not been negatively affected by the rains of the deluge, as had the climate of all other parts of the globe. We have this on the authority of Ezekiel 22,24 ארץ לא גשמה ביום זעם, “a land which did not experience rain on the day of the fury.” This may well be the reason why the sages (Baba Batra 58) said that the climate of the land of Israel makes people smarter.

Verse 32

וימת תרח בחרן, he had not made an effort to realise his intention of moving all the way to the land of Canaan as he had set out to do in verse 31. He never even visited his son Avraham in the land of Canaan, never observing with his own eyes what a great name Avraham had made for himself and G’d there. Lot, on the other hand, did the opposite for a while at least, having joined Avraham, kept him company and this is why both he and his offspring benefited from this both immediately, such as when Lot became rich in Egypt, as well as much later when Israel was not allowed to conquer the lands belonging to Lot’s descendants, i.e. Ammon and Moav. (compare Nachmanides on Pinchas 25,18)

Chapter 12



Verse 1

אל הארץ אשר אראך, to the specific area within the country which I will show you in a heavenly vision. This is why Avram kept moving further into the land without pitching his tent to settle down until he received the appropriate sign from G’d. This occurred when he reached Shechem, where we are told that G’d appeared to him (verse 7)

Verse 2

והיה ברכה, a true blessing by G’d is when G’d rejoices in our deeds and actions. Our sages (Berachot 7) illustrate this when they quote a conversation between the High Priest Rabbi Yishmael ben Elisha who, while offering incense on Yom Kippur, had a vision of the angel Katriel sitting on the throne of G’d. The latter said to him: “Yishmael, My son, bless Me.” He said to him: (in the words attributed as being G’d’s own ‘prayer’) “may it be Your will that Your mercy will subdue Your anger and may Your mercy exile Your justified attribute to punish Your people for their sins, and may Your mercy prevail so that You deal with Your children by applying the attribute of Mercy.” When G’d’s representative, the angel Katriel heard this, he touched the High Priest on the head, which the latter took as a sign that the blessing uttered by an inferior creature for a superior should not be dismissed as worthless.” [I have stuck more closely to the text of the Talmud than did the author here. Ed.] G’d here blessed Avram, with becoming the one who would preach monotheism including awareness of the benevolence of G’d which He extends to all of His creatures.

Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5

ויצאו ללכת ארצה כנען, a land of which they had heard that it was singularly suited for people of their religious beliefs, a land in which the true G’d could be worshipped without hindrance.
ויבאו ארצה כנען, as opposed to Terach, who had also set out originally to go to the land of Canaan but had stopped at Charan, these people with Avram at their head made good on their intention.


Verse 6

ויעבר אברם בארץ, Avram did not stop anywhere in his journey south through the land of Canaan until G’d appeared to him as He had said: “to the land which I will show you.” (verse 1).


Verse 7



Verse 8

בית אל מים והעי מקדם, between two large cities, in order to attract large crowds who could hear him preach.

Verse 9

הלוך ונסוע הנגבה, when he journeyed, as is the custom of shepherds, he did not move to the east and to the west alternately, but kept moving in a southerly direction. He did this in order not to deviate from moving between one of the two towns he had been between when he first stopped between Bet El and Ai. Members of those cities had begun to trail him planning to join him.

Verse 10

לגור שם, not to settle there permanently.

Verse 11

כאשר הקריב, close to the time when it became necessary to take such precautions, so that he would not forget.
לבא מצרימה, a country which was equivalent to a giant brothel. This is mentioned even more forcefully in Ezekiel 23,20 where the prophet describes the carnal attitudes of the Egyptians as אשר בשר חמורים בשרם, וזרמת סוסים זרמתם, “those whose flesh is the flesh of donkeys, and whose sperm is the sperm of horses.” 


Verse 12

והרגו אותי, because they do not expect me to agree to give you to them.

Verse 13

למען ייטב לי, so that when you will say that you are my sister, each one will entertain the hope that I will agree to your marrying them. Therefore, none of them will have any reason to kill me. Rather, he will seek my approval by offering me a dowry for you. It was the custom in those days that the father of the bride would be bribed with money or its equivalent to agree to let his daughter marry someone. This also explains why the Torah speaks of מהר ימהרנה in Exodus 22,15-16, i.e. “he (the seducer) shall pay a heavy dowry,” and why the option to refuse such a marriage is not so much the girl’s but her father’s, as we see from the verse following.

Verse 14

ויראו המצרים, all of them, when looking at Sarai, entertained the very thoughts Avraham had anticipated.

Verse 15

ויראו אותה שרי פרעה, they quickly quashed any hopes the commoners had entertained relating to marrying this woman.

Verse 16

ותקח האשה ולאברם היטיב, the members of Pharaoh’s household did not even waste time to seduce Sarai but abducted her forcefully. They thought that seeing that it was a compliment for Sarai to be desired by the king himself, she would automatically consent to such an elevation of her status. Seeing that she had described herself only as Avram’s sister and not his wife, they had no reason to believe that there was a legal obstacle to such a union. Pharaoh himself said “I took her as a wife for myself,” not a concubine, not a mistress. In verse 19 he explains that he had taken Sarai as a wife, feeling certain that she was not legally linked to any other man.

Verse 17

וינגע ה' את פרעה נגעים גדולים, only Pharaoh was struck with “great” afflictions, 
whereas his household suffered lesser afflictions. This was arranged by G’d so that the Egyptians, when they saw that only Sarai had remained completely immune to these afflictions, would conclude that the afflictions were on account of her and her fate.

Verse 18

למה לא הגדת לי, even if you had reason to suspect the ordinary citizens would harm you on account of her, surely you could have told me, the king, the truth, seeing that it is my task to rule with justice.

Verse 19

?למה אמרת אחותי היא, even after she had already been brought to my palace?
ואקח אותה לי לאשה, so that I took her to be my wife, not my concubine. I though that seeing that she is your sister you would surely approve of this union!

Verse 2

ואברם כבד מאד במקנה, this is why he had to travel slowly, even though he wanted to return quickly to the site of the altar where he wanted to continue his preaching as he had done before the famine.

Verse 3

וילך למסעיו, this is why he traveled on his routes, i.e. the routes all the shepherds took when journeying in that direction.

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6

ולא נשא אותם הארץ, the grazing land available in that region was inadequate for their combined herds.

Verse 7

ויהי ריב בין רועי מקנה אברם ובין רועי מקנה לוט, there was an argument between who would succeed to drive out the other from the available grazing land they would find.
והכנעני והפריזי אז יושב בארץ. This is why a quarrel between two brothers who lived side by side was especially embarrassing and harmful to the image of Avram among the surrounding tribes. When those tribes would see the brothers quarrel, they would assume that neither of them was a peace-loving individual and they would reason that they had even more reason to quarrel with either one of those recent immigrants.


Verse 8

ביני ובינך, in the future. When either one of them would select for his herds a certain grazing area.
אל נא תהי מריבה, the result of competing aspirations to the same grazing land.
ובין רועי ובין רועיך, now that we dwell here.


Verse 9

הלא כל הארץ לפניך, I’ll let you choose the area which you prefer. 
Therefore, הפרד נא מעלי, move away from me in the direction you prefer and I will move in the opposite direction. If you select grazing land to the left, I will select grazing land to the right.

Verse 10



Verse 11

ויבחר לו לוט, he selected as much area as he himself with his shepherds would manage to control as their grazing land. In this section of the earth Avram and his shepherds would not be allowed to graze. 
ויסע לוט מקדם, he did not turn right or left which were north and south, but he moved from the east to the west to distance himself from Avram [the author translated מקדם as meaning “from the east,” though this is difficult to reconcile with the fact that the Jordan valley is east from the region of Bet El and Ai where Avram and Lot had been reported last in verse 3. The area of the Jordan valley was the area from which the Israelites under the leadership of Joshua would enter the land of Canaan (Joshua chapter 4)


Verse 12

אברם ישב בארץ כנען, even though the city of Sodom and its satellite towns are on the border of the land of Canaan, the people living in those cities at that time, were not Canaanites. It was therefore in order for the Torah to write that Avram- as opposed to Lot- settled in the land of Canaan. He settled in the part of the land inhabited by Canaanites. They were not as evil as the Sodomites. Avram did not move close to the boundary of Sodom at all.

Verse 13



Verse 14

אחרי הפרד לוט, G’d did not say what follows while Lot was still in Avram’s company, so that the latter would not boast and his shepherds would engage in stealing grazing land from the local inhabitants claiming G’d’s promise to Avram of future possession as their justification.

לך אתננה, for even in your own lifetime you will be regarded as a prince of G’d, and deserving of great honour (compare Genesis 23,6)

Verse 18

ויאהל אברם, an expression denoting the encamping, erecting one’s many tents.

Chapter 14



Verse 1

ויהי בימי אמרפל מלך שנער, who was widely known as a powerful king in his generation and also later. During his lifetime the kings listed forthwith, i.e. Aryoch, king of Elassar, Kedorlaomer, king of Eylam, and Tidal, king of Goyim, jointly made war against Bera, etc.

Verse 2



Verse 3

כל אלה, all the ones just named, Amrafel and the two groups that conducted the war.
חברו אל עמק השדים, gathered in that valley and arrived at a compromise concerning the dispute between them. From that time on, the five kings and their subjects served Kedorlaomer, paying him taxes for 12 years, after which they rebelled.


Verse 4

עבדו את כדרלעמר, after the compromise they had reached 12 years ago. Afterwards, they rebelled.

Verse 5

והמלכים אשר אתו, the ones who had been signatories to the compromise deal 12 years previously, amongst whom had also been Amrafel.
ויכו את הרפאים...ואת הזוזים...ואת האימים, all of these people had been subservient to the group of 5 kings headed by the king of Sodom, and had even fought wars on behalf of their masters. By telling us all this, the Torah wanted us to know that the five kings were not just paper tigers, pushovers. By inference, it enables us to imagine the military power of the four kings who defeated the five kings afterwards. Having once appreciated all this, we can image what a tremendous feat Avram accomplished when he defeated the four kings under the leadership of Kedorleomer. He must have possessed outstanding military skills in order to have accomplished this. It also testifies to the act of selfless love he displayed for his nephew, when he endangered himself and his men to such a degree in order to free him from captivity. Most of all, it gives us a chance to marvel at the mercy G’d showed both to Lot and to Avram in this sequence of events.

Verse 9



Verse 10

וינוסו מלך סדום, this made it plain that Avram could not rely on them that they would help him.
והנשארים הרה נסו, the remaining three kings. 


Verse 11



Verse 12

ויקחו את לוט בן אחי אברם, they made a special effort to capture Lot because he was Avram’s nephew. They were aware of his wealth. They were expecting that Avram would pay a heavy ransom for the release of his nephew.

Verse 13

ויגד לאברם העברי, this refugee had no idea that Lot was related to Avram. He only knew that Lot’s religious beliefs were similar to those of Avram.
והוא שוכן באלוני ממרא, this is why Aner, Eshkol, and Mamre participated in the war with Avram, and why he insisted in verse 24 that they receive their share of the loot.


Verse 14

 וירדוף עד רן, in his pursuit to attack them suddenly.

Verse 15

ויחלק עליהם לילה, he divided his forces all around them to make them believe that they were being attacked by large forces from several fronts. We have been told about a similar situation in Kings II 7,6 when the Aramites fled headlong after hearing noises that convinced them that they were being attacked by large forces.
לילה, this was also part of the subterfuge, preventing the kings from realising that they were facing insignificant numbers of opponents. In Samuel II 17,1 this was the advice to Avshalom by Achitofel when he advised to pursue David at night.
ויכם, the defeat caused them to flee.
 וירדפם, the beginning of all pursuits is putting people to flight.


Verse 16

וגם את הנשים, he liberated Lot’s wives, as well as 
העם, all the ordinary people of Sodom who had been taken captive. It was these whom the King of Sodom asked to be restored to him, when he “graciously” (verse 21) offered that Avram could keep the chattels.


Verse 17



Verse 18

הוציא לחם ויין, to all those returning from battle who were tired.
והוא כהן, it was appropriate therefore that he should intone blessings.


Verse 19

ויברכהו ויאמר ברוך אברם לאל עליון, first he blessed on his own behalf. Then he added that Avram was also blessed by the Supreme G’d. He said basically the same as G’d Himself had said to Avram in 12,2.
קונה שמים וארץ, heaven and earth are His, to do with as He pleases. They do not have a will of their own as some scientists believe. G’d alone works His will on them, using them according to His will.


Verse 20

וברוך אל עליון, this power G’d gave to Avram to enable him to overcome his enemies, is a blessing for the Lord. He is able to rejoice in the deeds of His creatures when the wicked perish, and when He makes the righteous rejoice in their success. David expressed it in these words in Psalms 117,1-2 שבחוהו כל האומים גי גבר עלינו חסדו, “Praise the Lord all you nations. Extol Him, all you peoples; for great is His steadfast love toward us;”

Verse 21



Verse 22



Verse 23

אם מחוט ועד שרוך נעל, every time the word אם occurs in Scripture and is not followed by a verb making it a conditional statement, it is used instead of the word שלא, “so that not.” Avram’s statement here means: “I have sworn an oath not to give you even a shoelace or a length of thread as I do not own any of these things. Conversely, I will also not take (accept) anything that is (was) yours.” G’d said something similar to the Jewish people after the debacle of the spies in Numbers 14,23) when He said אם יראו את הארץ, which is a way of saying that they will most certainly not get to see the land (of Israel). In verse 30 in the same chapter the words אם אתם תבאו also mean “you will certainly not come.” Similarly, Samuel I 15,6 חי ה' אם יומת, means “an oath to G’d that he will not be executed, etc.” Also, in Kings II 5,16 חי ה' אשר עמדתי לפניו אם אקח וגו', means: “As the Lord lives whom I serve, I will not accept anything.” There are many similar examples.

Verse 24

בלעדי , “you have said: give me the people, and keep the loot,” I have no intention of taking anything, as I am not even exercising control over any of it.”
רק אשר אכלו הנערים וחלק האנשים, this alone is what they will take from the spoils of war which used to be yours. Avram, who had to supply provisions for his soldiers out of his own pocket, etc., said: I will use only what is needed to reimburse myself as well as the men with me.
אבל ענר אשכול וממרא הם יקחו חלקם, I will neither give them a share, nor will I accept a share on their behalf, but they will themselves take the share they are entitled to.


Chapter 15



Verse 1

אל תירא אברם, do not worry that the four kings will avenge themselves on you.
שכרך, not only that, but your reward over and beyond that is so great that your merits have not decreased on account of your success in that battle. You deserve much more reward for having gone to the assistance of your brother, displaying a supreme degree of love for him and for those belonging to him. You have liberated the victims of kidnappers.
הרבה מאד, both in this world
 and in the world to come. We have been taught, and recite daily in our prayers, that there are things for which one receives some dividends in this world, whereas the principal comes due in the hereafter. One of the good deeds which qualify for such reward is known as גמילות חסדים, the performing of deeds of loving kindness involving not only one’s checkbook but one’s very body (Peah, 1,1).


Verse 2

?מה תתן לי, a reference to the reward in this life.
ערירי, “I have no son who can take my place.” Compare Jeremiah 22,30 כתבו את האיש הזה ערירי כי לא יצלח מזרעו איש יושב על כסא דוד, “record this man as without succession; one who shall never be found successful, for none of his offspring will be accepted to sit on the throne of David.” (the subject of this curse is כניהו son and heir of Yehoyakim) 
ובן משק ביתי הוא דמשק אליעזר, he is only a slave, known only in his home town. There can be no question but that similar actions performed by a slave who is in constant fear of his master’s disapproval, even if in fact the same as those performed by the master’s son, are different in quality, and in effect from one another. The same chores performed by the son are motivated by love instead of by fear.

Verse 3

בן ביתי יורש אותי, even though, in the end, You will give me biological offspring, as You have said in 12,7 לזרעך אתן את הארץ הזאת, “I will give this land to your descendants,” such children will only be minors at the time, so that my servant Eliezer will have to raise them and guide them, in effect being my heir.

Verse 4

לא יירשך זה כי אם אשר יצא ממעיך, for the son would succeed taking over Avram’s leadership role amongst large number of followers while his father was still alive. This is the true meaning of Genesis 25, 5-6 ויתן אברהם את כל אשר לו ליצחק בנו.... בעודנו חי,” Avraham handed over all that was his to his son Yitzchok while he was still alive.” This is followed by the statement that Avraham sent away the sons of the concubines from the presence of his son Yitzchok.

Verse 5



Verse 6

'והאמין בה, he had full confidence that G’d would carry out all that He had promised, even though to an unprejudiced observer, the matter looked extremely unlikely and unnatural.
ויחשבה לו צדקה, G’d credited Avram with having performed an act of faith which deserved to be described as an act of righteousness. This verse was written primarily in order to prevent us from considering Avram’s query במה אדע כי אירשנה, as an expression of doubt in G’d’s promise to him. (verse 8) If Avram had retracted even in the slightest from his firm trust in G’d’s promise, what would have been the point in the Torah explicitly telling us that G’d rated his trust as so praiseworthy? Ezekiel, dealing with such fickle faith in G’d, asks ובשוב צדיק מצדקתו ויעשה עול...כל צדקותיו אשר עשה לא תזכרנה “if a righteous person were to renege from his righteousness and commit evil, none of the righteous deeds he had ever performed would be worth mentioning.” (Ezekiel 18,24)

Verse 7

אשר הוצאתיך מאור כשדים לתת לך את הארץ הזאת, for you, personally, will acquire this land by an act of taking symbolic possession of it. 
לרשתה, so that the children (descendants) would inherit it from you under the heading of an inheritance, i.e. without any interruption in this land being owned by Israelites.


Verse 8

במה אדע, for possibly my descendants will sin and forfeit their claim to this land.

Verse 9

קחה לי עגלה, take a heifer for Me, in order to enter into a covenant concerning this assurance. Converting G’d’s promise into what is known as a “covenant,” is equivalent to G’d reinforcing His promise by an oath, something which is unconditional and irrevocable. (Rosh Hashanah 18) Moses himself confirmed this interpretation when he said (Deut 9,5)  “not due to your righteousness or the uprightness of your heart, but due to the wickedness of these nations does G’d dispossess them on your account; and in order to keep His promise which He had sworn to your forefathers Avraham, Yitzchok and Yaakov 

Verse 10

Verse 12



Verse 13

ידוע תדע, here G'd informed Avram why it would take such a long time before His promise to Avraham that his descendants would inherit the land of Canaan could be fulfilled. G'd would not be justified in expelling a nation from its homeland until its measure of sin is full to overflowing. Therefore G'd told Avram ידוע תדע כי גר יהיה זרעך בארץ לא להם, that his own descendants would be strangers in a land which is not theirs until such time as the local inhabitants could legally be expelled by G'd from the land of Canaan. At the same time, He also told him about what would happen to his descendants in the interval, i.e. enslavement, cruel oppression, etc., for at least some of the intervening years. However, G'd implied that such suffering would not occur during the periods when Avram's descendants would be righteous. We know from the dates when the sons of Yaakov died, that as long as even a single one of them survived, no restrictions of any kind were imposed on the Israelites in Egypt, in spite of their having increased at a phenomenal rate already. All of these developments are attested to in Ezekiel in 20, 8-9 when he referred to the descendants of Yaakov in Egypt becoming rebellious and refusing to honour their tribal obligations vis-à-vis the G'd of Avraham-Yitzchok, and Yaakov. The reason why the prophet dragged up such ancient history was only in order to make plain to the newly exiled nation that their misfortunes had always been due only to their betrayal of their covenant with G'd. Compare Isaiah 48,5 ואגיד לך מאז בטרם תבא השמעתיך פן תאמר עצבי עשם וגו' "therefore I told you long beforehand, announced things to you ere they happened; that you might not say: 'my idol cause them, my carved and molten images ordained them."


Verse 14

וגם את הגוי אשר יעבדו דן אנכי, just as I judge your descendants, for the wickedness with enslavement and cruel suppression, so I will judge the nation that enslaves them."

Chapter 16



Verse 1



Verse 2

הנה עצרני ה' מלדת, "even though G'd has promised to grant you offspring to whom I will give this land, (Genesis 12,7) He has not said that the mother of Avram's offspring would be I."
	אולי אבנה ממנה, Sarah hoped that the jealousy which would develop within her when she saw that Hagar gave birth to a child for Avram would stimulate her own biological and sexual urges so that in due course she too would become pregnant by her husband. (based on Megillah 13)
	שרי לקול, the Torah wants to make plain that Avram was not motivated by sexual lust to sleep with Hagar, but had only fallen in with Sarai's reasoning, hoping to assuage her feelings in the matter.
