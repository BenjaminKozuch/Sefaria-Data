Verse 1



Verse 2



Verse 3

Should you say, but Binyamin was born to him further into his old age, it must be said that all the sons of Ya'akov were born to him one after the other, in six years, all but Binyamin, born after a long interval. Everyone thought that he would have no more sons from her so they called Yosef Son of old Age. And even after Binyamin was born, they called him that because they had become accustomed to it.
Because the first explanation was problematic–what difference does it make if he was born in his old age or in the days of his youth? Therefore the Onkelos reference. Being for Rashi yet problematic to say of him "son of his old age," he questions the word זקונים in order to introduce the זיו איקונין interpretation. (Maharshal)
Regarding the difficulty in "what difference does it make," the text says that he made for him a k'tonet passim. If you argue that it is to teach that a person should not treat one of the sons differently, for on account of two selas by which Yosef's tunic was more valuable his brothers became jealous of him, this is not the intention of the text. (cf T. Shab 10b) For it is not written "His brothers feared because he made for him a k'tonet passim, but surely on account of his dreams and words they became jealous of him. Therefore he brings Midrash Agadah, etc. (Maharshal) He wants to say that פסים is acrostic for Potifera, sochrim, Yishma'elim, and Midyanim. It must be said regarding this agadah, that vav is missing from the word sochrim in the verse: "Men passed, Midyanim sochrim." (v.28) It should have been v'sochrim (and merchants). Further, absent in the text is selling of Yosef to merchants, and for that matter, neither is selling to Midyanim.  If it is not thus for merchants, why here?
