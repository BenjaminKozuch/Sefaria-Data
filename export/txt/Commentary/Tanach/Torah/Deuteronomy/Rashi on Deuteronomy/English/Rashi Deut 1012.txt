And now Israel, Even though you have done all this, God's compassion and affection are still upon you, and out of all that you have sinned before God, God does not "ask of you" "but to fear, etc."  ...
But our rabbis expounded from here, Everything is in the hands of heaven except for fear of Heaven. (Talmud Brachot 33)
