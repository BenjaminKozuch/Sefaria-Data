You made me weak like a female, for I was worried over you, and you weakened my hand. For I saw that you no longer yearned to come close [to G-d], with love. Would it not have been better to learn direct from the Almighty rather than myself?

... " To follow in all of His ways"- He is merciful and you should be merciful, He performs acts of kindness and you should perform acts of kindness

Here, the word "ki" functions in the sense of "perhaps": "Perhaps a tree of the field is human, and should be included in the proscription [of the town] before you, and should suffer with hunger and thirst just like the human inhabitants of the city?" Why would you destroy it!?

Verse 11

You may take her as your wife: The Torah speaks only in deference to the wicked inclination, for if God would not permit her [to him], he would take her illicitly. However, if he does marry her, he will ultimately come to hate her, as it says afterwards, "If a man has [two wives]" and ultimately he will father from her a wayward rebellious son. This is why these topics are placed one after the other.

...An additional possibility: This is the language of cool and heat, cooled you and stopped you from boiling.  All the nations of the world were afraid to fight you [Israel] and this one came and started and showed the way to others.  It is likened to a legend of a boiling bath that no creature could enter. A scoundrel came and jumped in.  Even though he was scalded, he cooled it down for others.
