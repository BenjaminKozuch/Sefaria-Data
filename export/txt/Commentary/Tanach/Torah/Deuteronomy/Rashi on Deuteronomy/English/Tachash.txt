Chapter 1



Verse 1

Because these are words of admonishment, and [because] he [Moshe] intended to recount here all the places where they [the Israelites] angered the Almighty, he therefore said these words in an obscure manner and only intimated [that they sinned in these places] to uphold the honor of Israel.
