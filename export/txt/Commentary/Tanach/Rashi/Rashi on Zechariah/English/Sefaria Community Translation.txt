For I bend Judah for Me– in the end, Antiochus will take the kingship from the hands of the kings of Persia and do evil to you. Then I will draw out Yehudah to be like my war bow and they will fight Antiochus in days of the Hasmoneans:
I filled Ephraim – this is a cut short statement which ought to read ‘like a bow; I filled the hand of Ephraim,’ similar to “…And Jehu put all his strength into his bow…” (Melachim II 9:24), meaning that Ephraim will be to Me as a quiver full of arrows:
and I will arouse your children, O Zion – upon the armies of Antiochus
