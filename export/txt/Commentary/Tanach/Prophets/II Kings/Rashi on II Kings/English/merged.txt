Chapter 4



Verse 1

She was the wife of Ovadia.
Any time the words "the sons of prophets" appears in scriptures, it means to say "students of the prophets.

Verse 2

a jug of oil: enough oil for anointment, yet the “aleph” is part of the root like the aleph of (Job 13:17) and my speech in your ears, [Heb. וְאַחְוָתִי, from חוה], and the “aleph” of (Ezek. 21:20) the crying of [those struck down] by the sword, [Heb. אִבְחַת, from נבח], to bark.


Verse 3



Verse 4

And you shall close the door: It affords respect to the miracle if it comes about in secret. 
from before you, and you shall place another vessel in its place to fill it, but the jug of oil you shall not move from its place, for the Holy One, Blessed be He, is making it as a spring, and it is not customary for a spring to move from its place. I heard this Midrash Aggadah

Verse 5

they were bringing to her: the vessels.

Verse 6

and the oil stopped: coming any more. [This is the] peshat. Mid. Aggadah in Gen. Rabbah 35 explains it literally: and the oil stood up, meaning that the price of oil went. up

Verse 7

And she came and told…: She came to receive advice whether to sell or to wait until it would become more expensive. He said to her, Go sell, for there is enough for all your debt, and for you and your sons to live with the remainder until the dead come to life.

Verse 8

he would stop: Heb. יסר, lit. he would stop. This is] the present tense, [i.e.,] he would stop there.

Verse 9

Behold now I know: For she never saw a fly on his table or semen on his sheet.

Verse 12



Verse 13

 amidst my relatives. No one harms me. I have need neither for the King nor for the general of the army.

Verse 14

“Now what can be done for her?”: to reciprocate for this favor

Verse 15



Verse 16

[lit. like the time, alive, i.e.] just as you are alive today, and well, so will you be alive next year at this time and embracing a son.
Do not say, “embracing a son.” Why do I need to embrace him if I will end up burying him? This is what she said to him when he died, “Did I not say, ‘Do not mislead me’?

Verse 17

I am sick in my head!

Verse 18



Verse 19

I am sick in my head!
His father [said] to one of the servants, “Carry him to his mother” .

quickly.
Do not keep back the riding because of me.

Verse 25



Verse 26

This is an abbreviated verse, So he should have written, “And he asked her, and she said, We are well.”

Verse 27



Verse 28

 to you, Do not fail your maidservant?

Verse 29

lit. do not bless him.] Do not ask him about his welfare. All this was done so that he would not be engaged in conversation, and he would ask him, “Where are you going?” And he would say, “To revive the dead.” Now, it is not respectful for the one through whom it is coming about, to praise himself He, however, did not do so. Instead, to every inquirer he would say, “My master sent me to revive the dead.”

Verse 33



Verse 34

Jonathan renders: וְאַלְהֵי עֲלוֹהִי This is an expression of weariness. [I.e., he lay exhausted upon him.] There is a similar word in the Baraitha of Haazinu and in Sifrei (references obscure). And Menahem interpreted [as follows]: The interpretation of the word according to its context, is: he prostrated himself upon him.

Verse 1

Is it possible to say so? Did not Uzziah and Jeroboam reign simultaneously, as I explained shortly before this (14:22)? What, then, is the meaning of the verse, “In the twenty seventh year of Jeroboam… Azariah… became king” ? That from that year, he reigned a plagued kingship. We learn that he was stricken with “zaraath” in the twenty-seventh year of his reign.

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5

It is explained in Chronicles (II 26:16-21) that he entered the heichal, the Temple proper, to burn incense on the altar of incense.
[lit. in a house of freedom] He made himself a house in the cemetery, as it is said (Ps. 88: 6), “Among the dead a free man.”

Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8

From here too it is possible to deduce that Azariah reigned from the time that Joash king of Israel died, fifteen years during the lifetime of Amaziah his father, for if he did not rise until his father died, it follows that he did not rise until the fifteenth year of Jeroboam the son of Joash. Now, since Jeroboam reigned forty-one years, it follows that Jeroboam died in the twenty-seventh year of Uzziah. Now, how does Scripture say, “In the thirty-eighth year” ? Rather, we are forced [to admit that] Uzziah and Jeroboam reigned simultaneously, except that Jeroboam reigned three years during the lifetime of his father Jehoash. Therefore, Scripture states (13:13), “and Jeroboam had sat on his throne,” meaning that he had already sat. Now Uzziah rose when Joash died and Jeroboam reigned as a full fledged monarch (lit. a full kingship). I saw in Seder Olam (ch. 19) that Jeroboam reigned one year during his father’s lifetime, and I do not know whether it is the copyists’ error, for I cannot reconcile [the verse reading,] “In the thirty eighth year of Azariah… Zechariah… reigned,” except in this manner.

Verse 9



Verse 10

Jonathan. [I.e.,] before the eyes of the people.

Verse 11



Verse 12

Not that his kingdom deserved to last that long, but to fulfill the word of the King, as it is said, (Is. 55:11) “So shall be My word, which will go forth from My mouth, [it will not return] to Me empty…”

Verse 13

Verse 16

[I.e.,] the mayor of the city did not open the city for him, to accept him as king over them.
The pregnant women therein, he ripped open.

Verse 25

His mighty warrior.

Every “argov” is an expression of important palaces, and every mention of “terachunin” in Aramaic (See Rashi, Deut. 3:4) means palaces important for the kingdom. [Hence, he assassinated him] in the great chamber that was next to the palace.
It is possible to say that a golden lion was standing in that palace (or chamber).

Verse 26



Verse 27



Verse 28



Verse 29



Verse 30

He should have said, “in the fourth year of Ahaz,” since Jotham’s entire reign lasted sixteen years, but since Ahaz was wicked, Scripture preferred to count them (i. e., the years) to Jotham who was in the grave, rather than to Ahaz, who was alive. Thus it is stated in Seder Olam (Ch. 22).

Israel
As far as a distress analogous to a woman sitting on the birth-stool, and she has no strength to give birth. The Hebrew is מַשְׁבֵּר - the name of the seat used by a woman who kneels to give birth.
Israel.
That the wicked are debating and showing evidence to their words, saying, “We have power and strength.”

Verse 4

Eprover in French, to prove. He showed evidence to his statement, that he prospered wherever he went.

Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7

And he will withdraw from you and return to his land. [He will] not [return] because of the rumor, but after awhile he will return shamefacedly, and I will cause him to fall there by the sword. Now what was the rumor? (v. 9) “And he heard [a rumor] about Tirhakah.” He heard that Tirhakah had gone out to wage war against him. Consequently, he withdrew from Jerusalem and went to Cush, and waged war with Tirhakah, Put and Egypt, who were with him. He defeated him and took their most coveted treasures, and came to Jerusalem, where he fell. In reference to this, Isaiah stated (Is. 45:14), “The toil of Egypt and the merchandise of Cush… will pass by you….”

Verse 8



Verse 9

To notify him that he was returning to his land only to wage war with Cush, and then to return here.

Verse 21



Verse 22



Verse 23

The Temple Mount.
The Temple which whitens the sins (Heb. מַלְבִּין).
I will not return until I have destroyed it.
[lit. the lodge of] its end.
The fullness of its land and the beauty of its splendor.

Verse 24

I.e., to say, I started all my deeds and completed [them], as one who digs a hole and finds strange water and drinks it. Flowing water he calls “strange” since until now no one knew of them.
If I would besiege a city reliant upon its rivers, I would bring many troops upon it who would dry up its rivers with their drinking and the drinking of their cattle and by the treading of their feet.

Verse 25

Why do you boast and aggrandize yourself with this? This is not yours, for you have heard from afar through the prophets, that I decreed upon the nations to bring you upon them, as the matter that is written (Is. 7:4), “Ho, Assyria, the staff of My wrath.” [In Is. 37:26 Rashi adds:] More than seventy years since Amos prophesied two years before the earthquake (Amos 7:17), “and Israel shall be exiled from upon its land.” Since then, you should have heard that I wrought and prepared this retribution.
Since the world was created, it entered My thought, as it is said (Is. 30:33), “For Gehinnom is arranged from days of yore; that too was prepared for the king.” This refers to Sennacherib, who was burned in the fire of Gehinnom, as it is said (Is. 31:9), “The word of the Lord, Who has fire in Zion.”
And this is the power that is in your hand.
The coming of My decree [shall be] to make desolate fortified cities into blossoming hills, into piles of earth upon which vegetables grow, for you destroy them because of My decree.
[לַהְשׁוֹת in Heb.] an expression of desolation, loneliness.

Verse 26

Those whom weakened before you, and the might is not yours. You are not mighty, but they are weak.
Which hastens to dry.
Like ears of grain, blasted before they hardened to become standing grain.

Verse 27

Jonathan paraphrased: And your sitting in counsel, and your going out to wage war, and your coming to the land of Israel, is revealed to Me. It emanated from Me.
And the fact that you will become arrogant and aroused against Me with anger and tumult. (Estomir in O.F.)

Verse 28


[חַחִי in Heb.] A kind of ring by which they pull an animal whose behavior is bad, as we learned (Shabbat 5:1), “And all animals that are usually pulled with a ring may go out with a ring.”
[Heb. מִתְגִי,] Jonathan rendered זְמַם, which is [made] of iron, and which they insert into the nostrils of a female camel, and she is pulled with it, since her behavior is bad. This is what we learned (Shabbath ibid.) “and the female camel with a nose ring.”

Verse 29

The prophet said this to Hezekiah. And this [prophecy] which I said to you that Sennacherib will fall here, will be a sign for you also for the approaching days, for you are afraid of dying from hunger, since Sennacherib destroyed the land and chopped down the trees.
This year plants will grow for you, and you will be sustained by them.
The chopped off trees that will grow (the products of the trees that will grow), and when you see My word fulfilled concerning the fall of the armies, it will be a sign for you that this promise, too, will be fulfilled.

Verse 30



Verse 31

That He will be zealous for His honor and for His name, not that you have any merit, for Ahaz your father committed many wicked deeds.

Verse 32

He shall not set a shield before it. [In Isaiah 37:33, Rashi adds,] Since the Aramaic translation of “before” is קֳדָם.
[Heb. סֹלְלָה,] a heap of earth to raise a mount upon which to stand to embattle the city. Since one presses it down and beats it with sticks and sledge hammers, so that it be trodden and pressed down with strength, it is called סֹלְלָה, an expression similar to (Is. 62:10) “Beat down, beat down the highway.” [Heb. סֹלוּ סֹלוּ הַמְסִלָה.]

Verse 33



Verse 34



Verse 35

When Sennacherib returned from [warring] with Cush, and he came as far as Nob, which was near Jerusalem.
All of them were heads of companies.

Verse 36

That is the capital of the land of Assyria. [In Isaiah 37:37, Rashi adds,] as it is said (Gen. 10:11), “From that land Ashur came out, and he built Nineveh…”

Verse 37

A board from Noah’s ark.
They heard him that he said he would slaughter them before him if they (sic) (he- kara) [would save him so that the princes of the kingdom, whose sons perished because of him, would not kill him].

However,… would not go up: The priests who burnt incense on the high places to idots, may not ascend anymore to serve on the altar of the Lord.
 	
they would eat unleavened cakes: meal-offerings, and likewise, all hallowed things.

Verse 10

This was the Molech. Since priests would bang on drums so that the father would not hear the groans of the child when he would be burned by the hands of the pagan image, Molech, they called it Topheth.

  Jonathan rendered: the craftsmen and the sentries of the gates, [translating harash as craftsmen, as in Ex. 28:11, and masger as closing, i.e., those who close the gates.] Our Rabbis, however, said that these were great Torah scholars, that when one would open his mouth to speak, all would remain silent, as it is written (Is. 41:1), “Keep silence  before Me, O islands.” “Masger,” all would sit before him and learn from him, as it is said (Is. 22:22), “And he will open, and no one will close, and he will close, and no one will open.”

Verse 15

and the dignitaries of the land: These are the dignitaries of Judah and Benjamin, who were righteous men. Concerning them the Scripture states (Jer. 24:5), “Like these good figs, so will I recognize the exiles of Judah.” (Copied from Chabad.org, same with the Rashis from pasuk 11 and 14)
