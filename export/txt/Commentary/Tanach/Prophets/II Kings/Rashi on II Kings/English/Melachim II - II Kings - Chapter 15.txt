Verse 1

Is it possible to say so? Did not Uzziah and Jeroboam reign simultaneously, as I explained shortly before this (14:22)? What, then, is the meaning of the verse, “In the twenty seventh year of Jeroboam… Azariah… became king” ? That from that year, he reigned a plagued kingship. We learn that he was stricken with “zaraath” in the twenty-seventh year of his reign.

Verse 5

It is explained in Chronicles (II 26:16-21) that he entered the heichal, the Temple proper, to burn incense on the altar of incense.
[lit. in a house of freedom] He made himself a house in the cemetery, as it is said (Ps. 88: 6), “Among the dead a free man.”

Verse 8

From here too it is possible to deduce that Azariah reigned from the time that Joash king of Israel died, fifteen years during the lifetime of Amaziah his father, for if he did not rise until his father died, it follows that he did not rise until the fifteenth year of Jeroboam the son of Joash. Now, since Jeroboam reigned forty-one years, it follows that Jeroboam died in the twenty-seventh year of Uzziah. Now, how does Scripture say, “In the thirty-eighth year” ? Rather, we are forced [to admit that] Uzziah and Jeroboam reigned simultaneously, except that Jeroboam reigned three years during the lifetime of his father Jehoash. Therefore, Scripture states (13:13), “and Jeroboam had sat on his throne,” meaning that he had already sat. Now Uzziah rose when Joash died and Jeroboam reigned as a full fledged monarch (lit. a full kingship). I saw in Seder Olam (ch. 19) that Jeroboam reigned one year during his father’s lifetime, and I do not know whether it is the copyists’ error, for I cannot reconcile [the verse reading,] “In the thirty eighth year of Azariah… Zechariah… reigned,” except in this manner.

Verse 9



Verse 10

Jonathan. [I.e.,] before the eyes of the people.

Verse 11



Verse 12

Not that his kingdom deserved to last that long, but to fulfill the word of the King, as it is said, (Is. 55:11) “So shall be My word, which will go forth from My mouth, [it will not return] to Me empty…”

[I.e.,] the mayor of the city did not open the city for him, to accept him as king over them.
The pregnant women therein, he ripped open.

Verse 25

His mighty warrior.

Every “argov” is an expression of important palaces, and every mention of “terachunin” in Aramaic (See Rashi, Deut. 3:4) means palaces important for the kingdom. [Hence, he assassinated him] in the great chamber that was next to the palace.
It is possible to say that a golden lion was standing in that palace (or chamber).

Verse 30

He should have said, “in the fourth year of Ahaz,” since Jotham’s entire reign lasted sixteen years, but since Ahaz was wicked, Scripture preferred to count them (i. e., the years) to Jotham who was in the grave, rather than to Ahaz, who was alive. Thus it is stated in Seder Olam (Ch. 22).
