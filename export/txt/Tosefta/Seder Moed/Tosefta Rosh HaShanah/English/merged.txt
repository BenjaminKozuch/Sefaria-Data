Tosefta Rosh HaShanah

Chapter 1

<i>Nisan</i> is the beginning of the year for kings and for [the three pilgrimage] festivals and for months and for the collection of shekels and there are those who say even for home rentals. How is it the beginning for kings? If a king dies in <i>Adar</i> and they appoint a successor while it is still <i>Adar</i>, a year of reigning is counted for the former king and the current one.  [Similarly], if a king dies in <i>Nisan</i> and they appoint a successor while it is still <i>Nisan</i> a year [of reigning] is counted for the former king and the current one. [However], if a king dies in <i>Adar</i> and they appoint a successor only in <i>Nisan</i>, the first year is counted for the first king and the second is counted for the second king.

R. Akiva said, “The Torah said:”
Bring an omer of barley on Pesah the season of barley so that the grain shall be blessed for you
Bring wheat and first fruits on Shavuot the season of the trees so that fruit of the trees will be blessed for you
Bring the water libation on Sukkot so that the water of the rains will be blessed for you
Say before me:
Malchuyot, Zichronot and Shofarot
Malchuyot so that you will crown me before them
Zichronot so that your memories will come before me for the good
Shofarot so that your prayers will ascend with trumpeting
