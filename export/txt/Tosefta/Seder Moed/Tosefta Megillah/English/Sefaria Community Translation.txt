Chapter 1

Cities surrounded by a wall from the time of Joshua bin Nun read [the megillah] on the fifteenth [of Adar].  Rabbi Yehuda ben Karchah says "[walled] since the time of Achashverosh".  Rabbi Yose said in the name of Rabbi Yehudah, "Was Shushan the palace walled since the time of Joshua bin Nun?״  'Each family, each state, each city' (Esther 9:28): Towns that are near the city and seem part of it are treated like it [with respect to reading the megillah on the 15th of Adar].
Those who go out in a caravan and those who travel on a ship read [the megillah] on the fourteenth [of Adar].  If [the fourteenth] falls on Friday, walled cities move the reading earlier to the day of gathering [Thursday] and large unwalled cities read on that day [Friday].  Rabbi Yose said "I say that inhabitants of walled cities should not read before the inhabitants of large unwalled cities, but should read on the same day as them, on that day [Friday]."  If [the fourteenth] falls on Shabbat, small towns move the reading earlier to the day of gathering [Thursday] and large unwalled cities read on Friday and walled cities on Sunday.  Rabbi [Yehuda Hanasi] said "I say that since the large unwalled cities have been moved from the appropriate day, they should be moved all the way up to the day of gathering [Thursday]."
Rabbi Yehudah said, "When [does the reading get moved up to the day of gathering]?  In a place that people gather on Monday and Thursday.  But in a place where people do not gather on Monday and Thursday, since people look at it [to determine when Pesach should start], they should look at it [read it] in its appropriate time." 
The reading of the megillah and the donation of shekels can be moved earlier but not moved later.  Uncertain [date of] circumcision, the time of the donation of wood for the alter, the 9th of Av, the hagigah offering, and hakhel can be moved later but not earlier.  Even though they said that megillah reading is moved earlier and not later, the megillah is read and [gifts for the needy] are collected and distributed on that day [the fourteenth] because the poor are look forward to the scheduled day of megillah reading, as it says (Esther 9:28) "These days will be remembered and practiced..." to fulfill the happiness in the appropriate time.
The collection of Purim is designated for Purim and the collection of a city is designated for that city.  One is not frugal with the collection of Purim, rather we buy with it calves and slaughter and eat them.  The extra money should (not) be added to the general charity fund.  Rabbi Akiva said "The collection of Purim should not be used to buy a shoe lace for a poor person."
Rabbi Meir said "One who borrows money from one's fellow to buy fruit should not use it to buy vessels; [...] to buy vessels should not use that it to buy fruit since she steals the mind of [misleads] the lender."  Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said in the name of Rabbi Meir "One who borrows money from one's fellow to buy a shirt should not use it to buy a cloak; [...] to buy a cloak should not use it to buy a shirt since she misleads the lender.
If they read the megillah in Adar I and the year was intercalated, they must read it in Adar II because all the mitzvot that are performed in Adar II are performed in Adar I.  R' Akiva said in the name of R' Yose in the name of R' Zecharya ben Hakatzav "They need not read it in Adar II because all the mitzvot that are performed in Adar II are not performed in Adar I except for [the restrictions on] eulogy and fasting that are performed in both."  Contracts in each month: In [Adar] I, we write "Adar" and in Adar II, it is written "Tinyan [Two]".
There is no difference between a holiday and Shabbat except for [work pertaining to preparation of] food.  R' Yehuda said "also [work pertaining to] allowing for [preparation of] food.  R' Nechunya ben Hakana said "Yom Kippur is like
