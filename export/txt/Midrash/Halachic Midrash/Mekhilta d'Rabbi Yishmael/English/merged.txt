It comes out that you will say; they are four sons:
One [who is] wise, one [who is] evil, 
one who is innocent and one who doesn't know to ask.
What does the wise [son] say? 
"What are these testimonies, statutes and judgments 
that the Lord our God commanded you?" 
And accordingly you will say to him, as per the laws of the Pesach sacrifice, 
"We may not eat an afikoman [a dessert or other foods eaten after the meal] after [we are finished eating] the Pesach sacrifice. (Mishnah Pesachim 10:8)"
What does the evil [son] say? 
"What is this worship to you?" 'To you' and not 'to him.' 
And since he excluded himself from the collective, he denied a principle [of the Jewish faith]. 
And accordingly, you will blunt his teeth, and say to him, 
"'For the sake of this, did the Lord do [this] for me in my going out of Egypt' (Exodus 13:8)." 'For me' and not 'for you.' 
If you had been there, you would not have been saved.
What does the innocent [son] say? 
"What is this?" 
And you will say to him, 
"'With the strength of [His] hand did the Lord take us out from Egypt, from the house of slaves' (Exodus 13:14).'"
And [regarding] the one who doesn't know to ask, you will open [the conversation] for him. 
As it is stated (Exodus 13:8), 
"And you will speak to your your son on that day saying, 
for the sake of this, did the Lord do [this] for me in my going out of Egypt."
