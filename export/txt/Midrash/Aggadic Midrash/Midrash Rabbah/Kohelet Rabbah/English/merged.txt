(8) "All the streams flow to the sea" (Ecclesiastes 1) -- All of Israel only ever gather together in Jerusalem, and they go up at the time of the festivals each and every year."Yet the sea is never full" (Ecclesiastes 1) -- Yet Jerusalem is never filled. As it was taught "They stand crowded, [yet] they bow spaciously". Rav Shmuel Bar Chova said in the name of Rav Acha who said, "Four cubits space between each and every one of them, and one cubit on each side, so that no one would hear the prayer of his friend and come to err"."To the place the streams flow [there they shall return again]" -- To the place Israel gathers in this world, there they shall gather in the world to come, in the time to come, as it is said (Isaiah 27) "And it shall be in that day, that a great horn shall be blown; and they shall come, those that were lost in the land of Assyria and those that were dispersed in the land of Egypt; and they shall worship G-d at the holy mountain in Jerusalem"

Perek 1













In the hour when the Holy One, Blessed be He, created the first person, He showed him all the trees of the Garden of Eden. He said to him, "See my works, how pleasant and praiseworthy they are. All of this I created for you. Be careful that you do not ruin and destroy my world, for if you ruin it there is no one who will repair it after you."

At the time that the Holy One created the first man, He introduced him to every tree in the Garden of Eden, and said to him, ‘See how wonderful and pleasant these trees are. And all of this I have created for you; therefore take great care that you do not damage and destroy My world, for if you do there is no one else to put right what you have destroyed.’
