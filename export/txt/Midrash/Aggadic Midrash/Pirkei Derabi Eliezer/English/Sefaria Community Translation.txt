Perek 1

...Rabbi Eliezer's students asked him: How do we know that The Holy One himself will take revenge on Edom? Immediately he answered: "Who has come from Edom" (Isaiah 63:1).  This is what King David prophetically said, "Moab is my wash pot, on Edom I throw my shoe" (Psalms 60:10, Psalms 108:10). [Regarding who is this written? Only] regarding The Holy One who will himself take revenge on Edom.  He told a parable: To what is this comparable?  To a king who built four palaces in four countries. He entered the first and ate and drank but didn't remove his shoes. Likewise with the second and third. He came to the fourth and ate and drank and removed his shoes. He told his servants, "Go out and bring me the great ones of this country, and they will dine with me."  They said to him, "Why, when you entered the first palace you didn't remove your shoes, and also with the second and third?" He said to them, "When I entered the first my mind wasn't settled, also with the second and third. Every moment I was saying [to myself], when will I see that time (when?) my mind will be settled. So too The Holy One.  He made war with Pharaoh, and with Amalek, and with Sisra, and with Sanherib, and with Nebucadezzer, and his mind wasn't settled until he himself took revenge [on Edom].
