 since it is made by the hands of man
The Master said: ‘In the name of R. Yose the Galilean they said:
Nor may a get be written upon it’
What is the reason for R. Yose the Galilean?
As it has been taught: [Scripture says], A scroll. I know only [that] a scroll [is valid], how do I know to include any other material? Scripture says, "And he wrote to her" 
implying, on whatever material it may be
If so, why does Scripture state, "scroll"? To teach you that just as a scroll is a thing which has no breath of life, and does not eat, so is everything valid which does not have the breath of life and does not eat.
And the Rabbis?
If Scripture had written "In a scroll", [it would be] as you say, but now that it is written "a scroll" it refers to the recital of the words. 
And how do the rabbis expound the words, "And he writes"? 
They need that [text for to teach that] 
with writing she becomes divorced, but she does not become divorced with money
Lest I would have said,
since her going out [from the married state] is compared to her entry into it just as her entry is with money, so is her exit, therefore it teaches us [this].
And from where does R. Yose the Galilean derive this? 
From [the words], ‘a scroll of divorce’; the scroll divorces and nothing else. And the others?
They need [this terminology to teach that the get must be] one which severs them [completely],
as it has been taught. 
[If a man say,] Here is your get on condition that you do not drink wine, or go to your father's house ever, it is not a proper severance. For thirty days, it is a severance. 
And the other? 
He deduces it from [the use of the form] kerituth [instead of that of] karet.
And the others?
They do not expound [the difference between] keritut and karet.
Mishnah. If he makes his sukkah between trees, and the trees form its walls, it is valid.
Gemara. R. Aha b. Jacob said, 
a partition which is unable to withstand a normal wind is not a valid partition. 
We have learned,
if he makes his sukkah between trees, so that the trees form its walls, it is valid. 
But do they not sway to and fro?
We are dealing here with solid [trees]. 
But are there not the swaying branches?
[It refers to] where he plaited it with shrubbery and bay-trees. 
If so, what does it come to teach us? 
One might have thought that
we should decree against this lest he come to make use of the tree, therefore he informs us [that it is valid].
Come and hear:
If there was there a tree, or a fence, or a partition of reeds, it is regarded as a valid corner-piece!
This also refers to where he plaited it with shrubbery and bay-trees.
Come and hear:
If a tree casts a shadow on the ground, it if the ends of its branches are not three handbreadths high above the ground it is permitted to carry underneath it. But why?
Does not the tree sway to and fro?
Here also it is a case where one plaited it with shrubs and bay-trees.
But if so, it should be permitted to carry objects over its whole area; 
why then did R. Huna the son of R. Joshua say:
One may not carry any objects there
