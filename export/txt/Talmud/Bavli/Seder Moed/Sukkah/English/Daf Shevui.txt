Daf 1b



Daf 2a

A sukkah which is more than twenty cubits high is not valid. Rabbi Judah validates it.
One which is not ten handbreadths high, or which does not have three walls, or which has more sun than shade, is not valid. 
GEMARA. We have learned elsewhere :
[The crossbeam] of an alley [whose entrance] is more than twenty cubits high should be lowered. Rabbi Judah says: this is unnecessary.
Now why is it different that when it comes to the Sukkah it is declared invalid, while with when it comes to [the cross-beam over] the alley, a remedy is indicated?
With regard to the Sukkah, since it is a toraitic mitzvah, it taught that it was invalid; with regard to [the cross-beam over] an alley, since it is only derabanan, a remedy is given. 
And, if you wish, you may say
that even with a toraitic mitzvah a remedy may be given,
but with regard to the sukkah, since there are many rules about it, it was briefly stated, invalid. [While in the case of a cross-beam over] an alley, since it has only one rule, it taught a remedy. 
From where do we know this?
Rabbah answered: Scripture says, 
"That your generations will know that I caused the children of Israel to dwell in sukkot" (Leviticus 23:43).

Rabbi Zera said: From the following verse,
