Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a

A sukkah which is more than twenty cubits high is not valid. Rabbi Judah validates it.
One which is not ten handbreadths high, or which does not have three walls, or which has more sun than shade, is not valid. 
GEMARA. We have learned elsewhere :
[The crossbeam] of an alley [whose entrance] is more than twenty cubits high should be lowered. Rabbi Judah says: this is unnecessary.
Now why is it different that when it comes to the Sukkah it is declared invalid, while with when it comes to [the cross-beam over] the alley, a remedy is indicated?
With regard to the Sukkah, since it is a toraitic mitzvah, it taught that it was invalid; with regard to [the cross-beam over] an alley, since it is only derabanan, a remedy is given. 
And, if you wish, you may say
that even with a toraitic mitzvah a remedy may be given,
but with regard to the sukkah, since there are many rules about it, it was briefly stated, invalid. [While in the case of a cross-beam over] an alley, since it has only one rule, it taught a remedy. 
From where do we know this?
Rabbah answered: Scripture says, 
"That your generations will know that I caused the children of Israel to dwell in sukkot" (Leviticus 23:43). Up to twenty cubits [high] one knows that he is dwelling in a sukkah, but with one higher than twenty cubits he does not ‘know’ that he is dwelling in a sukkah, since his eye does not catch sight of it.
Rabbi Zera said: From the following verse,
 "And there shall be a sukkah for shade in the daytime from the heat" (Isaiah 4:6). Up to twenty cubits [high] one sits in the shade of the sukkah; but with one higher than twenty cubits he sits, not in the shade of the sukkah but in the shade of its walls. 
Abaye said to him:
If so, if a man made his sukkah in Ashteroth Karnayim would it also not be a valid sukkah? 
He answered him: In that case, remove the Ashteroth Karnayim and there will remain the shade of the sukkah, but here, remove the walls, and youn have no shade of a sukkah.
Rava replied: From the following verse,
 "You shall dwell in sukkot for seven days" (Leviticus 23:42)
the Torah declared:
For seven days leave your permanent dwelling place and dwell in a temporary dwelling place. 
Up to twenty cubits [high] one makes his home a temporary one; higher than twenty cubits, one does not make his home temporary, but permanent.
Abaye said to him:
If so, if he made walls of iron and placed the [proper] skhakh over them, would it also not be a valid Sukkah.
He answered him: This is what I mean to tell you:
Up to twenty cubits, which a man makes his temporary home, even if he makes it permanent,he has fulfilled his mitzvah;
 [but in one] higher than twenty cubits, such as a man makes his permanent home, even if he makes it temporary, he has not fulfilled his obligation.

Daf 2b



Daf 3a



Daf 3b



Daf 4a



Daf 4b

if the distance was less than three handbreadths it is valid.
Why do we say there ‘less than four cubits’, and here ‘less than three handbreadths’?
There where there is a wall, it is sufficient [if the distance is] less than four cubits; here, however, where a wall has to be made, [if the distance is] ‘less than three handbreadths’ it is[valid]; otherwise it is not.
If [a sukkah] was more than twenty cubits high and one built in it a pillar ten handbreadths high, and [the pillar] was large enough for a valid sukkah,[in this case] Abaye intended
to draw the partitions upward,
[But] Rava said to him:
we require recognizable partitions and there are not.
Our rabbis taught:
If he drove four poles into the ground and put skhakh on top of them: R. Jacob declares it valid and the sages declare it invalid.
R. Huna stated:
The dispute relates only [to poles erected] on the edge of a roof: R. Jacob holds that
we apply the rule of ‘draw the partition upward’ while the sages hold that 
we do not apply the rule of ‘draw the partition upward’.
But [if they were] in the middle of the roof, all agree that [the sukkah is] invalid.
R. Nahman said:
there is a dispute if [the poles are] in the middle of the roof. 
They asked:
[Does he mean that] the dispute concerns only [poles that were erected] in the middle of the roof,  but if such were erected on the edge of the roof all agree that it is valid, 
or is it possible
[that he means that] the dispute concerns both cases?
The question remains undecided.
An objection was raised:
If one drove poles in the ground and placed the Sukkah-covering over them, R. Jacob declares [such a sukkah] valid, and the sages declare it invalid.
Now the ground is like the middle of a roof and still R. Jacob validates [the sukkah].
Is this not, then, a refutation of R. Huna? It is indeed a refutation.
Moreover,
they dispute concerning the middle of the roof only but if he put [poles up] on the edge of the roof they all agree that it is valid. Shall we say then that this will refute R. Huna on two points?
R. Huna could answer you:
They disagree about poles in the middle of the roof, and likewise also about those on the edge. 
And the reason why the dispute concerns the middle of the roof is in order to show you how far R. Jacob's view extends that even where the poles were in the middle of the roof he holds [the Sukkah] to be valid.
Our rabbis taught:If he drove four poles into the ground and covered them with the skhakh, R. Jacob says: 
found that on being planed and smoothed there would remain the width of a handbreadth on this side and on this side, they are treated as a two-sided pillar, but if not, they cannot be treated as two-sided pillars
for R. Jacob used to say,
the prescribed minimum width of a two-sided pillar of a sukkah is a handbreadth. But the sages say: only if two [of the adjacent walls] are proper [walls], may the width of the third be only a handbreadth.
ONE WHICH IS NOT TEN HANDBREADTHS HIGH.
How do we know this?
It was stated: 
Rav, R. Hanina, R. Yohanan and R. Haviva taught: 
(throughout all Seder Mo'ed when these pairs are mentioned together [some] substitute the name of R. Yonatan for that of R. Yohanan),
the ark [of the covenant] was nine handbreadths high, and the ark cover one handbreadth, making a total of ten handbreadths, and it is written, "And there I will meet with you, and I will speak with you from above the arkcover" (Exodus 25:22)

Daf 5a

and it has been taught, R. Yose stated:
The Shechinah never descended to earth, nor did Moses or Elijah ever ascend to Heaven, as it is said, 
‘The heavens are the heavens of the Lord, but the earth He has given to humanity" (Psalm 119:16). 
But did the Shechinah not descend to earth?
Isn't it written,
"And the Lord came down upon Mount Sinai?" (Exodus 19:20)?
That was above ten handbreadths [from the summit]. 
But is it not written,
"And His feet shall stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives?" (Zechariah 14:4)? Above ten handbreadths. 
But did not Moses and Elijah ascend to Heaven?
Is it not in fact written, 
"And Moses went up unto God?" (Exodus 19:3).
[That was] to a level lower than ten [handbreadths from heaven]. 
But is it not written,
"And Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven?"(II Kings 2:11)
[That was] to a level lower than ten handbreadths
But is it not written, 
"He seizes hold of the face of His throne, and He spreads His cloud upon him," (Job 26:9)  and R. Tanhum said:
This teaches that the Almighty spread some of the radiance of his Shechinah and his cloud upon him?
That was at a level lower than ten handbreadths. 
But in any case is it not written, "He seizes hold of the face of His throne"?
The throne was well lowered for his sake until [it reached a level] lower than ten handbreadths [from Heaven] and then he seized hold of it.
One can understand that the ark was nine [handbreadths high]  since it is written, 
"And they shall make an ark of acacia wood: two cubits and a half shall be its length, and a cubit and a half its breadth, and a cubit and a half its height"(Exodus 25:10). 
But how do we know that the ark-cover was a handbreadth [high]? 
From that which R. Hanina taught:
For all the vessels which Moses made, the Torah gave the measurements of their length and breadth and height, 
[except in the case of] the ark-cover, its length and its breadth are given, but not its height.
Go and deduce it from the smallest of the vessels, concerning which it is said, ...
"And you shall make for it a border of a handbreadth around" (Exodus 25:25) Just as there the height was a handbreadth so was it here also a handbreadth 
But why should our deduction not be made from the vessels themselves?
If you seized a large amount, you have notseized anything; but if you seized the lesser amount you have seized.
But why should we not derive it from the golden headplate (ציץ), as it was taught:
The tzitz was in the shape of a plate of gold two finger-breadths broad and stretching from ear toear,  and upon it were engraved two lines,
 Yod and Heh above, and Kodesh [followed by a] Lamed below, and R. Eliezer son of R. Yose said,
I saw it in Rome and it had Kodesh Ladonai on one line. 
We deduce [the measurements of a] vessel from another vessel, but we do not deduce [the measurements of a] vessel from an ornament.
Why then should we not deduce from the crown, of which a master stated:
The crown was on the smallest possible size?
We deduce the size of a vessel from that of another vessel, but not from an accessory to a vessel.
If so, [it may be objected] was not the border also an appurtenance of a vessel?
The border was below [the top of] the table.
This is correct according to the authority who holds that the border was below, but according to the authority who holds that it was above what can one say? 
It is only an accessory
to a vessel!
Rather one adduces the size of a thing some of whose measurements are given by the Torah from another thing whose measurements are given by the Torah, but no deduction can be made from the headplate or the crown of which the Torah gave no measurements at all
R. Huna said: [The height of the ark-cover may be deduced] from here,
 "Upon the face of the ark-cover" (Leviticus 16:14) on the east, and a 'face’ is not smaller than a handbreadth.
But perhaps it means a face like 

Daf 5b

that of the Bar-Yokani? 
If you seized a large amount, you have not seized anything; but if you seized the lesser amount you have seized
But perhaps it means a face like that of a tziparta which is very small? 
R. Aha b. Jacob said:
R. Huna draws an analogy between two expressions of ‘face’. 
It is written here, 
‘[Upon the face of the ark-cover", and it is written elsewhere,
"From the face of Isaac his father" (Genesis 27:30).
But why should we not learn from the ‘face’ above concerning which it is written,
"As one sees the face of God, and You were pleased with me?" (Genesis 33:10).
If you seized a large amount, you have not seized anything; but if you seized the lesser amount you have seized.
Let us learn from the cherub
concerning which it is written, "Toward the face of the ark-cover shall the faces of the cherubim be?" (Exodus 25:20). 
R. Aha b. Jacob answered: We have a tradition that
the face of the cherubim were not less than a handbreadth
and R. Huna too made his deduction from this verse. 
What is a "cherub"?
R. Abahu said,
 ‘Like a child’, for in Babylon they call a child Ravia.
Abaye said to him:
 If so, how will you explain that which is written, 
 "The first face was the face of the cherub and the second face the face of a man," (Ezekiel 10:14) seeing that the face of a cherub is the same as that of a man? 
[One has] a large face and the other a small face
But how do we know that the height of the interior space exclusive of the skhakh, must be ten [handbreadths].
Say that it might include the skhakh!
Rather he learned this from the Temple  as it is written,
 "And the house which King Solomon built for the Lord, its length was sixty cubits, and its breadth twenty cubits, and its height thirty cubits," (II Kings 6:2) and it is written,
 "The height of the one cherub was ten cubits and so was it of the other cherub," (II Kings 6:26) and it was taught: Just as we find in the Temple that the cherubim reached to a third of its height so also in the Tabernacle they reached to a third of its height. 
Now what was the height of the Tabernacle? Ten cubits, as it is written, 
 "Ten cubits shall be the length of a board" (Exodus 26:16). 
How much is this? Sixty handbreadths. 
How much is a third? Twenty handbreadths. 
Deduct the ten of the ark and the ark-cover, and ten handbreadths remain; and it is written,
"And the cherubim shall spread out their wings on high, covering the ark-cover with their wings" (Exodus 25:20). 
[From which we see that] that the Merciful One calls [the wings that were stretched] above a height of ten handbreadths a ‘covering."
But how do we know that their wings were above their heads?
Is it not possible that they were on a level with their heads.
R. Aha b. Jacob answered,
It is written ‘On high’. 
But perhaps this means that the wings were raised very high?
Is it then written, ‘On high, on high’?
This explanation is satisfactory according to R. Meir,
who says that all the cubits [in the Sanctuary] were normal cubits, 
but according to R. Judah who says that
the cubits of the building were six handbreadths, but of the vessels were five, what can be said? 
For how much [then] were the ark and cover? Eight and a half, so that eleven and a half handbreadths are left. Shall we [therefore] say that a Sukkah must be [at least] eleven and a half [handbreadths high]?
Rather
for R. Judah the law was learned as a tradition,
for R.Hiyya b. Ashi in the name Rav:
The laws concerning [minimal measures], interpositions and partitions are [a part of the] halakhah that was given to Moses on Sinai.
But are not the laws relating to minimum measures 
from the Torah
 since it is written,
 "A land of wheat and barley, and vines and fig-trees and pomegranates, a land of olive-trees and honey, (Deuteronomy 8:8)
And R. Hanin stated that
all this verse was said in allusion to the prescribed minimum measures. 
‘Wheat’ is an allusion to the house afflicted with scale disease as we have learned:
 If a person entered a house afflicted with a nega, carrying his clothes upon his shoulders, and his sandals and rings in his hands, both he and they become unclean immediately. 

Daf 6a

If, however, he was wearing his clothes and had his sandals unclean immediately, but they remain clean, unless he stayed as much time as is required for the eating of half a loaf of wheat bread and not of barley bread, while in a reclining posture and eating with some condiment. 
‘Barley’— As we have learned:
 A barleycorn's bulk of a [human] bone defiles by contact and by carrying, but not by ‘overshadowing’.
‘Vines’ [are an allusion to] the quarter of a log of wine [which is the minimum prohibited] to a Nazirite.
‘Fig-trees’ allude to the size of a dry fig [which is the minimum measurement for transgressing the law against] carrying out [food] on Shabbat.
‘Pomegranates’? As we have learned:
All vessels belonging to householders [become clean if the holes in them] are as large as pomegranates. 
"A land of olive-oil" [is an allusion to the] land all of whose [minimum] standards [for mandated and forbidden things] is the bulk of an olive.
How can it possibly mean all minimum measures?
But aren't there those which we have just mentioned? 
Say rather, ‘The majority of whose [minimum] measures are the bulk of an olive....
‘Honey’ alludes to the size of a large date, [which is the minimum size forbidden] on Yom Kippur.
Therefor [the minimum measures] are clearly from the Torah.
Do you then imagine that measures were actually written in the Torah?
Rather,
they are traditions and the verse is merely a support. 
But are not [the laws of] interposition from the Torah, as it is written,
"And he shall wash his body in water" (Leviticus 14:9) [which implies] that nothing should interpose between him and the water? 
The traditional law comes [to teach] concerning one's hair, in agreement with a statement of Rabbah b. Bar Hana,
or Rabbah b. Bar Hana stated: 
 One knotted hair constitutes an interposition, three hairs do not, but I do not know [the law in the case of] two.
But is not the law relating to one's hair also from the Torah, 
since it was written, "And he shall wash [et] his body in water" and [the word] et includes that which is joined to his body. And what is that? His hair.
The tradition comes to teach as did R. Yitzchak;
for R. Yitzchak said:

Daf 6b

From the Torah if it is majority of one's hair and he does mind it, it interposes but if he doesn't mind it does not interpose.
But they decreed concerning a case where it is a majority and he doesn't mind on account of a case where it is a majority and he does mind, and [they also decreed] concerning a case where it is a minority and he does mind it on account of a case where it is a majority and he does mind.
Let us also decree concerning a case where it is not a majority and he doesn't mind on account of a case where it is not a majority and he does mind, or on account of a case where it is a majority and he doesn't mind. 
This ruling itself is only a rabbinic decree; we come and institute a decree lest someone transgress another thing which is only a decree?
[As for the laws of] partitions, these are those referred to above. 
That works according to R. Judah, but according to R. Meir what can one say?
The tradition refers to [the legal fictions] of extension, lavud, and the curved wall.
Or a sukkah which does not have three walls.
Our rabbis taught: 
Two [walls] must be of the prescribed dimensions, and the third [may be] even one handbreadth.
Rabbi Shimon says: 
Three walls must be of the prescribed dimensions, and the fourth [may be] even one handbreadth
What principle are they arguing about?...
The rabbis hold that
the traditional Scriptural text is authoritative, while R. Shimon holds 
that the traditional reading is authoritative.
‘The rabbis hold that the traditional Scriptural text is authoritative’, and the word Sukkoth occurs twice defectively and once with the full spelling, making four references.   Deduct one for the law itself, and three remain;
two [walls at least] must be of the prescribed dimensions, and tradition came and diminished [the prescribed minimum of] the third, reducing it to only one handbreadth.
R. Shimon holds that 
the traditional reading is authoritative’. 
The word Sukkoth is read three times, which equals six [references]. Deduct one Scriptural reference for the law itself and four remain; 
three walls at least of prescribed dimensions, and tradition came and diminished the [prescribed minimum of the] fourth and reduced it to a handbreadth.
And if you wish you can say
that they all agree that the traditional reading is authoritative but they differ on this; 
.one Master holds that.
the skhakh needs a Scriptural reference, while the other Master holds
that it does not.
And if you wish you can say
hat they are unanimous that the traditional Scriptural text is authoritative, but they differ on this principle; 
one Master holds that the tradition comes to diminish while the other holds 
that tradition comes and adds to it. 
And if you wish you can say
that both agree that tradition comes to diminish and that the traditional Scriptural text is authoritative, but they differ as to whether one uses first [references] for exegesis: 
one Master holds that
we do expound upon first references,
and the other Master holds 
that we do not.
R. Matanah said:
The reason of R. Shimon is a derivationfrom the following verse:
"And there shall be a Sukkah for shade during the day from the heat, and for a refuge and for a cover from storm and from rain" (Isaiah 4:6). 
.This handbreadth [of a wall] where does he place it? 
Rav said:
He places it opposite the departing wall. 
R. Kahana and R. Assi said to Rav:

Daf 7a

Why not place it opposite the head of the diagonal wall? 
Rav remained silent.
 Shmuel said in the name of Levi:
He places it opposite the departing wall.
And so they rule in the Bet Midrash: 
He places it opposite the departing wall.
R. Simon (or, as some say, R. Joshua b. Levi) ruled:
One makes [the additional wall of the width of] a loose handbreadth and places it within three handbreaths of the wall, since whatever is less than three handbreadths from the wall is regarded as joined to the wall.
Rav Judah said: 
A sukkah made like an [open] alley-way is valid,  and this handbreadth [wall] is placed in whatever side one pleases.
R. Simon (or, as some say, R. Joshua b. Levi) says,
He makes a strip of slightly more than four [handbreadths] and places it within three handbreadths of the wall, since whatever is less than three handbreadths from the wall is regarded as joined to the wall.
But why did you say in the previous case that one loose handbreadth suffices while here you say that there must be a strip of four handbreadths?
There where there are two valid walls, a loose handbreadth suffices, but here where there are not two valid walls, if there is a strip of four handbreadths it is valid, otherwise, it is not [valid].
Rava ruled:
It is only permitted if it has the form of a doorway.
There are others that say: Rava said:
And it is also valid if it has the form of a doorway.
There are others that say: Rava said: 
And it also requires the form of a doorway.
R. Ashi found R. Kahana making [the third wall of aSukkah] a loose handbreadth wide and constructing also the form of a doorway. 
He said to him: 
Does not the Master hold the opinion of Rava 
who said that it is also valid with the form of a doorway?
He answered:
I hold like the other reading of [the statement of] Rava that in addition [to a board of the size of a handbreadth]
the form of a doorway is also necessary.
‘Two walls must be of the prescribed dimensions etc.’ 
Rava said:
And similarly with regard to the Shabbat.
Since [the handbreadth] is regarded as a valid wall of the Sukkah it is also regarded as a valid wall in respect of the Sabbath.
Abaye raised an objection against him:
Do we then apply the rule of ‘since’?
Was it not in fact taught:
 ‘[The rules relating to] a wall of a Sukkah are the same as those relating to a wall for Shabbat, as long as there is no gap of three handbreadths between any two reeds. 
And the [law relating to] Shabbat is more [stringent] than that of Sukkah, in that a [wall for purposes of] the Sabbath is valid only if its standing portion is greater than its gaps, which is not the case with the Sukkah’
And the [law relating to] 
Shabbat is more [stringent] than that of Sukkah, in that a [wall for purposes of] the Sabbath is valid only if its standing portion is greater than its gaps, which is not the case with the Sukkah’
No, [it means that the law relating to] an ordinary Shabbat is more [stringent] than [the law relating to] the Sabbath of the Sukkah.
But if this is so, let it also be stated:
 [The law relating to] the ordinary Sukkah is more [stringent] than [that of] the Sukkah of Shabbat since [the validity of] an ordinary Sukkah demands a width of a loose handbreadth [for the third wall] while [the validity of] the Sukkah of Sabbath does not require the width of a loose handbreadth [for a wall] but a side-post alone is sufficient, 
for it is you who ruled 
that if one placed skhakh over an alleyway which has a side-post it is valid?
There was no need to mention this, [since it is obvious that] if we apply [the rule of ‘since’] from the less stringent to the more stringent, all the more so apply it from the more stringent to the less stringent
[Reverting to] the main subject: Rav said:

Daf 7b

If one placed skhakh over an alley-way which has a side-post it is valid.
And Rava further said:
If one placed skhakh over the [upright] boards around wells it is valid [as a sukkah].
And [all the three laws were] necessary. For if he had mentioned only [the law relating to] the alleyway one would have assumed [that there the sukkah is valid] because it had two proper walls, but that in the case of partitions of wells, which do not have not two proper walls, the sukkah is not valid.
And if we had been informed of the boards around wells only, one would have assumed [that there the sukkah is valid] because there are four walls, but that if one placed skhakh over an alleyway, where there are not four walls, it is not [valid].
And if we had been informed of both those laws [but not of the third,] one would have assumed that from the more stringent to the less stringent [we apply the rule of ‘since’] but not from the less stringent to the more. [Therefore all the three rules were] necessary.
OR WHICH HAS MORE SUN THAN SHADE IS NOT VALID. 
Our rabbis taught:
Sunshine due to the [lack] of skhakh, not sunshine due to [the gaps in] the wall.
R. Yoshayah says:
Even where it is due to [the gaps in] the walls. 
Rav Yemar b. Shelemiah said in the name of Abaye:
 What is the reason of R. Yoshayah? As it is written:
"And you shall cover the ark with the veil" (Exodus 40:3).
Now since the ‘veil’ was a partition and the Torah called it a ‘covering’
 it is evident
 that a partition [for the sukkah] must be as [close] as the covering.
And as for the rabbis?
— It means that the veil should bend over a little [at the top] so that it might look like a covering. 
Abaye said:
Rabbi, R. Josiah, R. Judah, R. Shimon, R. Gamaliel, Beth Shammai, R. Eliezer and ‘others’ -all hold the opinion that 
 the Sukkah must be constructed like a permanent abode. 
‘Rabbi’? — As it has been taught: Rabbi said:
A sukkah which is not four cubits square is invalid.
‘R. Yoshayah? — As we have [just] stated.
‘R. Judah’? — As we have learned:...
 A sukkah which is more than twenty cubits high is not valid, R. Judah declares it valid.
‘R. Shimon? — As it has been taught:
Two [walls] must be of the prescribed dimensions and the third [may be] even one handbreadth.
‘R. Shimon said:
Three [walls] must be of the prescribed dimensions and the fourth [may be] even one handbreadth.
‘R. Gamaliel’? — As it has been taught:
One who builds his sukkah on the top of a wagon or on the deck of a ship. R. Gamaliel declares it invalid and R. Akiba declares it valid.
‘Beth Shammai’? As we have learned:
 If his head and the greater part of his body were within the sukkah and his table was within the house, Beth Shammai declare it invalid, and Beth Hillel declare it valid
‘R. Eliezer? As we have learned:
One who builds his sukkah like a cone-shaped hut or if he propped it up against a wall, R. Eliezer declares it invalid, since it has no roof’, and the sages declare it valid.
The ‘others’? As it has been taught: Others say:
 A sukkah made like a dovecote is invalid, since it has no corners.
R. Yohanan said:
A sukkah which was [round shaped] like a furnace: If twenty-four men can sit around its circumference, it is valid, and if not it is invalid
According to whom [is this statement]?
According to Rabbi who says that a sukkah which is not four cubits square is invalid.
Since a man occupies the space of a cubit, and where the circumference [of a circle] is three handbreadths its diameter is one handbreadth, it would therefore be enough of only twelve men [can sit around it]?

Daf 8a

That applies only to a circle, but in the case of a square, a greater perimeter is required.
But consider: By how much is a square greater than its [inscribed] circle? By a quarter. Should it then not suffice if only sixteen [men can be seated around it]?
That is so in the case of a circle inscribed within a square, but if a square is to be inscribed within a circle a greater circumference is required on account of the projection of the corners....
But consider: If the side of a square is a cubit, its diagonal is approximately one and two fifths cubits.  Should not then [a circumference equivalent to] sixteen and four fifths [cubits] suffice?
[R. Johanan] gave only an approximate figure.
Say that we say that [where the discrepancy is] small he might approximate, but could such an assumption be made [where the discrepancy is] big?
Mar Kashisha the son of R. Hisda said to R. Ashi:
Do you think that a man occupies one cubit?
. [The fact is that] three men occupy two cubits..
How much then does this [amount to for twenty-four men]?. Sixteen cubits; and we [really] demand here sixteen and four fifths.
[Because, as has been said, R. Yohanan] gave only an approximate figure...
Say that we give approximate figures in order to create a where this makes the law lenient?
R. Assi said to R. Ashi: 
In truth, a man occupies a cubitspace, but R. Yohanan does not include the space occupied by the men.
How many [cubits] does this[amount to]? Eighteen; while sixteen and four-fifths would be enough.
That is [then] what was meant [when it was stated] that he only gave an approximate figure; and in this case it is in the direction of stringency.
The rabbis of Caesarea (and some say, the judges of Caesarea) say:
The circumference of a circle inscribed in a square is a quarter;

Daf 8b

but the square inscribed within that circle is a half.
But this is not correct, for we see that these are not so much bigger.
R. Levi said in the name of R. Meir:
Two sukkot of potters one further in than the other, the inner one is not valid as a sukkah, and is obligated to have a mezuzah while the outer one is valid as a Sukkah, and is exempt from the obligation of a mezuzah.
But why should this be so?
Why shouldn't the outer one be regarded as the gate-house of the inner one, and therefore be obliged to have a mezuzah? 
Because neither [booth] is of a permanent nature.
Our rabbis taught:
<i>ganbak (a mnemonic): </i>
 a sukkah of gentiles, women, cattle or Samaritans and any sukkah whatsoever is valid, provided that it is covered according to the rule. 
What is meant by ‘according to the rule’?
R. Hisda answered: 
 Provided that [the covering] was made [with the intention of providing] the shade for the sukkah.
What does "any sukkah whatsoever" come to include?
It includes the sukkot [whose mnemonic is] <i>rakbash,</i>
as our rabbis taught:
Sukkot [whose mnemonic is] <i>rakbash,</i>
The sukkah of shepherds, the sukkah of figwatchers the sukkah of city guards, and the sukkah of orchard-watcher, and any sukkah whatsoever is valid, provided that it is covered according to the rule.
What is meant by ‘according to the rule’?
R. Hisda answered:
provided [the covering] was made [with the intention of providing] the shade for the sukkah.
What does ‘any sukkah whatsoever’ include? 
It includes the sukkot [whose mnemonic] is <i>ganbak.</i>
The tanna of <i>ganbak</i>
regards these sukkot as possessing greater validity because they are permanent, and therefore he used the expression, "any sukkah whatsoever" to include <i>rakbash</i> which are not permanent.
While the tanna of <i>rakbash</i> regards the <i>rakbash</i> sukkot possessing greater validity since they belong to those who are bound [by the commandment of sukkah] and therefore he used the expression, "any sukkah whatsoever" to include the <i>ganbak</i> sukkot which belong to those who are not bound [by the commandment of sukkah].

Daf 9a

Mishnah: An old sukkah: Bet Shammai invalidates it and Bet Hillel validates it. 
What is an “old sukkah”?
Any one which he made thirty days before the festival;
but if he made it for the purpose of the festival, even at the beginning of the year, it is valid.
Gemara. What is Beth Shammai's reasoning?...
Scripture says, "The festival of Sukkot, for seven days unto the Lord" (Leviticus 23:34) we require a Sukkah made expressly for the sake of the festival.
And Beth Hillel?
They need that [verse] for the statement of R. Shesheth, 
R. Shesheth said in the name of R. Akiba, 
How do we know that the wood of the Sukkah is forbidden all the seven [days f the Festival]? From Scripture which states, "The festival of Sukkoth, seven days to the Lord."
And it was taught, R. Judah b. Batera says: 
Just as the name of Heaven rests upon the festival sacrifice, so does it rest upon the Sukkah, since it is said, ‘The Festival of Sukkoth, seven days to the Lord’: just as the Festival [offering] is ‘to the Lord’, so is the sukkah also ‘to the Lord’.
And Beth Shammai also, do not they need the verse for this deduction?
Yes, indeed.
What then is Bet Shammai's reason? -There is another Scriptural verse
 "You shall make the festival of Sukkoth for seven days" (Deuteronomy 16:13). This implies that we require a sukkah made expressly for the sake of the Festival.
And Bet Hillel?
They need this verse to teach that a sukkah may be made in the intermediate days of the Festival.
And Bet Shammai? — They hold the same opinion as R. Eliezer, 
who said that no sukkah may be made in the intermediate days of the Festival.
But doesn't Bet Hillel agree with the statement of Rav Judah in the name of Rav
 for Rav Judah said in the name of Rav:
If a man made [tzitzit] from the hanging web or woof, or sewing threads, they are invalid; but if he made them from a tuft [sewn to a garment] they are valid. 
When I repeated this in the presence of Shmuel he said to me: 
Even if from a tuft [sewn to a garment] they are also not valid, because it is necessary that the weaving shall be done specifically for its purpose.
Here too then we should require a sukkah be made specifically for its purpose?
[Tzitzit are] different, since Scripture says, "You shalt make for yourself twisted cords" (Deuteronomy 22:12): "for yourself" [means] for the specific purpose of your obligation
But here also [Scripture says], "The festival of Sukkot you shall make for yourself," "for yourself" for the specific purpose of your obligation
That [phrase] is needed to exclude a stolen [Sukkah]. 
But in the other case too it is needed to exclude stolen [tzitzit]?
In that case there is another verse, 
 "And they shall make for themselves" (Numbers 15:38) of their own.

Daf 9b

Mishnah. One who makes his sukkah under a tree, it is as if he made it within the house. 
One [who makes] a sukkah on top of another sukkah, the upper one is valid but the lower is invalid.
Rabbi Judah says:
if there are no occupants in the upper one, the lower one is valid.
Gemara. Rava said:
 [Our mishnah] was taught only in respect of’ a tree whose shade is greater than the sun [shining through its branches] but if the sun is more than its shade, it is valid.
How [do we know this]? Since it states, "it is as if he made it within the house."Now why did it teach, it is as if he made it within the house?
 Let it simply state ‘it is invalid’? 
Rather this is what it teaches us:
the tree [referred to is] like a house, just as in a house the shade is more than the sunshine, so the tree has more shade than sunshine.
But even where the sun is more than the shade, so what? 
Behold he joins invalid skhakh with valid skhakh?
R. Papa answered:
[This is a case] where he interwove [the branches of the tree].
If the branches were interwoven, why mention the case at all?
One might have thought that
it should be prohibited where it is interwoven lest he regard it as valid even where it was not interwoven, [therefore the mishnah] informs us that we don't decree against it.
Have we not learned this also:
 If a man trained upon it [a sukkah] vine, or a gourd, or ivy, and he covered [it with a valid covering], it is invalid
But if the valid covering exceeded these in quantity, or if one cut them, it is valid. 
Now to what case does this refer?
Now to what case does this refer? If I say where he did not interweave them, then behold he joins the invalid covering to the valid one? Rather it refers to a case where one did interweave them; and we learn from here that we don't decree against this?What might you have thought? 
That [this is permissible] only ex post facto but not ab initio, hence we were informed 
One sukkah above another sukkah… 
Our Rabbis taught,
"You shall dwell in Sukkoth" (Leviticus 23:42), but not in a sukkah under another sukkah, nor in a Sukkah under a tree, nor in a Sukkah within the house. On the contrary! The word "in sukkot" implies two?
R. Nahman b. Isaac answered: 
The word is written defectively
R. Jeremiah said:
Sometimes both are valid, sometimes both invalid; sometimes the lower one is valid and the upper invalid, and sometimes the lower one is invalid and the upper one valid.
‘Sometimes both are valid:' In what circumstances? When in the lower one the sun is more than the shade, and in the upper the shade is more than the sun, and the upper one is within twenty [cubits from the ground]. ‘Sometimes both are invalid’.  In what circumstances? When in both of them the shade is more than the sun, and the upper one is more than twenty cubits [high]. 
Sometimes the bottom one is valid and the upper one is invalid?

Daf 10a

In what circumstances? When the lower one has more shade than sun, and the upper one more sun than shade, and both are within twenty cubits [from the ground]. 
‘And sometimes the upper one is valid and the lower one is invalid’. In what circumstances? When in both of them the shade is more than the sun, and the upper one is within twenty cubits.
This is obvious!
The statement: "the lower one is valid and the upper one is invalid" was necessary. 
For what might you have said: we should invalidate [the lower sukkah] as a preventive measure lest one also joins invalid skhakh with valid skhakh, therefore it teaches us [that it is valid]. How much [space] should there be between [the roof of] one sukkah and that of the other to invalidate the lower one? 
R. Huna replied: 
A handbreadth since we find a handbreadth [prescribed as the minimum size] with regard to overshadowing in cases of uncleanliness,
as we have learned:
[A space of] one handbreadth square and one handbreadth high acts as a carrier of uncleanliness and as an interposition to it,
but if it is less than one handbreadth high it neither conveys nor interposes.
R. Hisda and Rabbah son of R. Huna say:
Four [handbreadths], since we do not find a place of any [legal] importance to be less than four [handbreadths]. And Shmuel says,
 Ten [handbreadths]. 
What is the reason of Shmuel? As its validity, so is its invalidity. 
Just as its validity [is effected by a height of] ten handbreadths, so is its invalidity [effected by] ten handbreadths
We have learned: R. Judah said:
if there are no occupants in the upper one, the lower one is valid.
What does it mean ‘there are no occupants’?
If we say, actual occupants, are then occupants [it could be objected] a determining factor? 
Rather we must say that ‘there are no occupants' means that the Sukkah is unsuitable for occupation?
How so? Because it is less than ten handbreadths high. We could therefore infer that the first opinion [in the Mishnah] holds that even if it is unsuitable for occupation it is still invalid?
When R. Dimi came he said: In the West they say
if the lower one cannot bear the weight of the bolsters and the cushions of the upper one, the lower one is valid.
This implies [does it not] that the first opinion holds that even if the lower one is not able to bear their weight, it is still invalid? 
The difference between them is where it can bear the weight with difficulty.
Mishnah. If he spread a sheet over it because of the sun or beneath it because of falling [leaves]; Or if he spread [a sheet] over the frame of a four-post bed, [the sukkah] is invalid. But he may spread it over the frame of a two-post bed.
Gemara. R. Hisda stated:
 [Our mishnah] speaks only [of a sheet spread] because of falling [leaves], but if [it was spread] in order to beautify [the sukkah], it is valid
But is not this obvious! For did we not learn in the mishnah, "because of falling [leaves]?
One might have said that the law is the same even [where the sheet was intended] to beautify [the sukkah] and that the reason why it was stated,
because of falling [leaves], is that he mentions what is the common practice, therefore he [R. Hisda] teaches us this.
Can we say that the following supports [R. Hisda's view]: 
If he covered it according to the rule, and adorned it with embroidered hangings and sheets, and hung in it nuts, almonds, peaches, pomegranates, bunches of grapes, wreaths of ears of corn, [vials of] wine, oil or fine flour, it is forbidden to make use of them

Daf 10b

until the conclusion of the last day of the Festival [of Sukkot],
 but if he expressed a condition about them, all depends on [the terms of] his condition?
No! It is possible [that the statement was made with reference to sheets] at the side [of the Sukkah].
It was stated: The decorations of a Sukkah do not diminish [the height of] the Sukkah.
R. Ashi said:
But at the side, they do diminish [the size of a Sukkah].
Minyamin, the servant of R. Ashi, had his shirt soaked in water, and he spread it out on their Sukkah. 
R. Ashi said to him,
 ‘Remove it, lest they say that it is permissible to use as a covering something which is susceptible to impurity.
‘But can they not see that it is wet?’
‘I mean [the first answered] when it is dry.'
It was stated: The decorations of a Sukkah which are removed four [handbreadths from the skhakh]
R. Nahman declares them valid, 
 valid, And R. Hisda and Rabbah son of R. Huna declare them
 invalid.
R. Hisda and Rabbah son of R. Huna once came to the house of the exilarch, And R. Nahman sheltered them in a Sukkah whose decorations were separated four handbreadths [from the skhakh]. They were silent and they didn't say a word to him.
 He said to them,
‘Have our rabbis retracted their teaching’? 
They answered him:
We are messengers performing a mitzvah, and [therefore] we are free from the obligation of the Sukkah.
Rav Judah said in the name of Shmuel,
It is permissible to sleep in a canopied bed in a Sukkah, even though it has a flat roof, provided it is not ten [handbreadths] high.
Come and hear: 
He who sleeps in a canopied bed in a Sukkah has not fulfilled his obligation?
Here we are dealing with a case of one that was ten [handbreadths] high.
It was objected:
He who sleeps under the bed in a Sukkah has not fulfilled his obligation?
But, surely, Samuel has explained that [this refers to] a bed ten [handbreadths] high.
Come and hear:
or if he spread [a sheet] over the frame of a four-post bed, [the sukkah] is invalid?
There also it is a case where they are ten [handbreadths] high
But surely, it was not taught in this way, for it has been taught:
Naklitin [means a frame with] two [poles], and kinofot [means a frame with] four [poles]; 
If one spread a sheet over the frame of kinofot it is invalid, if over naklitin, it is valid, provided that the naklitin are not ten [handbreadths] high above the bed. 
This implies that kinofot [are invalid] even if they are less than ten [handbreadths high]?
Kinofoth are different, since they are permanent.
But, behold the case of one Sukkah above another, which is also permanent; and Shmuel nevertheless said,
‘As its validity so is its invalidity’?
They said: 
In the latter case, [when it is a question] of invalidating a Sukkah, [the upper one must be ten [handbreadths] high, but here, [where it is a question] of making a tent, even less than ten [handbreadths suffices] also to constitute a tent.
R. Tahlifa b. Avimi said in the name of Shmuel:
He who sleeps naked in a canopied bed, may put his head out of the canopied bed and read the Shema.
It was objected:
 He who sleeps in a canopied bed naked may not put his head out of it and read the Shema?
The latter refers to a case where [the canopy] was ten [handbreadths] high. 
This stands to reason also, since it was stated in the final clause
To what can it be compared? To a man standing naked in a house, in which case he may not put his head out of the window and read the Shema’.
Learn from this.

Daf 11a

But as to a house, even though it is not ten [handbreadths] high, since it is permanent it constitutes a valid tent, for it is no worse than the frame of a four-post bed. 
Another version: Rav Judah said in the name of Shmuel:
It is permitted to sleep in a bridal-bed in a Sukkah, since it has no roof, even though it is ten [handbreadths] high
It was objected:
He who sleeps in a canopied bed in a Sukkah has not fulfilled his obligations?
Here we are dealing with the case of one which has a roof.
Come and hear: 
Naklitin [means a frame with] two [poles]; kinofot [means a frame with] four [poles], 
if he spread a canopy over the frame of kinofot it is invalid, over that of naklitin it is valid, provided that the naklitin are not ten [handbreadths] high above the bed. 
But if they are ten [handbreadths] high above the bed, it is invalid, [is it not] even though it has no roof?
Naklitin are different, since they are permanent. 
If they are permanent, why are they not [subject to the same law as] kinofoth?
As compared to kinofot they are not [considered] permanent, but compared to the bridal-bed they are [considered] permanent.
Rabbah bar R. Huna expounded,
It is permitted to sleep in a canopied bed [in a Sukkah] even though it has a roof and even though it is ten [handbreadths] high
According to whom [does he hold]? According to R. Judah who said
 that a temporary tent cannot nullify a permanent, tent
as we have learned: R. Judah said, 
We were accustomed to sleep under a bed in the presence of the elders.
Why then does he not say,
 "the halachah is according to R. Judah?
If he had said, "the halachah is according to R. Judah," I might have presumed
that this applies only to a bed which is made [to be slept] upon, but not to a canopied bed which, is made [to be slept] within, hence he teaches us
that the reason of R. Judah is that a temporary tent cannot nullify a permanent one, no matter whether it be an ordinary bed or a canopied bed.
If he trained a vine or a gourd or ivy over [the sukkah] and put skhakh on top of it, it is not valid
But if the skhakh is more than them, or if he cut them, it is valid. 
This is the general rule:
 whatever is susceptible to [ritual] impurity and does not grow from the ground may not be used for skhakh,
but whatever is not susceptible to [ritual] impurity and does grow from ground soil may be used for skhakh.
GEMARA. R. Joseph sat before R. Huna, and he sat and he stated:
 "Or if he cut them it is valid.
And Rav said:
He must shake them. 
R. Huna said to him:
That has been said by Shmuel! 
R. Joseph turned away his face [in annoyance] and retorted,
Did I say to you that Shmuel did not say it?
Rav said it and Shmuel also said it.
R. Huna said back to him:
This is what I meant to say to you: that, Shmuel said it, and not Rav, for Rav declares it valid [without shaking],
As in the case of R. Amram the Pious who attached fringes to the aprons of the women of his house. He hung them but he did not cut off the ends of the threads. 
When he came before R. Hiyya b. Ashi the latter said to him:
Thus said Rav, [In such a case the threads] may be cut and they are valid. 
Thus it is obvious that
their cutting is considered their making, so too here,
their cutting is considered their making.
But does Shmuel hold that we do not say that their cutting is their making?
But didn't Shmuel in fact teach in the name of R. Hiyya, 
 If one attached [tzitzit] to two corners at one time and then cut the ends of these threads, the tzitzit are valid
Does not this ,mean that he first knotted them and then cut them?
No, he cut them first and afterwards knotted them. 
If he cut them first and then knotted them,
why mention it? 

Daf 11b

One might have thought that it was necessary to insert the threads in one corner at a time, which he did not do this, therefore he taught us [that this is not so].
It was objected:
If he hung them and did not cut their ends, they are invalid.
Does not this mean invalid for ever,and is thus a refutation of Rav?
[No!] Rav can answer: What is the meaning of ‘invalid’? 
Invalid until they are cut.
Shmuel, however, says: 
They are invalid forever.
 And so said Levi:
They are invalid forever. And so said R. Matanah in the name of Smuel:
They are invalid forever
Another version: R. Matanah said:
Such an incident happened to me, and when I came before Shmuel he told me:
They are invalid forever.
They objected: 
If he inserted them and then cut their ends, they are invalid.
And it was also taught concerning a Sukkah:
(Deuteronomy 15:13) "You shall make" but not from that which is already made.
From here they said:
 If one trained a vine or a gourd or ivy [over the walls of a sukkah] and then covered them with skhakh it is invalid.
How so?
If you say that it is a case where one did not cut them, why did he give the reason ‘"You shall make" but not from that which is already made’?
Let him rather give the reason that they are joined to the ground? 
Consequently it must be a case where he cut them, and yet it is taught that they are invalid. Learn from this that we do not say that their cutting is their making. And this is a refutation of Rav?
Rav could answer that
here we are dealing with a case where he pulled them [from the trunk] so that their ‘making’ is not apparent.
In any case, [the baraita] "he inserted them and then cut their ends" is a difficulty against Rav?
It is a difficulty.
Can we say that [their dispute matches the dispute of] the following tannaim?:
 If one transgressed and plucked them, [the hadas is] invalid, the words of R. Shimon b. Yehozadak. But the Sages declare it valid. 
They thought 
that everyone agrees that a lulav must be tied together, and that we deduce [the law of] lulav from that of Sukkah, for it is written concerning the sukkah "You shall make" -- but not from what which is already made. 
Do they [then] not dispute this principle? That the one who declared it valid is of the opinion that 
with regard to the Sukkah we say that ‘their cutting is their making', and[therefore] with regard to lulav we also say that their plucking is their making; 
while the one who declares it invalid is of the opinion that
with regard to the Sukkah we do not say that ‘their cutting is their making, and [therefore] with regard to lulav also we do not say that their plucking is their making?
No! Everyone agrees that with regard to the Sukkah we do not say that their cutting is their making, but here they differ on the principle whether we deduce the law of lulav from that of Sukkah. 
The one who declares it valid is of the opinion
that we do not deduce lulav from Sukkah, while the one who declares it invalid says 
that we do deduce lulav from sukkah.
And if you wish you may say hat if we were of the opinion that the [components of the] lulav must be tied together, [we must admit that] all agree that we do deduce the law of lulav from that of Sukkah. 
But here they dispute on the following: One Master holds the opinion that
it must be tied together while the other holds that
it need not be tied together; 
and their dispute is the same as that of the following tannaim as it has been taught: 
A lulav, whether [its components] be tied together or not, is valid.
R. Judah says:
If tied together it is valid, if not, it is invalid.
What is the reason of R. Judah?
He deduces the word ‘take’ from the word ‘take’ mentioned in connection with the bundle of hyssop. It is written there, "And you shall take abundle of hyssop," (Exodus 12:22) and it is written here, "And you shall take you on the first day" (Leviticus 23:40). Just as there it was taken in a ‘bundle, so here also it must be taken in a bundle. 
And the rabbis?
They do not deduce ‘take’ from ‘take’.
According to whom is that which has been taught:
It is a mitzvah to tie [the components of] the lulav together, but if one did not tie them, it is [still] valid? 
If it is according to R. Judah, why is it valid if one does not tie them.
and if it is according to the Sages, why is it ‘mitzvah'?
It is in fact according to the Rabbis, but [it is a mitzvah] since it is written, "This is my God and I will adorn Him" (Exodus 15:2) be adorned before Him in [the due performance of] religious duties.
This is the general rule: whatever is susceptible to [ritual] uncleanliness etc
How do we know this?
 Resh Lakish said:
Scripture says, "And there went up a mist from the earth" (Genesis 2:6) just as a mist is a thing that is not susceptible to [ritual] uncleanliness and originates from the soil, so must [the covering of] the Sukkah [consist of] a thing that is not susceptible to [ritual] uncleanliness, and grow from the soil.
That is satisfactory according to the one who says that [the sukkot of the wilderness were] clouds of glory, but according to the one who says [the Israelites] made for themselves real sukkot, what can one say?
For it has been taught:
"For I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths" (Leviticus 23:43): These were clouds of glory, the words of R. Eliezer. 
R. Akiva says: They made for themselves real sukkot.
Now this is satisfactory according to R. Eliezer, but according to R. Akiva, what can one say? 
When R. Dimi came he said in the name of R. Yohanan,
Scripture says, "The Festival [hag] of Sukkoth you shall make for yourselves. The Sukkah is thus compared to the Festival [offering]. Just as the Festival offering is a thing which is not susceptible to [ritual] uncleanliness and grows from the soil, so the Sukkah must be unsusceptible to [ritual] uncleanliness and grow from the soil. 

Daf 12a

But just as the festival offering is a live animal so the Sukkah must be [of something which is] alive.
When Ravin came, he said in the name of R. Yohanan:
Scripture says, "When you gather in from your threshingfloor and your winepress" (Deuteronomy 16:13). The verse thus speaks of the waste from the threshing-floor and the waste from the wine-press. But perhaps it means the actual threshing-floor product and the actual wine-press product?
R. Zera answered: 
It is written winepress and it is impossible to cover the Sukkah with this!
R. Yirmiyah objected:
 But perhaps it means the solidified wine that comes from Senir, which resembles fig-cakes?
R. Zera said:
We had something in our hands, and R. Yirmiyah came and cast an axe at it
R. Ashi replied,
 ‘From your threshing-floor’, but not the threshing-floor produce itself, "from your wine-press’, but not the wine-press produce itself. 
R. Hisda said: [The law is learned] from here:
"Go out to the mountain and fetch olive-branches, and branches of the oily tree, and myrtle-branches and palm-branches, and branches of thick trees" (Nehemiah 8:15).
Are not myrtle-branches, the same as branches of thick trees? 
R. Hisda said:
The wild myrtle [were to be fetched] for the Sukkah, while the branches of thick trees, for the lulav.
Bundles of straw, bundles of wood, and bundles of brushwood—one may not use them as skhakh. But all of them, if he untied them, are valid. And they are all valid for the walls.
GEMARA. R. Yaakov said:
I heard from R. Yohanan [the explanation of] two things,
this one, and the following:
If one hollows out a haystack to make of it a sukkah, it is not a valid sukkah. 
The reason for one of them is a decree lest one make his sukkah into a storehouse, and the reason for the other is, "'You shall make’, [implying] but not from that which is made;" but I do not remember which of them is on account of a ‘store-house’, and which on account of "'you shalt make' but not from that which is made."
R. Yirmiyah said:
Let us see:
R. Hiyya b. Abba said in the name of R. Yohanan:
Why did they say that bundles of straw, bundles of wood, and bundles of brushwood may not serve as skhakh? Because it may happen that a man returns in the evening from the field with his bundle on his shoulder, and he raises it up and places it on his sukkah to dry it, and then he might decide to leave it there as a skhakh, but the Torah said, "You shall make," [which implies], but not from that which is made.
Now since this is a decree lest one use his store-house [as a Sukkah] the other must have been forbidden on the ground of ‘you shall make’ [which implies], but not from that which is made.
And R. Yaakov? He had not heard that [statement] of R. Hiyya b. Abba.
R. Ashi said:
Are then bundles of straw, bundles of wood and bundles of brushwood forbidden only because of the possible use of a store-house and not because of, "You shall make [which implies], but not from that which is made,"
and is the hollowing out of a haystack forbidden only because of the "You shall make which implies but not from that which is made," and not because of the possible use of a store-house?
And R. Yohanan could say to you
that here where it states, "One may not use them as skhakh" it means that only at the outset it is invalid, 

Daf 12b

it is invalid, because of the possible use of a storehouse, but according to Toraitic law it is valid;
While in the other case where it is stated "it is not a sukkah," it implies that even when he has made it, it is not a sukkah, even from the Torah. 
Rav Judah said in the name of Rav: If one covered a Sukkah with male arrow-shafts, it is valid; with female arrow shafts, it is invalid.
‘With male arrow-shafts it is valid’;
but is not this obvious? 
I might have said that these should be forbidden on account of female ones,  therefore he teaches us [that they are not forbidden].
‘With female shafts, it is invalid’, is not this obvious? —
I might have said
that a receptacle which is made to be [permanently] filled up is not regarded as a receptacle, therefore he informs us [that it is].
Rabbah b. Bar Hana said in the name of R. Yohanan:
‘If one covered a Sukkah with flax-stalks that had been soaked and baked, it is invalid; with flax stalks in their natural state it is valid; with flax-stalks in an intermediate stage of preparation, I do not know [whether it is valid or not]’. 
But as to what constitutes an intermediate stage, I do not know whether if it has been pounded and not combed it is regarded as in an intermediate stage, but if it has been soaked and not pounded it is regarded as being in its natural state, or perhaps, 
even if it has been soaked but not pounded, it is also regarded as being in an intermediate stage.
Rav Judah ruled: One may use fern or wormwood as skhakh. 
Abaye ruled:
 One may use fern as skhakh, but not wormwood. 
What is the reason? 

Daf 13a

Since they give an unpleasant odor, one might leave [the Sukkah] and depart.
R. Hanan b. Rava said:
Izma and hegeh (two types of prickly shrubs) may be used as skhakh.
Abaye said:
Izma may be used, but not hegeh. 
What is the reason? Since their leaves fall off, one might leave the Sukkah and depart. 
R. Gidal said in the name of Rav:
 The forked portion of a palm tree may be used as skhakh, even though [the branches] are joined together, [since] a natural joining is not considered a joining;
and even if one later joined them [the skhakh is valid, since] joining of one thing [to itself] is not considered a joining.
R. Hisda said in the name of Ravina b. Shila:
Forked reeds may be used as skhakh even though they are joined, [since] a natural joining is not considered a joining; and even though one later joins them, the joining of one thing [to itself] not considered as a proper joining.
It was also taught in a baraita:
Reeds and forked reeds may be used as skhakh. As to reeds, this is obvious? — 
Say:
Forked reeds may be used as a Sukkah-covering.
R. Hisda [further] stated in the name of Ravina b. Shila:
These "bitter herbs of the marsh" one can fulfill one's obligation with them on Pesah.
It was objected:
Hyssop but not Greek hyssop, or blue hyssop, or wild hyssop, or Roman hyssop or any kind of hyssop which has an accompanying name?
Abaye said:
Whatever had different names prior to the giving of the Torah, and yet the Torah made specific mention of the general name [the intention is to exclude such of the species which] have special names.
But these did not have different names before the giving of the Torah at all.
Rava answered:
Their ordinary name is really ‘marror", but they are called ‘marror of the marsh’, because they are found in marshes.
R. Hisda said:
The bundling of one thing [to itself] is not considered bundling; of three things, it is considered bundling; of two, there is a dispute between R. Yose and the rabbis, 
 as we have learned:
The mitzvah of the hyssop: it should have three stalks bearing three buds. Rabbi Yose says: 
the mitzvah of the hyssop is that it should have three stalks, and on them three buds, but its remnants need only have two, while its stumps may be of the smallest size.
Now we should assume that since
its remnants [are valid] with two, at the outset also two are valid, and that the reason he teaches three is to indicate what is the most proper observance of the commandment
And since R. Yose requires three only for the most proper observance of the commandment according to the rabbis three are indispensable.
But has it not been taught: R. Yose says:
If at the outset a bunch of hyssop has only two stalks or if its remnants consist of one, it is invalid, since a bunch is not valid unless at the outset it contains three and its remnants are no less than two?
Reverse [the assumption]: According to R. Yose three are indispensable, according to the rabbis three are required only for the proper observance of the commandment.
So it has also been taught:
 If a bunch of hyssop contains two stalks at the outset or if its remnant consists of one it is valid; it is not invalid unless at the outset or when it is a remnant it consists of one. 
But is a remnant of one invalid?
Have you not [just] said that a remnant of one is valid?


Daf 13b

Say rather: 
Unless at the outset, [it contains] no more than the number permitted for its remnant, one.
Meremar expounded:
The bundles of [twigs] made in Sura are valid as skhakh. Although [the seller] binds them together he does so merely to facilitate their counting.
R. Abba said:
These cone-shaped bundles of willows, as soon as the top-knots are untied they are valid [as skhakh].
But are they not still tied at the bottom?
R. Papa answered,
 [This is a case] where he loosens them. 
R. Huna the son of R. Joshua said:
one can even say that [it is valid even if] he does not loosen them, since a binding which is not made to be carried is not considered a binding.
R. Abba said in the name of Shmuel:
Herbs concerning which the sages said that a person fulfills with them his obligation on Pesah, convey ritual defilement, do not act as an interposition to ritual defilement and invalidate a sukkah in the same manner as an air space
What is the reason? — Since when they wither they crumble and fall, they are regarded as though they were not there
R. Abba further said in the name of R. Huna:
He who harvests grapes for the vat, does not render their "handles" [stalks] susceptible to [ritual] uncleanliness; 
While R. Menashia b. Gada said in the name of R. Huna:
He who harvests [ears of grain] for skhakh does not render their handles susceptible to uncleanliness. 
The one that said this with regard to harvesting [grain] certainly holds it with regard to harvesting grapes, since one does not desire [any stalks] lest they suck up one's wine; 
But the one that said this with regard to harvesting grapes, that he does not render their stalks susceptible to uncleanliness, holds that the harvesting [ears of grain] does render them susceptible since one is pleased to use [the ears] for the skhakh in order that [the grains] be not scattered.
Shall we say that the [ruling of] R. Menashya b. Gada is a dispute between tannas? For it has been taught:
Boughs of fig-trees on which there are figs, branches of vines on which there are grapes, or straws on which there are ears of grain, palm-branches on which there are dates, all these, if the inedible part is greater than the edible are valid [for skhakh], otherwise, they are invalid. 
 ‘Others’ say, [they are not valid] 
unless the straw is more than both the ‘handle’ and the food. 
Isn't it this that they argue about:
 that one master holds the opinion
they render the handles susceptible to uncleanliness, while the other master holds the opinion
that they do not render the ‘handles’ susceptible to uncleanliness?
To R. Abba this is certainly a tannaitic dispute. But shall we say that it is also a tannaitic dispute according to R. Menashye bar Gada? 
All agree that
he who harvests grain for skhakh does not render the ‘handles’ susceptible to uncleanliness, but here we are dealing with a particular case where he harvests them for food, and then changed his mind [and used them] for skhakh.
But if he cut them for food, what is the reason [for the view] of the rabbis?
And if you will answer that the rabbis are of the opinion that
since he changed his mind about them [to use them] for skhakh, his original intention becomes annulled, [it may be objected], does then one's intention become annulled in such a case? Have we not learned: 
All vessels

Daf 14a

can be rendered susceptible to uncleanliness by intention, but cannot be rendered insusceptible except by an act of change,
since an act can annul a [prior] act or intention, while an intention cannot annul either a [previous] act or a [previous] intention.
And if you will say that
this refers only to vessels which are of importance but that ‘handles’ which are needed only as aids for the eating of the food, are made [susceptible to uncleanness] by intention and are also unmade by intention [it may be objected], 
But have we not learned:
The handles of all foodstuffs that are threshed in the threshing-floor are insusceptible to ritual uncleanliness, and R. Yose declares them susceptible?
It goes well according to the authority who says that ‘threshing’ here means loosening [the sheaves], but according to the authority who says that ‘threshing’ here really means ‘threshing’, what can one answer?
That in the previous case also, he actually threshed them.
If so, what is the reason of the ‘others’?
They hold the same opinion as R. Yose,
as we have learned,
R. Yose declares them susceptible to uncleanness.
What is this [comparison]? 
One can understand there the reason of R. Yose, that [the stalks] have a use according to R. Shimon ben Lakish, as R. Shimon b. Lakish said, 
Since one can [the more easily] turn them with the pitchfork. But in this case, what use do they have?
It is usable to hold them by their stalks when he takes it apart.
[Reverting to] the main text:
‘The handles of all foodstuffs that have been threshed in the threshing-floor are insusceptible to uncleanness, and R. Yose declares them susceptible’.
What does it mean ‘threshed’? R. Yohanan says:
Actual threshing. R. Elazar says:
Untying the bundle. 
One can understand R. Elazar, who says that ‘threshing’ means untying the bundle, that this is the reason why R. Yose declares them susceptible to uncleanliness, But according to R. Yohanan who says that ‘threshing’ means actual threshing, why does R. Yose declare them susceptible to uncleanliness? R. Shimon b. Lakish answered:
Since he can [more easily] turn them with a pitch fork.
R. Elazar said,
Why are the prayers of the righteous likened to a pitchfork?
To teach thee that just as the pitchfork turns the grain from place to place in the threshing floor, so the prayers of the righteous turn the mind of the Holy One, blessed be He, from the attribute of harshness to that of mercy.
Mishnah: They may make skhakh out of wooden planks, the words or Rabbi Judah. Rabbi Meir forbids. 
If one places on top of [the sukkah] a plank four handbreadths wide, it is valid provided that he does not sleep under it.
Rav said:
The dispute is in a case of planks which are four [handbreadths wide], for R. Meir holds that this is forbidden as a decree against [the possible use of] an ordinary roof, while R. Judah holds that there is not a decree against [the possible use of] an ordinary roof.
But in the case of planks which are less than four handbreadths wide all agree that the Sukkah is valid. 
Shmuel however says that the dispute concerns planks
which are less than four [handbreadths wide], but if they are four [handbreadths wide], they are invalid according to all.
If they are ‘less than four’ and even less than three? But [in this case] are they not mere sticks?
R. Papa answered:
This is what he (Shmuel) means: If they are four [handbreadths wide] the sukkah is invalid according to all; If they are less than three, it is valid according to all. What is the reason? Since they are mere sticks.
Over what do they dispute? [Planks that are] from three to four [handbreadths wide]. 
 One master holds that
since there is not in them the minimum measure of a ‘place’ we do not decree against their use, and the other master holds the opinion that
since the law of lavud can no longer apply to them we do decree against their use. 
We learned: 
If one places over it a plank which is four handbreadths wide, it is valid, provided that he does not sleep under it.
Now it is well according to Samuel who says that the dispute is where there are not four [handbreadths] but where there are four, all agree that it is invalid; for this reason he must not sleep under it.
But according to Rav who says that the dispute is where there are four [handbreadths] but where there are less than four all agree that it is valid, why, according to R. Judah, may he not sleep under it?
Do you then think that this statement is according to all? The concluding statement agrees in fact with R. Meir [only].
Come and hear:
Two sheets combine,

Daf 14b

two boards do not combine.
 R. Meir says:
Boards also are like sheets.
It is well according to Samuel who says that the dispute is where there are not four [handbreadths], but where there are four handbreadths all agree that it is invalid, 
[since it may be explained;] What does ‘combine’ mean? That they combine to make four [handbreadths].
But according to Rav, who says that their dispute is where there are four [handbreadths], but where there are not four handbreadths all agree that it is valid,
 how is it to be explained?
If there are four [handbreadths] why do they need to combine;
 if there are not, why [is it invalid]? 
Are they not mere sticks?
Indeed [it is a case] where there are four handbreadths, and what [is meant by] "combine" they combine to form four cubits at the side
Another version:
 goes well according to Shmuel, who says that the dispute is where there are not four [handbreadths], but where there are four, all agree that it is invalid. What is meant by ‘combine’? That they combine to form four cubits at the side. 
But according to Rav it goes well according to R. Meir, since what is meant by ‘combine’ may be that they combine to form four cubits at the side, but according to R. Judah, who says that even if there are four [handbreadths] the Sukkah is valid, what could be the meaning of ‘they do not combine’? 
Are they not like mere sticks?
Since R. Meir said ‘they do combine’, R. Judah said ‘they do not combine’. 
It has been taught in agreement with Rav, and it has been taught in agreement with Samuel. 
It has been taught in agreement with Rav:
If he covered the sukkah with planks of cedar which are not four [handbreadths wide], it is valid according to all. If they have four [handbreadths]: R. Meir declares it invalid and R. Judah valid. 
R. Judah said:
It happened in a time of danger that we brought planks which were four [handbreadths wide] and we laid them over a balcony and sat under them.
They said to him,
They said to him
A time of danger is no proof. 
It has been taught in agreement with Shmuel
If one covered the Sukkah with planks of cedar which are four [handbreadths wide] it is invalid according to all; if they do not have not four [handbreadths]: R. Meir declares it invalid and R. Judah valid. But R. Meir admits that if there is a space of one plank between every two planks, one may place by-product (valid for skhakh) between them and the Sukkah is valid.
And R. Judah agrees that if he placed on it a plank four handbreadths wide, [although] the Sukkah is valid, a man may not sleep under it, and if he sleeps beneath it he has not fulfilled his obligation
It was stated: If he placed the planks on their sides:
R. Huna declared
it invalid, and R. Hisda and Rabbah son of R. Huna declared
it valid.
R. Nahman once came to Sura. R. Hisda and Rabbah son of R. Huna came in to him and asked: 
If he placed them on their sides, what is the law? 
He said to them:
It is invalid, since they are regarded as metal spits. 
R. Huna said to them:
Did I not tell you, say like me?
They answered him:
Did then the Master give us a reason and we did not accept it from him? 
He said to them: Did you ask me for a reason and I would not give you?
Can we say that the following provides support for his view: 
If [the sukkah] cannot contain his head, the major part of his body and his table, or if a breach has been made in it large enough for a kid to jump in headlong, or if he placed on it a plank four handbreadths wide, even if he puts in three handbreadths, it is invalid.
 How so?
Surely that he placed them on their sides?
No! Here we are dealing with a case where he placed it above the entrance of the sukkah, with three [of the four handbreadths] within and one protruding outside, in which case it is considered as a waste (skhakh) protruding from the Sukkah, and every waste (skhakh) protruding from a Sukkah is regarded as [part of the] Sukkah.

Daf 15a

Mishnah: A [wooden] roof that has no plastering: Rabbi Judah says:
Bet Shammai say that
he should loosen [the planks] and remove one from between each two. And Bet Hillel say
he should either loosen [the planks] or remove one from between two.
Rabbi Meir says, 
he removes one from between two, but he does not loosen [the planks].
GEMARA. It is well according to Bet Hillel; their reason is that ‘You shall make’, but not from that which is [already] made. If he loosens [the planks] he performs an action, and if he removes one from between two he performs an action. But what is the reason of Beth Shammai?
If it is ‘You shall make’ but not from that which is [already] made, one act only should be sufficient; if it is because of a decree lest one use ordinary roofing, it should suffice if he removes one from between two?
Indeed it is because of a decree lest one use ordinary roofing,
and this is what they say: Even although he loosens them, if he removes one from between two, it is [valid], otherwise it is not.
If so, read the concluding [part:] 
R. Meir ruled, he should remove one from between two, but not loosen.
Is not R. Meir's view thus identical with that of Beth Shammai?
This is what he (R. Meir) means:
Bet Shammai and Beth Hillel did not dispute on this point.
What [then] does [the Mishnah] teach us? That R. Meir holds that there is decree lest the sukkah look like ordinary roofing, while R. Judah holds that there is no such decree? 
But have they not already disputed this, 
 as we have learned: 
Planks may be used for skhakh, the words of R. Judah; R. Meir forbids them.
R. Hiyya b. Abba answered in the name of R. Yohanan,
The former mishnah deals with planed boards and they forbade them as a decree lest he comes to use vessels
But according to Rav Judah who said in the name of Rav: 
 ‘If he covered the sukkah with plain arrowshafts, it is valid; with bored arrow-shafts, it is invalid’, and he does not decree against plain shafts on account of [the possible use of] bored ones;
here also we should not restrict planed boards on account of [the possible use of] vessels?
Rather to say that the dispute in the former [mishnah] is on the question whether a we decree against something [that might lead to] the possible use of an ordinary roofing and that the dispute in the latter mishnah is also on the same question; but why should they dispute the same question twice? 
The latter [mishnah] is what R. Judah said to R. Meir:
‘Why do you forbid planks? As a decree against [the possible use of] an ordinary roofing? But it is Beth Shammai only who hold this opinion while Beth Hillel do not decree [against planks]. 
To this R. Meir said
that Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel do not dispute this point at all.
This is correct according to Rav who says that the dispute is where the planks are four [handbreadths wide], since in such a case R. Meir holds that we decree lest one come to use ordinary roofing while R. Judah says we don't decree lest one use ordinary roofing
But according to Shmuel, who says that the dispute is where the planks are not four [handbreadths wide], but that where they are four handbreadths wide all agree that it is invalid, on what principle do they dispute in the latter [Mishnah]? 
They dispute on [the question of] the annulment of a roof. One master holds the opinion that 
by this means it becomes annulled, while the other master holds the opinion that
by this means it does not become annulled. 
Mishnah One who roofs his sukkah with iron spits or with bedposts, if the space between them equals them, it is valid.
One who hollows out a haystack to make for himself a sukkah, it is not a valid sukkah.
Gemara: Can we say that this is a refutation of R. Huna, the son of R. Joshua,
 since it was stated:
If the breach is equal to that which is standing, R. Papa says 
it is permitted, and R. Huna the son of R. Joshua says
it is forbidden?
R. Huna the son of R. Joshua can answer,
‘What is meant by equals them? That it can easily pass through them.

Daf 15b

But is it not possible to measure them exactly’?
R. Ammi answered:
This is a case where he makes it larger. 
Rava said: 
one can even say that he does not make it larger, but if they were placed as the web, he places [the valid covering] as the woof; if as the woof, he places them as the web.
Or the long boards of a bed.
Can we say that this supports [a statement of] R. Ammi b. Tavyomi,
 for R. Ammi b. Tavyomi said:
If he covered the Sukkah with worn out vessels it is invalid? 
[No,] as R. Hanan said in the name of Rabbi,
‘With the long board and two legs, or with the short board and two legs’, 
so here also
it may refer to the long board and two legs, or the short board and two legs
it may refer to the long board and two legs, or the short board and two legs

Daf 16a

A bed can become unclean [only] when it is assembled and be rendered clean only when it is assembled, the words of R. Eliezer, 
 but the sages say
it can become unclean when it is in parts and become clean when in parts. 
What are [these parts]?
 — R. Hanan said in the name of Rabbi, 
The long board and two legs or the short board and two legs. 
For what is it fit? For placing against a wall and sitting upon it, and for tying it with ropes.
[Reverting to] the main text: ‘R. Ammi b. Tavyomi said:
If he covered with discarded vessels it is invalid’. 
What are discarded vessels?
Abaye said,
Small strips of cloth less than three [handbreadths] square which are unfit to be used either by rich or by poor.
It has been taught in agreement with R. Ammi b. Tavyomi: 
Matting of rushes or straw, its remnants, even if diminished from the minimum measure, may not be used for skhakh.
A mat of reeds, a large one may be used for skhakh, a small one may not be used for skhakh. R. Eliezer said:
It too is susceptible to impurity and may not be used as skhakh.
If he hollows out a haystack:
R. Huna said:
This was taught only where there is not a hollow of one handbreadth [in height] extending to seven [handbreadths square], but if there is a hollow of one handbreadth extending to seven, it is a [valid] sukkah. 
It has also been taught in a baraita:
If he hollows out a haystack to make for himself a Sukkah, it is a [valid] Sukkah. 
But have we not learned, it is not a sukkah? Deduce, from it [that the explanation is] according to R. Huna. Deduce from it. 
Some put it in the form of a contradiction. 
We have learned:
if he hollows out a haystack to make for himself a sukkah, it is no sukkah. But has it not been taught that
it is [a valid] Sukkah?
R. Huna answered:
There is no difficulty,
the latter refers to where there is a hollow of a handbreadth extending to seven [handbreadths] while the former refers to where there is no hollow of a handbreadth extending to seven [handbreadths].
If he hangs walls down from above to below, if they are higher than three handbreadths from the ground, it is invalid. 
If he raises them from the bottom to the top, if they are ten handbreadths high, it is valid
Rabbi Yose says:
just as from the bottom to the top ten handbreadths [suffices] so from the top to the bottom ten handbreadths [suffice
Gemara. What do they argue about?
One master holds the opinion that
a hanging partition renders [the Sukkah] valid, and the other Master holds the opinion that a hanging partition does not render it valid.
We learned there
A cistern between two courtyards—they do not fill up from it on Shabbat, unless they made for it a partition ten handbreadths high, whether above, below or from its rim. 
Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: 

Daf 16b

Bet Shammai say: 
below, And Bet Hillel say: 
above. 
Rabbi Judah said:
the partition could not be more effective than the wall between the two courtyards.
Rabbah b. Bar Hana said in the name of R. Yohanan:
R. Judah spoke according to the view of R. Yose who said that
a hanging partition validates.
But in fact it is not so! Neither does R. Judah hold the opinion of R. Yose, nor does R. Yose hold the opinion of R. Judah. 
‘R. Judah does not hold the opinion of R. Yose’, for R.
Judah speaks only there with regard to the eruv of courtyards, which is of rabbinical origin, but here, with regard to the sukkah which is from the Torah, he does not [say so]. ‘Nor does R. Yose hold the opinion of R. Judah,’ for R. Yose speaks only here with regard to the Sukkah which is merely a positive commandment
but with regard to Shabbat, which is a prohibition punishable by stoning, he does not say so.
And if you will says with regard to
the incident which occurred at Tzippori, on whose authority was it done?
Not on the authority of R. Yose, but rather on that of R. Ishmael son of R. Yose.
What was this incident
 — That when R. Dimi came he said:
 It once happened that that they forgot to bring a Torah scroll before Shabbat. The next day, they spread out sheets over the pillars and brought the Torah scroll and read from it
Can it mean that they [really] spread them out? Where did they bring them from on Shabbat?
Rather
they found sheets [already] spread over the pillars, and therefore they brought the Torah scroll and read from it.
R. Hisda stated in the name of Abimi:
A matting slightly more than four handbreadths [wide] is permitted as a sukkah wall. 
How does one place it? — One suspends it in the middle less than three [handbreadths] from the ground and less than three from the top, and whatever [space] is less than three handbreadths is treated as lavud. 
But is not this obvious?
— One might have said that
we apply the law of lavud once, but we do not apply lavud twice [to the same wall], therefore he informed us of this.
It was objected:
A matting slightly more than seven [handbreadths] is permitted as a Sukkah wall!
That was taught with reference to a large Sukkah;
and what does it inform us? That walls may be suspended from above downwards in agreement with R. Yose.
R. Ammi said:
A board which is slightly more than four [handbreadths] wide is permitted for a sukkah wall when he places it less than three [handbreadths] from the the adjacent wall, 
since a space less than three [handbreadths] is treated as lavud
What does he inform us?
— He informs us this:
That the minimum extent of a small sukkah is seven [handbreadths].

Daf 17a

Mishnah. If one removed the skhakh three handbreadths from the walls, it is invalid. 
[A roof of] a house which was opened, and he placed skhakh over it: if there is a distance of four cubits from the wall to the covering, it is invalid. 
Similarly in the case of a courtyard which is surrounded by columns. 
A large sukkah which was surrounded with material which is invalid for skhakh, if there is a space of four cubits beneath it, it is invalid.
Gemara. Why are all these [rulings] needed?
It is necessary [to state them all]. For if he had only informed us of [the roof of] a house which had been opened, [one would have said that the validity applied to this case only] because the partitions are made for the house, but in the case of a courtyard which is surrounded by columns, where the partitions are not made for the walls are not made for the columns it does not apply.
And if he had informed us of those two, [one would have said that the validity applied to these cases only] because their skhakh is valid, but in the case of a large sukkah which is surrounded with a material which is invalid for a sukkah covering, since the skhakh itself is invalid, it does not apply [therefore it is] necessary [to mention all].
Rabbah stated:
I found the rabbis of the house of Rav sitting and saying,
‘an open air space invalidates if it is three [handbreadths wide]; an invalid covering invalidates if it is four [handbreadths wide]’, 
And I said to them: from where do you know that an air space of three [handbreadths] invalidates? From that which we learned:
if he distanced the skhakh three handbreadths from the walls, it is invalid. [But if so,] invalid skhakh too should not invalidate unless it extends to four cubits, since we have learned:
if [the roof of] a house is opened and he placed skhakh over it, if there is a distance of four cubits from the wall to the skhakh, it is invalid. 
And they said to me,
this is no evidence since Rav and Shmuel both say that
the reason it is valid is because [the roof is regarded as the continuation] of a ‘curved wall
And I said to them:
what [would the law be] if the invalid skhakh were less than four [handbreadths], with an air space of less than three [handbreadths]? It would be valid. 
And what if he filled in this space with metal spits? It would be invalid. Now should not an air-space which invalidates with three [handbreadths] be treated like invalid skhakh which only invalidates with four?
And they answered me,
If so, then even according to you, who says that invalid skhakh invalidates only if there are four cubits, how [would it be] if there was invalid skhakh of less than four cubits, and [next to it] an air space of less than three handbreadths? It would be valid. And if he filled in this space with metal spits? It would be invalid. Now [can it not similarly be argued] should not an air space which invalidates with three [handbreadths] be like the skhakh which invalidates [only] if there are four cubits?’
And I answered them, 
how so?
It is well according to me who says four cubits,

Daf 17b

because [in this case the validity of the sukkah depends on] whether there is the standard size or not, and there is not the standard size, for since their standard sizes are unequal, they do not combine; 
because [in this case the validity of the sukkah depends on] whether there is the standard size or not, and there is not the standard size, for since their standard sizes are unequal, they do not combine; 
Abaye said to him:
But also according to the master, while we can admit that their measures are unequal in a large sukkah, but in a small sukkah are they not equal?
He answered,
he reason there is not because the measures are equal, but because there is not the [minimum] size of a sukkah remaining. 
And in any case where the minimum measures are not equal they don't join together?
Have we not in fact learned:
a garment that is three [handbreadths] square, sacking four handbreadths square, leather five handbreadths square and matting six handbreadths square[are susceptible to uncleanness]. 
And it has been taught concerning this:
garments and sacking, sacking and leather, leather and matting combine with one another?
In that case the reason has been given, as Rabbi Shimon said:
"What is the reason? Since they are susceptible to uncleanliness if [a zav] sits on them, as we have learned:
if he cuts from any one of them a piece one handbreadth square, it is susceptible to uncleanliness’. 
if he cuts from any one of them a piece one handbreadth square, it is susceptible to uncleanliness’. 
Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish in the name of R. Yannai said,
it can be used as a patch for [the saddle of] a donkey.
In Sura they taught this passage in the above words; 
In Nehardea they taught [as follows]: Rav Judah said in the name of Shmuel: 
invalid skhakh in the middle [of the sukkah] invalidates if it is four [handbreadths wide]; at the side only if it is four cubits wide; 
While Rav says, 
whether in the middle or at the sides, [it invalidates] only if it is four cubits wide. 
We have learned:
if he placed over it a plank four hand breadths wide, it is valid. 
It is well according to Rav who says that whether in the middle or at the sides [the invalid covering must be no less than] four cubits [to invalidate it]; for this reason it is [here] valid;
but according to Shmuel who says that at the middle a width of four [handbreadths invalidates], why is it here valid?
Here what are we dealing with? When [the plank was placed at] the side.
Come and hear: 
two sheets combine, two boards do not combine.
R. Meir says,
boards are like sheets.
It is well according to that version which says that Rav says that ‘whether in the middle or at the sides [it invalidates only] if it is four cubits wide;’ What does it mean by ‘combine'? They combine to make four cubits.
But, according to the version which says that Rav says that, in the middle [even] four handbreadths [width of invalid skhakh] invalidates,
what kind of boards are we to imagine? If they are each four handbreadths wide, why do they need to combine?
And if they are each less than four handbreadths wide, they are mere sticks! 
This is indeed a case where they are each four handbreadths wide; and what does ‘combine’ mean? That they combine to make up four cubits at the side. 
Come and hear:
if he covered the sukkah with planks of cedarwood which are four [handbreadths wide], according to all it is invalid; 
If they are not four handbreadths: R. Meir disqualifies and R. Judah validates. 

Daf 18a

R. Meir admits that if there is the space of one plank between every two planks that one may place valid skhakh between them and it is valid.
It is well according to him who says that whether in the middle or at the sides it needs four cubits [of invalid covering to invalidate a sukkah], for this reason it is here valid; 
but according to him who says that in the middle four [handbreadths of invalid skhakh invalidate] why is it valid?
R. Huna the son of R. Joshua answered:
Here we are dealing with a sukkah which measures no more than a bare eight [cubits], and he places [alternately] plank and valid skhakh plank and valid skhakh, plank and valid skhakh on one side and [similarly] plank and valid skhakh, plank and valid skhakh, plank and valid skhakh on the other side, so that there are two sections of valid skhakh in the middle, and thus a valid sukkah is formed in the middle.
Abaye ruled:
An air space of three handbreadths in a large sukkah which is diminished with either sticks or spits is a [valid] diminution;
in a small Sukkah, with sticks it is a [valid] diminution, with spits an invalid one. 
This applies only to the side, 
but as regards the middle, R. Aha and Ravina differ. 
One says:
the rule of lavud applies in the middle, while the other says, 
the rule of lavud does not apply in the middle.
What is the reason of him who says that the rule of lavud applies in the middle?  — Because it has been taught:
If a beam protrudes from one wall but does not touch the opposite wall, and similarly in the case of two beams, one protruding from one wall and one from the other and not touching each other, if [the space between them is] less than three [handbreadths] it is unnecessary to provide another beam; if it is three [handbreadths] it is necessary to provide another beam. And [what does] the other [answer to this]?
— Beams are different [from a sukkah] since [they are only] a  measure.
What is the reason of the one who says that the rule of lavud is not applied in the middle? — Because we learned: 
 If a skylight in [the roof of] a house was of one handbreadth square, and there was an object of uncleanliness in the house, all the house is unclean, but what is directly below the skylight is clean. 
If the unclean object is directly below the skylight, the whole house is clean.
If the skylight was less than a handbreadth square, and there was an unclean object in the house, what is directly below the skylight is clean. If the unclean object is directly below the skylight, the whole house is clean.
And [what does] the other [say]?
The laws of uncleanliness differ [from those of sukkah] since they have a tradition about them.
R. Judah b. Ila'i expounded:
If [the roof of] a house is breached, and he placed skhakh over it, it is valid. 
R. Ishmael son of R. Jose said to him
Master, explain [your words]. 
Thus my father explained it: 
If there are four cubits it is invalid, if less than four cubits, it is valid.
R. Judah b. Ila'i expounded: 
abruma is permitted
R. Ishmael son of R. Yose said to him, 
 Master, explain [your words].
Thus said my father,
Those from such and such a place are forbidden, and from such and such a place are permitted. 
This is like that which Abaye said;
the tzahanta of Bab Nahara are permitted. 
What is the reason?
and an unclean fish, since it has no spinal cord, cannot exist therein, [it could be retorted that] we see that they do exist [in rivers with rapid currents]. 
Will you then say that it is because it has salt water, and ‘an unclean fish, since it has no scales, cannot exist [in salt water,
it could be retorted that] we see that they do exist? 
The reason in fact is that the muddy nature of this river does not allow unclean fish to breed in it. 
Ravina said:
But at the present time that the Etan river and the Gamda river flow into it and they are forbidden.
It was stated: If one placed skhakh over an exedra which has pillars, it is valid
If it has no pillars: Abaye declares 
it valid and Rava declares it invalid. 
Abaye declares it valid [since]

Daf 18b

 we say that 
the edge of the roof [of the exedra is regarded as though it] descends and fills up [the space].
While Raba says it is invalid,
since we do not say that the edge of the roof descends and fills up [the space]. 
Rava said to Abaye:
according to you who say that the edge of the roof [is regarded as though it] descends and fills in [the space, is a sukkah valid] even if the middle wall is missing?
.He answered him, 
In that case I agree with you [that the Sukkah is invalid] since it would be like an alley-way that is open on two opposite sides.
Shall we say that Abaye and Rava disagree on the same principle as that on which Rav and Shmuel differed for it was stated:
If an exedra was in a field:
Rav declares that it is permitted to carry [on Shabbat] over the whole extent of it, since we say that the edge of the roof descends and fills in the space;
While Samuel said that
 it is forbidden to carry in it except within four cubits, since we do not say that the edge of the roof descends and fills in [the space]?
No!] With regard to the opinion of Shmuel neither of them disagrees

Daf 19a

They only differ with regard to the opinion of Rav. 
Abaye agrees with Rav,
while Rava can say that
Rav ruled then only in that case, since the partitions are made for the exedra, but in the case here, since they are not made for this purpose [he would] not [rule thus].
We have learned:
similarly in the case of a courtyard which is surrounded with an exedra.
But why?
Should it not rather be assumed that the edge of the roof descends and fills in [the space]?
Rava explained according to Abaye that
this is a case where one made the beams level.
In Sura they taught these statements in the above form.
In Pumbedita they taught [it as follows]:
If a man placed skhakh over an exedra which has no pillars, it is invalid according to all. 
If it has pillars: Abaye declares it 
valid, while Rava declares 
it invalid. 
Abaye declares
it valid, since we apply the law of lavud.
Rava declares
it invalid, since we do not apply the law of lavud.
And the law is according to the former version.
R. Ashi found R. Kahana placing skhakh over an exedra which had no pillars
He said to him:
Does not the master hold the opinion which Rava stated,
that if it has pillars it is valid, but if it has no pillars it is invalid? 
He showed him [that a pillars] was visible within though level on the outside
or
visible from without, though level from within,
for it has been stated,
‘If it is visible from without and level from within, it is regarded as a valid sidepost’, and a side-post is in this respect like pillars
A Tanna taught:
kosher skhakh projecting from a Sukkah is regarded as the Sukkah. 
What is meant by ‘kosher skhakh projecting from a Sukkah’? 
‘Ulla said,
Sticks projecting beyond the back of the Sukkah.
But do we not need three walls?
[This refers to a case] where there were [three walls]. 
But do we not need the size prescribed as a minimum for the validity of a Sukkah?
But do we not need the size prescribed as a minimum for the validity of a Sukkah?
But do we not need that the shade should exceed the sun?
[This refers to] where there was [more shade than sun]. 
If so, what does it teach us? 
One might have said that
since they were made for the inside but not for the outside it is not [valid]  therefore he informs us [that it is valid].
Rabbah and R. Joseph both stated:
This refers to sticks projecting in front of a Sukkah, one wall of which continues with them. 
What might one have said? That it does not contain the prescribed minimum for the validity of a Sukkah, therefore he informs us [that it is valid].
Rabbah b. Bar Hana said in the name of R. Yohanan:
it was necessary only in the case of a Sukkah, most of which has more shade than sun, while a minor part of it has more sun than shade. 
What might one have said?
That this small portion invalidates it, therefore he informs us [that it does not]. 
What then is meant by ‘going out’? [It means] going out from the validity of a Sukkah.
R. Oshaia said:
This is necessary only in the case of a small sukkah which has invalid skhakh to an extent of less than three [handbreadths].
And what is meant by ‘going out’? Going out from the laws governing a Sukkah.
R. Hoshiah raised a difficulty:
Let it be regarded as no better than air space, does then air space of less than three [handbreadths] invalidate a small sukkah?
R. Abba answered him,
[The difference is that] in the former case it combines [with the rest of the Sukkah] and it is permitted to sleep under it; in the latter case it does not combine and it is forbidden to sleep under it.
But is there anything which itself is invalid and yet combines [with another thing to become valid]? 
R. Isaac b. Elyashiv answered, 
Yes!

Daf 19b

Fluid clay proves it;  it combines to make up forty seah, yet he who immerses in it has not undergone a proper immersion.
Mishnah: One who makes his sukkah like a cone-shaped hut or leans it against a wall: Rabbi Eliezer invalidates it since it has no roof, But the sages declare it valid.
GEMARA. It has been taught:
R. Eliezer agrees that if he raised it one handbreadth from the ground, or if he separated it one handbreadth from the wall, it is valid.
What is the reason of the rabbis? That the incline of a tent is like the tent itself.
Abaye found R. Joseph sleeping on a bridal bed in a Sukkah
He said to him
‘According to whom [do you act]? According to R. Eliezer? Do you then forsake the Rabbis and act according to R. Eliezer?’
He answered him,
‘In the baraita this is taught in the reverse, R. Eliezer declares it valid and the Sages declare it invalid.’ 
[Abaye then asked], ‘Do you forsake a Mishnah and act according to a baraita?’ 
— He answered him,
‘The Mishnah represents an individual opinion, 
as it has been taught,
If he makes his Sukkah like a cone-shaped hut, or leaned it against a wall R. Natan says that
R. Eliezer invalidates it because it has no roof while the Sages declare it valid.'
Mishnah: A large reed mat: if made for lying upon it is susceptible to [ritual] impurity and is invalid as skhakh. If made for skhakh, it may be used for skhakh and is not susceptible to uncleanliness. 
Rabbi Eliezer says:
whether small or large: If it was made for reclining upon, it is susceptible to uncleanliness and is invalid as skhakh; If made for a covering, it is valid as a skhakh and is not susceptible to uncleanliness.
GEMARA. [Is not our Mishnah] self-contradictory? It says,
if made for reclining upon is susceptible to [ritual] uncleanliness and is invalid as skhakh
The reason then is because it was made specifically for reclining upon, but if it was made without specific purpose, [it would be assumed that it was] for skhakh. 
And then it is taught:
if made for a covering it is valid as skhakh and is not susceptible to [ritual] uncleanliness. 
The reason then is because it was made specifically for a covering, but if it was made without specific purpose [it would be assumed that it was] made for reclining upon?
This is no difficulty. The former case refers to a large [mat], the latter to a small one. 
But read the latter portion [of the Mishnah].
R Rabbi Eliezer says: 
whether small or large: If it was made for reclining upon, it is susceptible to uncleanliness and is invalid as skhakh.
The reason is that he made it for reclining, but if made without a specific purpose it can be used as skhakh
But [again] read the later portion [of the Mishnah]
If made for a covering, it is valid as a skhakh and is not susceptible to uncleanliness. The reason then is that it was made specifically for covering, but if made without specific purpose, [it would be assumed that it was] for reclining upon?
Rather Rava said:
In the case of a large [mat] all agree that if made without specific purpose [it is assumed to be intended] for a covering. They only differ in the case of a small [mat].
The first Tanna holds that
ordinarily a small one is for reclining upon, and R. Eliezer holds
that ordinarily a small one is for a covering as well.

Daf 20a

And this is what was meant:
If a large mat of reeds is made specifically for reclining upon, it is susceptible to [ritual] uncleanliness and is invalid as skhakh. 
The reason is that it was made specifically for reclining upon, but ordinarily it is regarded as though it was made for a covering, and is valid as skhakh. 
A small [mat], if made for a covering, is valid as skhakh. The reason is that it was made specifically for covering, but ordinarily it is regarded as though made for reclining upon, and is invalid for a Sukkah-covering. [This is the view of the first Tanna]
And R. Eliezer comes to say that
whether it is small, or large, if made without specific purpose, it is valid as skhakh.
Abaye said to him,
If so, [instead of] R. Eliezer says, whether it is small or large, 
it ought to read, Whether it is large or small?
Furthermore,
is it not in fact with regard to a large mat that they are in dispute, and it is R. Eliezer who takes the stricter view, 
for it was taught:
A large mat of reeds is valid for skhakh. R. Eliezer says:
If it is not susceptible to [ritual] uncleanliness, it is valid for skhakh.
Rather R. Papa said: 
With regard to a small [mat], all agree that ordinarily it is intended for reclining upon. 
About what do they disagree? About a large one. 
The first Tanna is of the opinion that
ordinarily a large one is intended for a covering, while R. Eliezer is of the opinion that
ordinarily a large one is intended also for reclining.
And what is meant by ‘if it was made for reclining'? It is this that was meant: 
Ordinarily also its manufacture is assumed to be for the purpose of reclining upon unless one made it specifically for a covering.
Our rabbis taught: 
A mat of wicker or of straw: if large, is valid for skhakh, if small it is invalid for skhakh.
One of reeds or of helat, if plaited, is valid for a skhakh, if woven, it is invalid. 
R. Ishmael son of R. Yose said in the name of his father:
Both the one and the other, are valid for skhakh;
and R. Dosa also ruled according to his view.
We have learned elsewhere:
All [hotzlot] mats are [liable to become] impure by corpse impurity, the words of Rabbi Dosa. But the Sages say:
 [Also by] midras impurity. 
[Can it mean] to the uncleanliness of midras but not to that of a corpse!
But haven't we learned:
Whatever is susceptible to uncleanliness of midras is also susceptible to uncleanliness from a corpse?
Say rather
also to the uncleanliness of midras.
What is meant by "hotzlot"?
R. Abdimi b. Hamduri said
marzublei.
What is marzublei? 
R. Abba said,
Bags filled with foliage.
R. Shimon b. Lakish said:
Real mats
And Resh Lakish is consistent with his own view, since Resh Lakish said,
May I be atonement for R. Hiyya and his sons.
For in ancient times when the Torah was forgotten from Israel, Ezra came up from Babylon and established it. [Some of] it was again forgotten and Hillel the Babylonian came up and established it. Yet again was [some of] it forgotten, and R. Hiyya and his sons came up and established it
And thus said R. Hiyya and his sons:
R. Dosa and the Sages did not dispute about reed-mats of Usha, 

Daf 20b

that they are susceptible to [ritual] uncleanliness, or of Tiberias that they are not susceptible.
About what do they dispute? About those of other places. 
One Master is of the opinion that 
since they are not [as a rule] used for sitting upon, they are like those of Tiberias, and the Masters are of the opinion that 
since it sometimes happens that they are used for sitting upon, they are like those of ‘Usha
The Master said:
 ‘All reed mats are susceptible to corpse uncleanliness. These are the words of R. Dosa’. 
But was it not taught: 
‘And R. Dosa also said according to his words’?
-This is no difficulty. 
The former refers to one that has a rim, the latter to one that has no rim.
It was objected:
Mats of bamboo, of reed grass, of sackcloth or of goat's-hair are susceptible to corpse uncleanliness, the words of R. Dosa, 
But the sages say: they are also susceptible to midras uncleanliness. It goes well according to him who says [that hozlot means] ‘bags filled with foliage’, since those of bamboo and of reed-grass can be used for a basket fruit, while those of sackcloth and goat's-hair can be used for sacks or baskets,
but according to him who says that it means ‘real mats, it is well with regard to those of sackcloth and goat's-hair, since they can be used for curtains or for sieves but to what use can those of bamboo and reed-grass be put?
They can be used for [covering] brewing vats. 
Some read [as follows]:
It is well according to him who says [that hozlot means] ‘real matting’, since those of bamboo and reed-grass may be used for [covering] brewing vats while those of sackcloth and goat's hair can be used for curtains or for sieves,
but according to him who says that it means ‘bags filled with foliage, it is well with regard to those of sackcloth and goat's hair which may be used for haversacks or baskets, but to what use can those of bamboo and reed-grass be put?
They may be used for baskets of fruit.
It was taught: R. Hanina stated:
When I went down to the Diaspora I came across an old man who said to me, 
A reed mat may be used as skhakh.” And when I came before R. Joshua, my father’s brother, he agreed with his words.
R. Hisda said
only if it has no rim.
Ulla said:
Those mats of the people of Mahoza, were it not for their rim, would be valid as skhakh.
So it has also been taught: 
Reed mats are valid as skhakh, but if they have rims they are invalid as skhakh. ( May we return to you chapter “Sukkah.”)
He who sleeps under a bed in the sukkah has not fulfilled his obligation.
Rabbi Judah said:
we had the custom to sleep under a bed in the presence of the elders, and they didn’t say anything to us.
Rabbi Shimon said:
it happened that Tabi, the slave of Rabba Gamaliel, used to sleep under the bed.   And Rabban Gamaliel said to the elders, 
“Have you seen Tabi my slave, who is a scholar, and knows that slaves are exempt from [the law of] a sukkah, therefore he sleep under the bed.”
And incidentally we learned that he who sleeps under a bed has not fulfilled his obligation.
GEMARA. But there are not ten [handbreadths in the height of the bed]?
Shmuel interpreted, 
[that it refers to] a bed which is ten [handbreadths high].
We have learned elsewhere,
Both a hole which has been hollowed out by water or by insects or eaten through by saline corrosion, and similarly a row of stones, or a pile of beams, overshadow uncleanliness. 
R. Judah said, 
Any ‘tent’ which is not made by the hands of man is not considered a tent.
What is the reason of R. Judah?

Daf 21a

He deduces it from the word ‘tent’ [common to this and to] the Tabernacle. 
It is written here (Numbers 19:14), "This is the law, when a man dies in a tent," and it is written there (Exodus 40:19), "And he spread the tent over the Tabernacle" Just as there [‘tent’ means one] made by the hands of man, so here [it means one made] by the hands of man. 
And the rabbis?
The word ‘tent’ occurs many times, to include [all tents].
וסבר רבי יהודה כל אהל שאינו עשוי בידי אדם אינו אהל?
But we contrast this with the following:
Courtyards were built in Jerusalem over rock, and beneath them was a hollow [made] because of [the fear of] a grave in the depths, and they used to bring there pregnant women, and there they gave birth to their children and there they raised them for [the service of the Red] Heifer. 
And they brought oxen, upon whose back were placed doors, and the children sat upon them with stone cups in their hands. ...
When they reached the Shiloah they went down into the water and filled them, then ascended and at again [on the doors]. 
R. Yose said, 
[Each child] used to let [his cup] down and fill it from his place because of [the fear of] a grave in the depths.
And it has been taught, R. Judah said,
They did not bring doors, but oxen. 
Now oxen, surely, are a ‘tent’ which is not made by the hands of man, and does it not nevertheless teach, R. Judah said: ...
They did not bring doors, but oxen?
When R. Dimi came he said in the name of R. Elazar,
 R. Judah agrees in, the case [of a ‘tent’ that is as large as] a fistful. 
So it has also been taught:
R. Judah admits in the case of overhanging crags and clefts of rocks.
But a door has many fistfuls and yet R. Judah teaches, 
‘They did not bring doors but oxen’?
Abaye replied, 
[It means that] they did not need to bring doors. 
Rava said, 
[It means that] they did not bring doors at all because the child, feeling confident might put out his head or one of his limbs and thus contract uncleanliness

Daf 21b

on account of a grave in the depths.
It has been taught in agreement with Rava: R. Judah said,
They did not bring doors at all, because the child, feeling confident, might put out his head or one of his limbs and thus contract uncleanness on account of a grave in the depths...
but they brought Egyptian oxen with wide bellies, and the children sat on their backs with stone cups in their hands. When they came to Shiloah they descended, filled them, and ascended and sat again on their backs. 
But has not a bed a breadth of many fistfuls
and yet we have learned: Rabbi Judah said, 
we were accustomed to sleep under a bed in the presence of the elders?
A bed is different, since it is made [to be slept] upon.
But are not oxen also made [to be sat] upon? When Rabin came he explained in the name of R. Elazar: 
Oxen are different, since they provide shelter for shepherds in summer from the sun, and in the rainy season from the rain.
If so, should not a bed [also be so regarded] since it provides shelter to the shoes and sandals under it?
The fact is, said Rava,
that oxen are different since they naturally shelter their entrails, as it is written (Job 10), "You have clothed me with skin and flesh, and covered me with bones and sinews."
And if you like[you may say that]
R. Judah follows his own view that
a Sukkah must be a permanent abode; and since a bed is but a temporary abode, while a Sukkah is a permanent ‘tent’, a temporary tent cannot annul a permanent one.
But does not R. Shimon also say that a Sukkah must be a permanent abode, and yet [he holds that] a temporary tent does annul a permanent tent?
It is in this that they differ
One Master holds that
a temporary tent can come and annul a permanent tent, while the other Master holds that
a temporary tent cannot annul a permanent tent.
R. Shimon said: It happened that Tabi the slave etc.
It has been taught: R. Shimon said:
From the casual conversation of R. Gamaliel we have learned two things. 
We learned that slaves are free from the obligation of Sukkah, and we learned that he who sleeps under a bed [in a Sukkah] has not fulfilled his obligation. 
But why does he not say, From the words of R. Gamaliel"? 
He informs us of something [else] by the way,
like that which R Aha b. Ada, and others say, R. Aha b. Ada in the name of R. Hamnuna said in the name of Rav:
From where do we know that even the casual conversation of disciples of the sages demands study? As it says, "And whose leaf does not wither" (Psalms 1:3). 
Mishnah: One who supports his sukkah with the posts of a bed, it is valid.
Rabbi Judah says: 
if it cannot stand on its own, it is invalid.
GEMARA. What is the reason of R. Judah?
R. Zera and R. Abba b. Mamal disagree. 
One says, 
It is because the Sukkah has no permanence, and the other says,
It is because he props it up with something susceptible to [ritual] uncleanliness. 
What [case] differentiates between them? If, for instance, he fixed iron stakes [in the ground] and covered them with skhakh
According to him who says, because it has no permanence, here there is permanence; according to him who says, because he props it up with something susceptible to [ritual] uncleanliness, he is here also setting it up with something which is susceptible to [ritual] uncleanliness. 
Abaye said:
They taught this only if he supported it, but if he placed skhkah above a bed, it is valid.
What is the reason? According to him who says, because it has no permanence, here there is permanence; according to him who says, because he props it up with something susceptible to [ritual] uncleanliness, here he does not prop it up with something susceptible to [ritual] uncleanliness.

Daf 22a

Mishnah. A disarranged sukkah and one whose shade is more than its sun is valid.
If [the skhakh] is thick like that of a house, it is valid, even though the stars cannot be seen through it. 
Gemara. What is meant by "disarranged?
Ravs said:
a poor sukkah;
And Shmuel said,
one whose reeds are not all on the same level.
Rav taught the [first part of the mishnah as] one [statement], while Shmuel taught it as two. 
Rav taught it as one: 
a sukkah which is meduvlelet, (what is meduvlelet? Poor, meduldelet) whose shade is more than its sun, is valid; 
While Shmuel taught it as two:
what is meduvlelet? Disarranged; and [the mishnah] teaches two [laws,] 
hat a disarranged sukkah is valid and that a sukkah whose shade is more than its sun is valid
Abaye stated,
this applies only where there are not three handbreadths of distance between one reed and another, but if there are three handbreadths between one and another, it is invalid.
Rava says,
even if there are three handbreadths between one and another we also do not say [that it is invalid] unless the upper reed is not a handbreadth wide but if the upper reed is a handbreadth wide, it is valid, since we apply to it the law of "beat and cast it down."
Rava said:
From where do I say that if the upper reed is a handbreadth wide we apply to it the law of ‘beat and throw it down,’ and if it is not so wide we do not apply it? From what we have learned: 
1) [With regard to] the roof beams of a house and of the upper story which have no plaster ceiling upon them and are in a line, [the upper ones exactly above the lower]: a) If there is uncleanness beneath one of them, all beneath that one becomes unclean. 
If it is between a lower and an upper [beam] what is between them becomes unclean. If it is above the upper [roof beams], what is directly above to the sky becomes unclean. 
[In the case] where the upper [roof beams] were [over the gaps] between the lower [roof beams]: a) If there is uncleanness beneath one of them, what is beneath all of them becomes unclean; b) If above them, what is directly above to the sky becomes unclean.
And on this it was taught,
when do these apply? When the beams are each a handbreadth [wide] and there is [a gap] of a handbreadth between them, 
but if there is not [a gap] of a handbreadth between them, if there is uncleanliness under one of them, whatever is under that beam is unclean while the space between them and above them is clean. 
Thus
it clearly follows that if there is a handbreadth we apply the law of ‘beat and throw it down’, but if there is not a handbreadth we do not apply this law. Conclude from this. 
R. Kahana was sitting and he recited this statement. 
Rav Ashi said to Rav Kahana, 
do we then not apply the law of ‘beat and throw down’ where an object is not a handbreadth wide?
1) Has it not in fact been taught:
if a beam was protruding from one wall, but was not touching the opposite wall, and similarly if two beams, one protruding from one wall and one from the other, were not touching each other, and [the space between them is] less than three [handbreadths] it is unnecessary to supply another beam, but if it was three [handbreadths] it is necessary to supply another beam. 
a) Rabban Shimon b. Gamaliel ruled,

Daf 22b

if the space was less than four [handbreadths] it is unnecessary to bring another beam, if not, it is necessary to bring another beam.
2) And so in the case of two parallel beams neither of which can support a half-brick, if they can support a half-brick on their joint width of a handbreadth, it is not necessary to bring another beam; if not, it is necessary to bring another beam. 
a) Rabban Shimon b. Gamaliel said,
if they can support a half-brick in its length of three handbreadths, it is not necessary to bring another beam; if not, it is necessary to bring another beam. 
3) If one was above and the other below: Rabbi Yose son of Rabbi Judah said, 
we regard the upper one as though it were lower down or the lower one as though it were higher, provided that the upper one is not more than twenty [cubits from the ground] nor the lower one less than ten [handbreadths from the ground]. 
From which it follows that if both of them were within twenty [cubits] we do apply the law of ‘beat and throw down’ even though none of them is a handbreadth [wide]?
He replied,
 solve it and say it this way: 1) Provided that the upper one is not more than twenty [cubits from the ground], but within the twenty [cubits], and the lower one is near it within less than three [handbreadths], 
2) Alternatively 
provided that the lower one is not less than ten [cubits from the ground] but more than ten, and the upper one is near it within less than three [handbreadths], 
3) But if they were three [handbreadths apart] since [the upper beam] is not a handbreadth [wide], we do not apply the law of ‘beat and throw down’.
Whose shade is more than its sun is valid. 
But if they are equal it is invalid? But have we not learnt in the other chapter,
‘or whose sun is more than its shade, is invalid’, from which it follows that if they are equal it is valid? 
There is no difficulty,
since the former refers to above and the latter to below. 
R. Papa said, 
this is like what people say,
‘the size of a zuz above becomes the size of an issar below’.
If thick like a house. 
Our rabbis have taught,
if it is thick like a house, even though the stars cannot be seen through it, it is valid. 
If the rays of the sun cannot be seen through it: Bet Shammai invalidates it, and Bet Hillel declares it valid.
Mishnah 1) One who makes his sukkah on the top of a wagon, or on the deck of a ship, it is valid and one may go up into it on the festival. 
2) If he made it on the top of a tree, or on the back of a camel, it is valid, but one may not go up into it on the festival. 
3) If the tree [formed] two [walls] and one was made by the hands of man, or if two were made by the hands of man and one was formed by the tree, it is valid, but one may not go up into it on the festival. 
4) If three walls were made by the hands of man and one was formed by the tree, it is valid and one may go up into it on the festival.

Daf 23a

This is the general rule: 
in any case in which if the tree was removed the [sukkah] could stand on its own, it is valid and one may go up into it on the festival. 
GEMARA. According to whom is our Mishnah? According to R. Akiva, 
as it has been taught, 
He who builds his Sukkah on the deck of a ship, R. Gamaliel declares it invalid and R. Akiva 
valid. It happened with R. Gamaliel and R. Akiba when they were journeying on a ship that R. Akiva got up and built a sukkah on the deck of the ship.
The next day the wind blew and tore it away. 
R. Gamaliel said to him, 
Akiva, where is your Sukkah?
Abaye said:
All agree that where it is unable to withstand a normal land breeze it is nothing; If it can withstand an unusually [strong] land breeze, all agree that it is valid. 
Where do they dispute? Where it can withstand a normal land breeze, but not a normal sea breeze; 
R. Gamaliel holds that
the Sukkah must be a permanent abode, and since it cannot withstand a normal sea breeze, it is nothing,
While R. Akiva is of the opinion that
the sukkah must be a temporary abode, and since it can withstand a normal land breeze, it is valid.
Or on the back of a camel etc. 
According to whom is [this part of] our Mishnah? According to R. Meir, 
as it has been taught,
If he makes his Sukkah upon the back of an animal, R. Meir declares it valid and R. Judah invalid.
What is the reasoning of R. Judah? Scripture says, "You shall keep the festival of Sukkot for seven days:" a Sukkah which is suitable for seven days is called a Sukkah; if it is unsuitable for seven days it is not called a Sukkah.
And R. Meir? 
According to Torah law this [Sukkah] is also suitable [for seven days], and it is only the rabbis who decreed against it
If he used an animal as a wall of the Sukkah:
R. Meir declares it invalid and R. Judah valid,
for R. Meir used to say, 
Whatever contains the breath of life cannot be used as a wall for a Sukkah, nor a side-post for an alley nor boards around wells, nor a covering stone for a grave
n the name of R. Yose the Galilean they said,
Nor may a get be written upon it. 
What is the reason of R. Meir? 
Abaye said:
Lest it die. 
R. Zera said:
Lest it escape.
Concerning an elephant securely bound, all agree [that the Sukkah is valid], since even ifs it die, there is still ten [handbreadths height] in its carcass.
Regarding what then do they dispute? Regarding an elephant which is not tied up. 
According to the one who says: Lest it die, we are not concerned; According to him who says, We fear lest it escape, we are concerned.
But according to him who says, Lest it die, let us be concerned lest it escape? 
Rather regarding an elephant which is not tied up, all agree [that the Sukkah is invalid]; 
Regarding what do they dispute? Regarding an [ordinary] animal which is tied up:
According to him who says, Lest it die, we are concerned. According to him who says, Lest it escape, we are not concerned. But according to him who says: Lest it escape, let us be concerned lest it die? 
—Death is not a frequent occurrence.
But is there not an open space between [the animal's legs]?
[It refers to] where he filled it in with branches of palms and bay-tree
But might it not lie down?
[It refers to] where it was tied with cords from above. 
And according to him who says, Lest it die, is it not tied with cords from above? 
It might happen that it is made to stand within three [handbreadths] of the skhakh but when it dies,

Daf 23b

it shrinks, and he might not notice.
But did Abaye say that R. Meir is concerned because of the possibility of death while R. Judah is not concerned?
But haven't we learned: 
If the daughter of an Israelite was married to a priest, and her husband went to a country beyond the sea, she may eat of terumah on the presumption that he is still alive
And when we pointed to the following contradiction: [If a priest said to his wife,] ‘Here is your get [to take effect] one hour before my death’, she is forbidden to eat of terumah immediately.
Abaye answered that 
there is no difficulty, ...
since the former [statement] is according to R. Meir who is not concerned with the possibility of death, while the latter is according to R. Judah who is concerned the possibility of death
As it has been taught,
If a man buys wine from Samaritans he may say, 
‘Two log which I intend to set aside are terumah, ten are the first tithe, and nine the second tithe’, and then he redeems it and may drink it at once, the words of R. Meir.

Daf 24a

R. Judah, R. Jose and R. Shimon forbid it
Transpose [the statement:]
R. Meir is concerned for death, while R. Judah disregards is not concerned for death,
as it was taught,
If he used an animal as a wall for a Sukkah, R. Meir declares it invalid and R. Judah valid.
[But there is still] a contradiction between the two statements of R. Meir?
R. Meir can answer you
 Death is of frequent occurrence, but the splitting of a wineskin is infrequent, since one might give it in charge of a guardian.
[But there is still] a contradiction between the two statements of R. Judah?
The reason of R. Judah is not lest the wineskin split, but because he does not accept the principle of retroactivity (bererah).
But isn't R. Judah concerned about the possibility of the wineskin splitting? 
Surely since the latter part [of the baraita] states: They said to R. Meir, 
‘Do you not agree that [we must fear] lest the wineskin split, with the result that he drank untithed [wine] retroactively?’
And he answered them, 
‘When the wineskin splits’, it follows [does it not]
that R. Judah is concerned about the possibility of the wineskin splitting?
[No!] There it is R. Judah who says to R. Meir, 
"As for myself I do not accept the principle of bererah, but according to you who do accept the principle of bererah, do you not agree that [we must fear] lest the wineskin split?’
And the latter answered,
‘When the wineskin splits’.
But isn't R. Judah concerned about the possibility of death? 
Haven't we learned: R. Judah says,
Even another wife was prepared for him, lest his wife die? 
About this it was stated: R. Huna the son of R. Joshua said:
They adopted a higher standard with regard to atonement.
Now whether according to the one who says: Lest it die, or according to the one who says, Lest it escape, according to Toraitic law it is a valid partition, and it is the rabbis who made a restrictive enactment against it. 
But if this is so, according to R. Meir, it should convey uncleanliness [if it is used] as a covering stone of a grave,
why then have we learned:
R. Judah says it is subject to the laws of uncleanliness that are applicable to the covering tone of a grave, while R. Meir declares it unsusceptible to such uncleanliness?
Rather R. Aha b. Jacob said that R. Meir
holds that any partition which is upheld by wind is not a valid partition. 
There are others who say that R. Aha b. Jacob said 
that R. Meir holds that any partition which is not made by the hands of man is no partition.
What [practical difference] is there between [the two versions]? 
The practical difference between them is where he set up a Sukkah wall with an inflated skin. 
According to the one who which says a partition which is upheld by wind is not a valid partition, [this one is invalid] since it is upheld by wind; According to the version which says ‘not made by the hands of man’ it is valid,

Daf 24b



Daf 25a



Daf 25b

R. Akiva said:
They were Mishael and Elzaphan who were occupied with [the remains of] Nadav and Avihu. 
R. Yitzchak said,
If they were those who bore the coffin of Joseph, they had time to cleanse themselves [before Pesah] and if they were Mishael and Elzaphan they could [also] have cleansed themselves [before Pesah].
Rather they had been occupied with a dead body that one is commanded to bury, whose the seventh day [of purification] fell on the eve of Pesah,
as it is said, "They could not keep the Passover on that day," on ‘that’ day they could not keep the Passover, but the next day they could.
[Both texts] are necessary. For if he had only informed us of the former, I would have said [that they were free from the obligation there] because the time of the obligation of the pesah sacrifice had not yet come, but here where the time of the reading of the Shema had come, I would have said that he is obligated, [therefore] it was necessary [to have the later].
And if he had informed us of the case here only, I would have said [that one is exempt here] because this does not involve karet, but there where it involves karet, I would have said no. [Therefore the other was] necessary. 
[Going back to] the main text: R. Abba b. Zavda said in the name of Rav: 
A mourner is obligated in all the commandments of the Torah with the exception of tefillin since the word "beauty" is applied to them’. 
Since the God said to Ezekiel, "Bind your beauty upon yourself," (Ezekiel 24:17) you are obligated in this, but all other people are exempt.’
This, however, applies only to the first day, since of that day it is written, "And the end of it is as a bitter day" (Amos 8:10). 
R. Abba b. Zavda also said in the name of Rav,
 A mourner is obligated in the Sukkah
Is not this obvious? 
What might I have said?
Since R. Abba b. Zavda said in the name of Rav that
he who is in discomfort is exempt from the obligation of Sukkah, this [one] is also in discomfort, therefore he informs us that
this applies only to discomfort that comes on its own, but [the mourner] since it is he himself who is the cause of his discomfort, he must settle his mind
And R. Abba b. Zavda said in the name of Rav: 
A bridegroom and the groomsmen and all the wedding guests are exempt from the Sukkah all the seven days. What is the reason? 
Because they have to rejoice. But let them eat in the Sukkah and rejoice in the Sukkah?
There is no rejoicing but in the huppah.
But let them eat in the Sukkah and rejoice in the Sukkah?
There is no rejoicing but in the huppah.
But let them do the huppah in the Sukkah?
Abaye says:
 [They cannot] because of seclusion.
And Rava said,
Because of the discomfort of the bridegroom.
What practical difference is there between them?
The practical difference between them
 is a case where people are going in and out of there.
 According to the one who said "because of seclusion", the restriction does not apply; according to the one who said because of discomfort to the groom, it does. 
R. Zera said,
I ate in the Sukkah and rejoiced in the huppah and my heart rejoiced all the more since I was fulfilling two [commandments].
Our rabbis taught:
The bridegroom, and the groomsmen and all the wedding guests are exempt from prayer and tefllin, but are obligated to read the Shema.

Daf 26a

In the name of R. Shila they said:
The bridegroom is exempt, but the groomsmen and the wedding guests are liable.
It has been taught: R. Hanania b. Akavya said:
 Scribes writing [Torah] scrolls, tefillin and mezuzot, their agents and their agents’ agents, and all who are engaged in holy work including sellers of blue [for tzitzit] are exempt from the obligation of prayer and tefillin and all the commandments mentioned in the Torah, to confirm the words of R. Yose the Galilean, 
for R. Yose the Galilean used to say: 
He who is occupied with the performance of a mitzvah is [at that time] exempt from other mitzvot
Our rabbis taught: 
Day travelers are exempt from the sukkah during day but are obligated at night. 
Night travelers are exempt from the sukkah at night, but are obligated during the day.
Travelers by day and night are exempt both day an night.
Those who are going to perform a mitzvah are exempt both by day and by night.
As in the case of R. Hisda and Rabbah son of R. Huna who, when they went up to the house of the Exilarch on the Shabbat of the Festival, slept on the river bank of Sura, 
saying, 
‘We are messengers engaged on a mitzvah and are exempt.’
Our rabbis taught:
 The day watchmen of a town are exempt from the sukkah by day and obligated at night;
night watchmen are exempt by night and obligated by day;
day and night watchmen are exempt both by day and at night. 
Watchmen of gardens and orchards are exempt both by day and by night. But let them make a Sukkah there and dwell in it?
Abaye said, 
"You shall dwell" as you normally dwell
Rava said:
The breach calls out to the thief.
What practical difference is there between them?
The practical difference is when they are guarding a pile of fruit.
Those who are sick and their attendants [are exempt from the mitzvah of the sukkah]. 
Our Rabbis taught,
 The sick one spoken of here is not [only] one who sick and is in danger, but also one who is sick but not in danger, even one who has a pain in his eye or a pain in his head.
Rabban Shimon b. Gamaliel said:
On one occasion I had a pain in my eye in Caesarea and R. Yose Berebi permitted me and my attendants to sleep outside the Sukkah.
Rav allowed R. Aha Bardela to sleep in a canopy bed in a Sukkah in order [to keep out] the gnats. 
Rava allowed R. Aha b. Adda to sleep outside the Sukkah on account of the stink of the plaster.
Rava follows his own reasoning, since Rava said:
One who is in discomfort is exempt from the Sukkah. 
But have we not learned:
Those who are sick and their attendants [are exempt from the mitzvah of the sukkah]
One who is sick but not one who is merely in discomfort? 
I will explain:
A sick person and his attendants are exempt, whereas he who is in discomfort is exempt, but not his attendants.
Casual eating and drinking are permitted outside the sukkah. How much is considered casual eating? 
R. Joseph said,
 [The volume of] two or three eggs. 
Abaye said to him:
But sometimes this suffices for [a whole meal for] a man, and then it would be a set meal? ...
Rather Abaye said: 
as much as a student and then goes into the learning session.
Our Rabbis taught:
Casual eating is permitted outside the Sukkah, but not casual sleeping. What is the reason?
R. Ashi said:
It is a decree lest he fall fast asleep.
Abaye said to him
But what about that which has been taught,
"A man may sleep casually while wearing his , but not set regular, let us be concerned lest he fall fast asleep? 
R. Joseph b. R. Ila'i said: 
his refers to a person who entrusts his sleep to others.
R. Mesharsheya raised a difficulty:
Does not ‘Your guarantor need a guarantor ?
Rather Rabbah b. Bar Hana said in the name of R. Yohanan, 
This refers to where the person puts his head between his knees. 
Rava said:
There is no set amount for sleep.
One [baraita] teaches,
One may sleep casually in tefillin but not regular sleep, and another [baraita] teachers,
Both casual sleep and regular sleep [are permitted] while a third baraita teaches:
Neither a casual sleep nor a regular sleep [is allowed]!
There is no difficulty:
One refers to where he holds them in his hand, one to where they rest on his head, and one refers to where he spreads a cloth over them.
How long is casual sleep? 
Rami b. Ezekiel taught:
The time it takes to walk one hundred cubits. It has also been taught in a baraita:
He who sleeps in tefillin and [on waking] observes a seminal emission, should [remove the tefillin by taking] hold of the strap

Daf 26b

but he should not hold the box, the words of R. Yaakov.
The sages say:
one may sleep casual sleep in his tefillin but not a regular sleep. 
And what constitutes a casual sleep? The time it takes to walk one hundred cubits.
Rav said,
It is forbidden to sleep by day more than the sleep of a horse. 
And what is the sleep of a horse? Sixty breaths. 
Abaye said,
The sleep of the Master is as that of Rav, and that of Rav as that of Rabbi and that of Rabbi as of David, and that of David as of a horse, and that of a horse is sixty breaths. 
Abaye slept [by day] as long as it takes to go up from Pumbeditha to Be Kube. R. Joseph applied to him the verse,
"How long will you sleep, O sluggard, when will you arise out of your sleep" (Proverbs 6:9).
Our Rabbis taught:
One who wishes to go to sleep by day, if he wants he may remove [his tefillin] and if he wants he may leave them on.
At night, he must remove them and he may not leave them on, the words of R. Natan. 
R. Yose said
Youth must always remove them and never leave them on, for they are regular in uncleanness. 
Shall we say that R. Yose is of the opinion that a man who has seminal emmission may not wear his tefillin?
Abaye answered:
We are dealing here with the case of young men in the company of their wives, lest they grow accustomed to the practice. 
Our Rabbis taught: 
If he forgot and had sexual intercourse while wearing his tefillin he should not [remove them] by holding either the strap or the capsule until he wash his hands to take them off, since hands are busy.
It once happened that they brought a dish to Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai to taste, and two dates and a pail of water to Rabban Gamaliel and they said,
 “Bring them up to the sukkah.”
And when they gave Rabbi Zadok food less than the bulk of an egg, he took it in a napkin, ate it outside the sukkah and did not say a blessing after it. 
GEMARA. Does the case come to serve as a contradiction!
Rather, there is something missing in the mishnah, and it should be taught thus:
But if he wishes to be strict with himself, he may do so, and it does not constitute presumption
and so it also happened that they brought a dish to Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai to taste, and two dates and a pail of water to Rabban Gamaliel 


Daf 27a

and they said, 
“Bring them up to the sukkah.” And when they gave Rabbi Zadok food less than the bulk of an egg, he took it in a napkin, ate it outside the sukkah and did not say a blessing after it. 
But if it was the bulk of an egg, he must [eat it in] the Sukkah. Should we say that this is a refutation of R. Joseph and Abaye?
Perhaps [it means that]
less than the bulk of an egg does not necessitate washing of the hands and the benediction, but if it was the bulk of an egg, it necessitates washing of the hands and the benediction.
Rabbi Eliezer says: 
a man is obligated to eat fourteen meals in the sukkah, one on each day and one on each night.
But the sages say:
there is no fixed number, except on the first night of the festival alone. 
Furthermore Rabbi Eliezer said:
if one did not eat in the sukkah on the first night of the festival, he may make up for it on the last night of the festival. 
But the sages say: there is no compensation for this, and of this was it said: “That which is crooked cannot be made straight, and that which is lacking cannot be counted” (Ecclesiastes 1:15). 
GEMARA. What is the reason of R. Eliezer?
You shall dwell [in Sukkot for seven days]"--this implies just as you normally dwell. Just as in a [normal] dwelling, [one has] one [meal] by day and one by night, so too in the Sukkah [he must have] one meal by day and one by night.
And what about the rabbis?
 Like a normal dwelling place. Just as in a normal if he wants to eat he eats, and if he doesn't want to eat he doesn't eat, so too with the Sukkah; if he wants he eats, and if he does not want he does not eat.
But if so, even the first night of the Festival [he should not be obligated to eat there]?
R. Yohanan answered in the name of R. Shimon b. Yehozadak:
It was stated with regard to Sukkot, "The fifteenth," and it was stated with regard to the Festival of Matzot, "The fifteenth." Just as there the first night only is obligatory but from then on it is optional, so too here the first night is obligatory, but from then on it is optional. And from where do we know [that the first night of Pesah it is obligatory to eat matzah]? 
The verse says, "At evening you shall eat matzah" (Exodus 12:18) Scripture sets it as an obligation.
R. Eliezer further said…. 
But didn't R. Eliezer say that
a man is obliged to eat fourteen meals in the sukkah, one on each day and one on each night?
Bira said in the name of R. Ammi:
R. Eliezer changed his mind.
How does one make up for it? 
If you say with bread, he's just eating the [obligatory] meal of the festival day?
Rather how does he make up for it? By eating various kinds of desert. 
So it has also been taught:
If he made up [for a meal he has missed] with various kinds of desert he fulfilled his obligation.
 The assistant of King Agrippa asked R. Eliezer, 
[A man] such as I, who eats only one meal a day, may I eat one meal [in the Sukkah] and be free [of my obligation]?
He answered him,
Every day you draw out [the meal] with all kinds of appetizers for your own honor, and now you cannot add one appetizer for the honor of your Creator? 
He also asked him:
[A man] such as I who has two wives, one in Tiberias and one in Tzippori, and two sukkahs, one in Tiberias and one in Tzippori, may I go from one Sukkah to the other and thus be free from my obligation? 
He answered him, 
No! For I say that
he who goes from one Sukkah to another annuls the mitzvah of the first.
It was taught in a baraita: It was taught in a baraita:

Daf 27b



Daf 28a



Daf 28b

the verse [thereby] makes man and woman equal as regards all punishable acts in the Torah?
Abaye answered:
Indeed Sukkah is a tradition, but [the midrash] is still necessary,
Lest I would have said, since "You shall dwell" implies that you should dwell in the same manner as you ordinarily dwell; just as one's permanent home is for husband and wife, so too the Sukkah must be for husband and wife, therefore he informs us that it is not so.
Rava said:
It is necessary, since I might have said, derive [the law from a similar case] of the fifteenth, from the fifteenth of the Festival of Matzot: just as there women are obligated, so too here women are bound. Therefore he taught that [women are exempt].
And now that you say that Sukkah is a traditional law, what is the verse for?
To include converts. 
Lest I would have said 
"the homeborn in Israel," the Torah said, but not converts, therefore it informs us that it is not so.
[That women must fast on] Yom Kippur is deduced from [the statement of] Rav Judah in the name of Rav?
[The verse] is necessary [to include] the additional affliction.
Lest I would have said that,
since the Torah excluded the additional affliction from punishment and warning, women are entirely exempt from it, therefore he teaches us [that they are obligated].
The master said,
[The word] "every" comes to include minors.
But have we not learned:
women, slaves and minors are exempt from the sukkah?
There is no difficulty.
One source refers to a minor who has reached the age of education, and one source refers to where he has not yet reached the age of being trained.
But is not the obligation of a minor who has reached the age of being trained a derabanan (from the rabbis) commandment?
It is indeed of rabbinical origin, the Scriptural verse was merely a support.
A minor who is not dependent on his mother etc. What is meant by a minor who is not dependent on his mother?
The school of R. Yannai said,
Any child who when he relieves himself, his mother does not need to clean him. 
Rabbi Shimon b. Lakish said: He who wakes up and does not call his mother. But do not older ones also call their mother? 
Rather
he who awakes from his sleep and does not call "Mother! Mother." 
It once happened that the daughter-in-law of [Shammai gave birth to a child and he opened up the plaster of the roof and put skhakh above the child]. 
Did the mishnah cite the incident in order to contradict [the previous halakhah]? 
There is something missing, and thus it should be taught:
But Shammai is strict, and [indeed] it once happened that the daughter-inlaw of Shammai the elder gave birth to a child and he opened up the plaster of the roof, and put skhakh over the bed for the child.
All seven days [of the festival] a man must make the sukkah his permanent residence and his house his temporary residence.
If rain fell, when is one permitted to leave it? When the porridge becomes spoiled.
They made a parable. 
To what can this be compared? To a slave who comes to fill the cup for his master, and he poured a pitcher over his face. 
GEMARA. Our rabbis taught, 
All seven days, one should make the Sukkah his permanent residence and his house his temporary residence.
How so?
If he had beautiful vessels, he brings them up into the Sukkah, beautiful coverings, he brings them up into the Sukkah. 
He eats and drinks and spends his leisure time in the Sukkah.
From where do we know this?
As our rabbis have taught: 
You shall dwell" in the same manner as you ordinarily dwell. 
From here they said,
"All seven days one should make his Sukkah his permanent dwelling, and his house his temporary dwelling."
How so?
If he had beautiful vessels, he brings them up into the Sukkah, beautiful coverings, he brings them up into the Sukkah. He eats and drinks and spends his leisure time in the Sukkah.; he should study in the Sukkah.
But is this so? 
But did not Rava say,
Scripture and Mishnah [should be studied] in the Sukkah, but reciting outside the Sukkah? 
There is no difficulty,
One refers to reciting, one refers to examination.

Daf 29a

As was the case of Rava and Rami b. Hama when they were standing before R. Hisda, [first] they ran through the gemara together, and then they investigated the reasons. 
Raba said:
drinking vessels may be kept in the Sukkah, eating vessels outside the Sukkah
Earthenware pitchers and wooden pails [must be kept] outside the Sukkah.  A lamp [may be kept] within the Sukkah, while some say
[that it must be kept] outside the Sukkah;
 but they do not disagree, 
here refers to a large Sukkah and here refers to a small one.
If rain fell. 
It was taught:
Once a porridge of beans become spoiled
Abaye was sitting before R. Joseph in a Sukkah. The wind blew and it brought down twigs [into the food].
R. Joseph said to them: 
Clear my vessels out of here.
Abaye said to him,
‘But have we not taught, "once the porridge is spoiled."
He answered him:
For me, since I am delicate, this is like the porridge becoming spoiled for me.
Our rabbis taught,
If he was eating in the sukkah, and rain fell, and he went down from [the sukkah], they do not trouble him to return there until he has finished his meal. 
If he was sleeping in the sukkah and rain fell and he went +down, they do need not trouble to return him until dawn
They asked them:
Does it say שיעור (until he wakes up) or שיאור (until dawn)?
Come and hear: 
 Until it gets light (שיאור) and the dawn appears.
Both? 
Rather say
until he wakes up (שיעור) and the dawn appears.
They made a parable: 
It was asked of them: 
who spilled on whom?
Come and hear: For it has been taught: 
The master poured the pitcher over his face and said, 
"I don't want your service."
Our Rabbis taught:
When the sun is in eclipse it is a bad omen for the whole world. 
To what can this be compared? To a flesh and blood king who made a banquet for his servants and put a lamp in front of them. When he got angry with them he said to his servant,
"Take the lamp away from them, and let them sit in the dark."
It was taught: R. Meir said,
Whenever the heavenly lights are in eclipse, it is a bad omen for [the enemies of] Israel for they are accustomed to their blows.
A parable to a school teacher who comes to school with a strap in his hand. Who starts to worry? The one who is accustomed to being beaten every day.
Our Rabbis taught,
When the sun is in eclipse it is a bad omen for idolaters; when the moon is in eclipse, it is a bad omen for Israel, since Israel reckons by the moon and idolaters by the sun.
If it is in eclipse in the east, it is a bad omen for those who live in the east; if in the west, it is a bad omen for those who live in the west; if in the midst of heaven it is bad omen for the whole world.
If its face is red as blood, [it is a sign that] the sword is coming to the world; if it is like sack-cloth, the arrows of famine are coming to the world; if it resembles both, the sword and the arrows of famine are coming to the world.
If the eclipse is at sunset calamity will be delayed; if at dawn, it will come quickly: 
but some say the order is to be reversed
And there is no nation which is struck that its gods are not smitten together with it, as it is said, "And against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgements" (Exodus 12:12). 
But when Israel performs the will of God, they need have no fear of all these omens as it is said, "Thus says the Lord, 'Learn not the way of the nations, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven, for the nations are dismayed at them" (Jeremiah 10:2) the nations will be dismayed, but Israel will not be dismayed. 
Our rabbis taught:
on account of four things is the sun in eclipse: 
 On account of an Av Bet Din who died and was not eulogized properly; on account of a betrothed young girl who cried out in the city and there was none to save her; on account of sodomy, and on account of two brothers whose blood was shed at the same time.
And on account of four things are the luminaries in eclipse:
On account of those who write forgeries, on account of those who bear false witness; on account of those who rear small herd animals in the land of Israel; and on account of those who cut down good trees.
And on account of four things the property of householders is turned over to the government:
On account of those who retain in their possession bills which have been paid; on account of those who lend money with interest;

Daf 32b

There are those who cast one [source] against the other: 
We have learnt: 
he thorn-palms of the Iron Mountain are valid. But has it not been taught that 
they are invalid?
Abaye answered,
There is no difficulty:
The one refers to where the top of the one leaf reaches the junction of the next; the other to where the top of the one does not reach the junction of the other. 
R. Marion said in the name of R. Joshua b. Levi, and others say that Rabbah b. Mari taught in the name of R. Yohanan b. Zakkai:
here are two palms in the valley of Hinnom, and smoke goes up between them, and it is in that connection that we have learned the thorn-palms of the Iron Mountain are valid, and it is the entrance to Gehenna.
A lulav which is three handbreadths in length. 
Rab Judah said in the name of Samuel:
 The [minimum] length of the hadas and the aravah is three [handbreadths], and that of the lulav four, so that the lulav should extend one handbreadth beyond the hadas. 
And R. Parnakh said in the name of R. Yohanan, 
The spine of the lulav should extend a handbreadth beyond the hadas. 
Have we not learned,
a lulav which is three handbreadths in length, long enough to wave, is valid?
Say "
and long enough to wave"; 
and each one explains it according to his own view. 
Come and hear: 
[We have learned: the [minimum] length of the hadas and the aravah is three [handbreadths], and that of the lulav four
Is this not including the leaves?
No, excluding the leaves. 
The main text: The [minimum] length of the hadas and the aravah is three [handbreadths], and that of the lulav four.  
R. Tarfon says. 
A cubit consisting of five handbreadths.
Rava said:
May the master forgive R. Tarfon! 
Now that we cannot find a valid hadas three [handbreadths] long, would one of five handbreadths be required?
When R. Dimi came he said. [R. Tarfon meant]: 
Take a cubit which has [normally] six handbreadths, into five. Deduct from these the three for the myrtle and the remainder is for the palm-branch. How much then is it? Three and three fifths?
Do not then two statements of Shmuel contradict one another, for here Rav Judah says in the name of Shmuel, 
The [minimum] length of the hadas and the aravah is three [normal handbreadths],  and elsewhere R. Huna said in the name of Shmuel that 
the halakhah is in accordance with R. Tarfon?
[Shmuel] was not precise. 
Say that we can say that one is not precise when [this results in] a stringency but not when [it results in] a leniency? 
When Rabin came he said:  [R. Tarfon meant]:
Take a cubit of five normal handbreadths and make it into one of six handbreadths. Deduct of these three for the hadas, and the remainder is for the lulav
How much is it? Two and a half. 
Is there not still a difficulty between [the two statements of] Shmuel? 
He was not precise, and in this case his lack of precision results in a stringency since R. Huna said in the name of Shmuel that 
the halakhah is according to R. Tarfon.
Mishna: A stolen or withered hadas is invalid
One [that came from] an asherah or a condemned city is invalid. 
If its tip was broken off, or its leaves were detached, or its berries were more numerous than its leaves, it is invalid. 
But if he diminished them it is valid. 
But one may not diminish them on the festival.
Gemara. Our Rabbis taught,
"Branches of a thick tree" [means] [the kind of tree] whose branches completely cover its trunk
Now what [tree] is this? You must say that it is the myrtle (hadas). 
But perhaps it is the olive?
It must be wreathed, but [the olive] is not. 
But perhaps it is the plane tree?
The branches must cover its trunk, which is not the case [with the plane tree]. 
But perhaps it is the oleander? 
Abaye said,
"Its ways are the ways of pleasantness" and [with the oleander] this is not the case. 
Raba said [the same] from the following verse, 
"Therefore love truth and peace." 
Our Rabbis taught:
Plaited like a plait and similar to a chain—that is the myrtle. 
R. Eliezer b. Yaakov said
"The branches of a thick tree" [means] a tree the taste of whose wood and whose fruit is similar: Say, then, it is the myrtle.
A Tanna taught:
A tree which is "avot" is valid, and which is not "avot" is not valid.
What constitutes "avot"?
Rav Judah said:
When three leaves grow out of one spot.
R. Kahana said:
Even two and then one. 
R. Aha the son of Raba tried to find one [whose leaves grew] two and then one, since that was what R. Kahana said.  
Mar b. Amemar said to R. Ashi:
"My father used to call that a wayward hadas."
Our Rabbis taught:
If most of its leaves fell off and the lesser part remained, it is valid, provided that its plaited quality remains. 
But is not this self-contradictory? 
You said that if the majority of its leaves fell off it is valid and then it is stated, "provided that its plaited quality remains." But since two [of the three leaves] have fallen off, how is it possible to have it "avot"?
Abaye said: 
It is possible

Daf 33a

with the Egyptian hadas which has seven [leaves] in each nest, and [therefore] when four fall off, there are still three left
Abaye said:
[From this] we can deduce that the Egyptian myrtle is valid for the hoshanna.
But is not this obvious?
I might have said 
that since it has an accompanying name, it is not valid, therefore he teaches us [that it is valid]. 
But perhaps it is indeed so?
The Torah says, "branches of a thick tree," of any kind.
Our Rabbis taught:
If the larger part of its leaves were withered, and only three bunches of green leaves remained, it is valid.
And R. Hisda added:
Provided] that they are at the top of each [twig].
If its tip was broken off. 
Ulla bar Hinena taught, 
If its tip was broken off, and a berry grew on it, it is valid.
R. Yirmiyah asked: 
If the tip was broken off before the Festival, and the berry grew on it on the Festival, what [is the law]? 
Do we apply the law of "set aside" to commandments or not?
Let him derive this question from that which we have learned: 
If he covered it and it became uncovered, he need not cover it again. If the wind covered it, he must cover it again. 
And Rabbah b. Bar Hana said in the name of R. Yohanan:
They taught this only where it subsequently became uncovered, but if it did not subsequently become uncovered, he is exempt from [the duty of] covering it. 
And we asked concerning this: 
Even if it subsequently became uncovered, why must he cover it?
Once it has been set aside is it not permanently set aside?
And R. Papa said:
This implies that the law of "set aside" does not apply to commandments?
The question [of R. Yirmiyah] is concerning that very statement of R. Papa: 
Is he certain that the law of "set aside" does not apply to commandments,  irrespective of whether it creates a stringency or a leniency, or perhaps
he is doubtful, and therefore we apply it to create a stringency, but not to create a leniency? 
The question stands.
Can we say that these are according to the following tannaim?
If he transgressed and picked them off, it is invalid, the words of R. Elazar b. Zadok. But the sages declare it valid.
They thought to explain his in the following way: 
According to all the lulav does not need binding, and even if you find to say that it does need binding, we do not deduce [the laws of] lulav from those of Sukkah of which it is written, "You shall make’ [which implies] but not from that which is already made.
Do they not disagree on the following principle:
that the one who declares it invalid is of the opinion 
that we apply the law of "set aside" to commandments, while the one who declares it to be valid is of the opinion 
that we do not apply the law of "set aside" to commandments?
No! All agree that we do not apply the law of "set aside" to commandments, but they disagree here in whether we deduce [the laws of] lulav from [those of] Sukkah. 
One Master holds that 
we do so deduce them,
while the other Master holds that 
we do not deduce the laws of lulav from sukkah.
And if you want you can say:
If we held that the lulav needs binding all would have agreed that we deduce [the laws of] lulav from [those of] Sukkah; But they disagree here on whether the lulav needs binding, and concerning the dispute of the following tannaim:
Our Rabbis have taught: 
A lulav, whether [the other prescribed species were] bound with it or not, is valid. R. Judah says: 
If it is bound [with the others] it is valid; if it is unbound, it is invalid.
What is the reason of R. Judah?
He deduces it from the word "take" [which occurs here (Leviticus 23:40) and with] the "taking" with regard to the bundle of hyssop (Exodus 12:22). 
It is written here, "And you shall take on the first day" and there it is written, "And you shall take a bundle of hyssop." Just as there [it must be] a bundle, so here also [it must be] a bundle. 
And the Rabbis?
They do not deduce from the mention of the word "take" in the two passages.
Who is it that taught that which our Rabbis have taught:
It is a mitzvah to bind the lulav, but [even] if he did not bind it, it is valid?
Now who is it?
? If it is R. Judah, why is it valid if he did not bind it?
If it is the rabbis, then what mitzvah did he perform?
It is in fact the rabbis, and it is a mitzvah because of "This is my God and I will glorify Him."
Or if its berries were more numerous than its leaves.
R. Hisda said:
This matter was stated by our great master, and may God be his help!
They taught it only [if all the berries were] in one place, but if in two or three places, it is valid. 
Rava said:

Daf 33b

If the berries are in two or three places it is regarded as striped and [therefore] invalid. 
Rather if it was at stated, it was stated in this way:
or if its berries were more numerous than its leaves, it is invalid. 
R. Hisda said:
This matter was stated by our great master, and may God be his help!!
They taught this only if the berries were black, but if they were green they are merely a species of hadas and valid.
R. Papa said: 
Red [berries] are like black ones, 
since R. Hanina said,
black blood is [in reality] red blood except that it has deteriorated.
If he reduced their number, it is valid. 
When did he reduce them?
If you say, before he bound them, this is obvious?
Rather after he bound them? This then is a case of "set aside" from the very outset! 
Deduce from here that if something is "set aside" from the outset it is not [permanently] "set aside"? 
Indeed it refers to a case where [he reduced them] after he bound them,
but he holds that the binding is merely a designation, and a mere designation is of no consequence.
But one may not reduce them [the berries] on Yom Tov.
But if he transgressed and did pluck them it is valid. But then, when did it become black? 
If you will say that it became black from the previous day, then it is a case of "set aside" from the very outset. Deduce from here that something that is "set aside" from the very outset is not [permanently] set aside?
Rather it became black on the Festival. It is thus a case of being fit and then "set aside". Deduce from here that if something was fit and then was "set aside" it may become fit again?
No! Indeed it refers to a case where it became black from the outset; and you can deduce from here that something "set aside" from the outset is not permanently "set aside"; But a case in which it was fit and then was "set aside" you cannot deduce from here.
Our Rabbis taught: 
One may not reduce [the number of berries] on the Festival. In the name of R. Eliezer son of R. Shimon they said 
that one may reduce. 
But is he not fixing an object on the Festival?
R. Ashi said:
This is a case where he plucked them for food, and R. Eliezer son of R. Shimon holds the same opinion as his father who  said that
a work which is done without intention is permitted. But do not both Abaye and Raba say that 
R. Shimon admits in the case of "If his head is cut off will he not die" [that it is forbidden]? 
Here we are dealing with a case where he has another hoshanna.
Our Rabbis taught:
If it binding became undone on the Festival, he may bind it as one binds vegetables. 
But why [should this be necessary]?  
Let him make a proper loop? [This statement is] according to R. Judah 
who says 
that a loop is to be considered a proper knot.
But if it is according to R. Judah, it requires proper binding be required?
This Tanna [of the baraita] agrees with R. Judah on one point and disagrees with him on the other. 
Mishnah. A stolen or withered aravah is invalid. One from an asherah or from a condemned city is invalid.
One whose tip was broken off 
or whose leaves were detached, or a tzaftzefah is invalid.
One that was shriveled or had lost some of its leaves, or one grown in rain-watered soil, is valid.
Gemara. Our Rabbis taught:
"willows of the brook" means those which grow by a brook. 
Another interpretation:
"willows of the brook" one whose  leaf is elongated as a brook. 
Another baraita taught:
"willows of the brook,"
I only know that willows of the brook are valid. From where do we know that those grown on rain-watered soil and mountain willows [are also valid]? Scripture says, "willows of the brook," from any place.

Daf 34a

Abba Shaul says:
"willows" [in the plural means] two, one for the lulav and one for the Temple. 
And the rabbis from where to they derive [the law of the willow] for the Temple?
They learned a received tradition;
for R. Asi said in the name of R. Yohanan,
the laws of ten plants, the aravah and the water libation—are all a halakhah from Moses from Sinai.
Our rabbis taught:
"willows of the brook" those that grow by the brook excluding the tzafzefah which grows on the mountains. 
R. Zera said: 
What is the verse [that proves this]? "He planted and set it beside the waters, he set it as a tzaftzefah" (Ezekiel 17:5). 
Abaye said to him:
Is it not possible that [the latter part] is merely an explanation: 
"He placed it beside many waters," and what was it? A tzaftzefah?
If so, what does "he set it" mean? 
R. Abbahu said: The Holy One, Blessed be He, said:
I said that Israel should be before me as something placed beside many waters that is, a willow,
but they have made themselves as a tzaftzefah of the mountains
Some teach this verse in connection with the baraitha:
"He placed it beside many waters, he set it as a tzaftzefah." R. Zera raised a difficulty:
Is it not possible that [the latter part] is merely an explanation: "He placed it beside many waters" and what was it? A tzaftzefah? 
If so, what is meaning of ‘he set it’? R. Abbahu said:
The Holy One, Blessed be He, said: I said that Israel should be before me as something placed beside many waters, that is, a willow, but they have made themselves as a tzaftzefah of the mountains.
Our rabbis taught:
What is an aravah and what is a tzaftzefah?
A willow its stem is red, its leaf is elongated and its edge is smooth;
the tzaftzefah its stem is white, its leaf is round and its edge is like a sickle
But has it not been taught:
If it is like a sickle it is valid, if like a saw it is invalid?
Abaye said:
That was taught only with regard to the rounded aravah. 
Abaye said:
deduce from here that a rounded aravah is valid for the hoshanna
But is this not obvious? 
What might you have said?
Since it has an accompanying name it would not be valid, therefore he informs us [that it is not so].
But perhaps it is indeed so?
"Willows of the brook," the Torah says, implying from any place.
R. Hisda said:
Since the destruction of the Temple the following three things have had their names interchanged:
[What was called] halafta [is now called] aravta, and what was called aravta, is now called halafta. 
What is the practical significance of this? With regard to the lulav. 
[What was called] shifora [is now called] hatzotzratah, and what was hatzotzratah is now shifora. What is the practical significance of this? With regard to the shofar for Rosh Hashanah. 
[What was called] patorta [is now called] patora, and what was patora is now patorta. What is the practical significance of this? With regard to business transactions. 
Abaye said: I also add [that what was formerly called]
bei kasei [is now called] huvlila, and huvlila is now called bei kasei.
What is the practical significance of this? With regard to a needle found in the fleshy part of the second stomach. 
Raba b. Joseph said: 
I also add that [what was formerly called] Babylon [is now called] Borsif and Borsif is now Babylon.

Daf 34b

With regard to a women's divorce bills.
Mishnah: Rabbi Ishmael says: 
three hadasim, two aravot, one lulav and one etrog, even if two [of the hadasim] have their tips broken off and [only] one is whole.
Rabbi Tarfon says: 
even if all three have their tips broken off.
Rabbi Akiva says: just as there is one lulav and one etrog, so too only one hadas and one aravah.
Gemara. It has been taught: R. Ishmael said:
"the fruit of a goodly tree" implies one; "branches of palm-trees" implies one; "the bough of a thick tree" implies three; "willows of the brook" implies two, and even if two [of the hadasim] have their tips broken off,
 and only one is whole [the lulav is valid]
R. Tarfon said:
: three, even if all have their tips broken off. 
R. Akiva said:
Just as there is one lulav and one etrog, so there is one hadas and one aravah.
R. Eliezer said to him:
It is possible that the etrog should be bound with them in one bundle, 
[to this] you can say, 
is it written, "the fruit of a goodly tree and branches of palmtrees"?
It says only, "branches of palm-trees." 
And from where do we know that lack of fulfillment of one prevents fulfillment of the others? Scripture says, "And you shall take" [implying] that the taking must be complete.
As for R. Ishmael, what does he hold?
If he requires that the hadasim be whole, why should he not demand that they all be whole,  and if he does not require that they be whole why should even one [have to be whole]?
Bira'ah said in the name of R. Ammi:
R. Ishmael changed his mind.
R. Judah said in the name of Shmuel: 
The halakhah is according to R. Tarfon. 
And Shmuel is consistent with his own opinion, or Shmuel said to those who sold hadasim,
"Sell at the normal price, for if not, I will expound to you as R. Tarfon." 
What is his reason? 
If you say that it is because he is lenient, why did he not expound to them as R. Akiva who is even more lenient? 
Three with broken tips are common, one with an unbroken tip is uncommon.
1) An etrog which is stolen or withered is invalid. 
2) One from an asherah or a condemned city is invalid. 
3) Of orlah or of unclean terumah—it is invalid.  4) Of clean terumah, he should not take it, but if he did take it, it is valid. 
5) Of demai (doubtfully-tithed): a) Bet Shammai says it invalid, b) And Bet Hillel says it valid. 
6) Of second tithe, it should not be taken [even] in Jerusalem, but if he took it, it is valid.
7) If a rash spread out on a majority of it, or if its pitom is removed, if it is peeled, split, or perforated so that any part is missing, it is invalid. 
8) If a rash spread out on a lesser part of it, if its stem was missing, or if it is perforated but no part of it is missing, it is valid. 
9) An etrog [which is black] as an Ethiopian is invalid. 
10) An etrog which is green as a leek: a) Rabbi Meir declares it valid b) And Rabbi Judah declares it invalid
11) The minimum size of an etrog: a) Rabbi Meir says: 
the size of a nut. b) Rabbi Judah says: 
the size of an egg. 12) The maximum [size] is such that two can be held in one hand, the words of Rabbi Judah. 
a) Rabbi Yose says, 
even one that can only be held with his two hands.

Daf 35a

The rabbis taught: 
"The fruit of a goodly  tree" (Leviticus 23:40) a tree the taste of whose ‘fruit’ and ‘wood’ is the same. Say then that it is the etrog.
Say that it is pepper,
as it has been taught: R. Meir used to say, 
From that which it says, "And you have planted all manner of trees," (Leviticus 19:23) do I not know that the reference is to a tree for food?
What then does Scripture teach by "for food"? A tree whose fruit and wood taste the same. Say then that it is pepper.
This is to teach you that the pepper tree is subject to the law of orlah 
and that the Land of Israel lacks nothing, as it is said, "You shall not lack anything in it"?
There [one cannot use peppers] since it is impossible.
For what should he do?
If he takes one [peppercorn], it is unrecognizable; if he takes two or three, the Torah said, one "fruit" and not two or three fruits. Therefore it is impossible.
Rabbi said:
Read not hadar but ha-dir; just as the stable contains large and small [animals], perfect and blemished ones, so also [the fruit spoken of must have] large and small, perfect and blemished. 
But don't other fruits have large and small, perfect and blemished?
Rather this is what you should say:
Before the small ones come, the large are still existent [on the tree]. 
R. Abbahu said:
Read not hadar, but ha-dar, a fruit which lives upon its tree from year to year. 
Ben Azzai said:
Read not hadar, but hudor for in Greek water is called hudor. Now what fruit is it that grows by every water? Say it is the etrog.
If from an asherah or from a condemned city, it is invalid.
What is the reason?
Since it is condemned to be burned, [it is considered as though] its minimum size is destroyed. If from orlah, it is invalid.
What is the reason?
R. Hiyya b. Avin and R. Assi disagree on this point.
One explains
because there is no permission to eat it, and the other explains
because it has no monetary value.
Now you should think that 
the one who insists on permission to eat it [in order for it to be valid] does not insist upon [its having] monetary value, and that the one who insists upon monetary value does not insist upon permission to eat it
It was taught:
[An etrog] of unclean terumah, is invalid. 
This goes well according to him who explains, because there is no permission to eat it, but according to him who explains [that it can't be used] because it has no monetary value, why not?
Behold he can kindle it under his cooking!
Rather [with regard to] permission to eat it, all agree that it is necessary. They disagree only on the question whether monetary value [is also necessary]:
One Master holds that 
permission to eat it is necessary but monetary value is not necessary, 
while the other Master holds that
monetary value is also necessary.
What is the practical difference between them?
The difference is ...
the case of second tithe in Jerusalem according to R. Meir
According to the one who explains, because there is no permission to eat it, [second tithe is valid, since] there is permission to eat it. 
It may be concluded that it is R. Assi who said that the reason is that it has no monetary value, since R. Assi said:
An etrog of second tithe according to R. Meir, a person cannot fulfill his obligation on the Festival, and according to the Sages he may fulfill his obligation with it on the Festival. This is proved
The main text: R. Assi said:
An etrog of second tithe, according to R. Meir, a person cannot fulfill his obligation on the Festival with it, and according to the Sages he may fulfill his obligation with it on the Festival. 
Matzah of second tithe, according to R. Meir, a person cannot fulfill his obligation on Pesah with it, and according to the Sages one may fulfill his obligation with it on Pesah. 
Dough of second tithe, according to R. Meir, is exempt from hallah and according to the Sages it is liable to hallah.
R. Papa raised a difficulty:
his is well with regard to dough, since it is written, "The first of your dough" (Numbers 15:20). And with regard to the etrog also it is written, "To you" it must be yours. 
But with regard to matzah, does Scripture say, "your matzah"?
Rabbah bar Shmuel, or as some say, R. Yemar bar Shelemia said:
It can be deduced from the word "bread" which is common to both passages. It is written here, "The bread of affliction" (Deuteronomy 16:3) and there it is written,

Daf 35b

"And it shall be when you eat of the bread of the land" (Numbers 15:19); just as in the latter case it must be yours and not of tithe, so in the former case, [it must be] yours and not of tithe.
Can we say that the following supports [this view]:
Dough of second tithe is exempt from hallah, according to R. Meir, 
while the Sages say
that it is liable?
Can we say that the following supports [this view]!
It is the identical statement!
Rather [the question was whether we can say that]
since they dispute in this instance, they also dispute in the others
or perhaps dough is exceptional because Scripture says the words "your dough."
Or of unclean terumah, it is invalid; 
because there is no permission to eat it.
If it was of clean terumah, he should not take it.
R. Ammi and R. Assi disagree:
One explains: 
Because he renders it susceptible [to ritual uncleanness], while the other explains because he diminishes it
What is the practical difference between them?
For instance in a case where he called it terumah except for its outer peel.
According to the one who explains: Because he renders it susceptible [to ritual uncleanness], the prohibition does apply. According to the one who explains, because he diminishes it, the prohibition does not apply.
But if he did take it, it is valid. According to him who explains, because there is no permission to eat it, this is permitted to be eaten, and according to him who explains, because it has no monetary value, this has monetary value.
If it was demai. What is the reason of Beth Hillel?
 Because, if he wishes, he may declare his property to be ownerless and thereby become a poor person and he could benefit [from demai]-- now also we apply to it the expression "of yours."
For we have learned: 
Poor men and quartered troops may be fed with demai.
And Bet Shammai:
a poor man may not eat demai; as we have learned,
Poor men and quartered troops may eat demai
 and R. Huna said:
A tanna taught: Bet Shammai say that
poor men and quartered troops may not be fed with demai, while Bet Hillel say
that poor men and quartered troops may be fed with demai.
If it was of second tithe in Jerusalem.
According to him who explained: Because he renders it susceptible [to uncleanliness], behold he renders it susceptible [to uncleanliness];
according to him who explained because he diminishes it, behold he diminishes it
But if he took it, it is valid.
According to him who explains: Because there is no permission to eat it, [the ruling] is according to all. According to him who explains: Because it has no monetary value, according to whom [is the ruling]? It is according to the rabbis. 
If a rash spread out on the majority of it [it is invalid]. 
R. Hisda said: 
The following was said by our great Master, may God be his help!
This was taught only [where they were] in one place, but if they were in two or three places, [the etrog] is valid. 
Rava said:
On the contrary! If they were in two or three places the etrog is as though it is striped and it is invalid.
Rather if the statement was at all made, it was made in connection with the latter part [of the mishnah]:
if on its lesser part it is valid.
R. Hisda said,
The following was said by our great Master, may God be his help!
This was taught only [if they were] in one place, but if in two or three places the etrog is as speckled and invalid.
Rava said:
And if it is on its nose, even the smallest rash, the etrog is invalid.
If its pitom is removed. 
R. Yitzhak b. Elazar taught,:
 If its upper stem was removed.
If it is peeled. Raba ruled:  
An etrog which was peeled so as to resemble a red date is valid. 
But have we not learned,
 if it is peeled . . . It is invalid?
There is no difficulty:

Daf 36a

this refers to where all of it [was peeled], this to where only a part was peeled.
Split, pierced:
Ulla b. Hanina taught:
If it is completely perforated [it is invalid even if the hole is] of the smallest size; if it is not completely perforated [the hole must be of the minimum size] of an issar.
Rava asked:
If there developed in an etrog the symptoms [which render an animal] terefah, what is the law?
What is he asking about?
If it is peeled, have we not [already] learned it? If it is split have we not learned it also? If it was pierced have we not learned it also? 
He asked in accordance with the statement of Ulla in the name of R. Yohanan who said:
If the [contents of the] lung
pour out as from a ladle [the animal] is fit to be eaten, and
Raba explained that this applies only when the arteries are still whole, but if the arteries are rotted [the animal is] terefah. 
What is the ruling here?
Is it possible that in that case where the air does not affect it, it could become healthy again, but in this case where the air does affect it, it decays, or is it possible that there is no difference?
Come and hear:
An etrog which is swollen, decayed, pickled, boiled, Ethiopian (black), white or speckled, is invalid.
An etrog which is round as a ball is invalid.
 And some say: also if two are grown together.
An etrog which is half-ripe, R. Akiva declares it invalid, and the sages valid. 
If it was grown in a cast, so that it has the appearance of another species, it is invalid.
At any rate it teaches
"swollen or decayed."  Is it not,
swollen from without and decayed from within?
No! Both refer to the outside, and yet there is no difficulty. 
One refers to a case where the etrog is swollen even although it is not decayed; the other to a case where it was decayed without being swollen.
The Master has said:
An Ethiopian etrog is invalid.
But has it not been taught:
If it is Ethiopian it is valid, if it is like an Ethiopian, it is invalid? 
Abaye answered,
In our Mishnah also we learned of one that is like an Ethiopian.
Raba answered, 
There is no difficulty. The former refers to us, the latter to them.
A half-ripe etrog: R. Akiva declares invalid, and the Sages declare it valid. 
Rabbah said:
Both R. Akiva and R. Shimon said the same thing.
R. Akiva [refers to] that which we just said. R. Shimon—to what does that refer? To that which we have taught:
R. Shimon declares etrogs to be exempt [from tithes] when they are small.
Abaye said to him: 
But perhaps it is not so. R. Akiva may have stated his view only here, since the etrog must be "goodly," while [an unripe etrog] is not, but there he may agree with the sages
Alternatively,
R. Shimon may have stated his view only there, since it is written, "You shall surely tithe all the increase of your seed" (Deuteronomy 14:22) that which people bring out for seed, but here he might agree with the Rabbis.

Daf 36b

And there is nothing more [to say about it].
If it was grown in a cast, so that it has the appearance of another species, it is invalid
Rava said:
They taught this only in the case where it has the appearance of another species
but if it has its natural shape it is valid. 
But is this not obvious, seeing that it was taught: the appearance of another species!
It was necessary only in a case where it was cast in the shape of planks joined together.
It was stated: An etrog which has been gnawed by mice:
Rav said:
It is not "goodly."
Is this so?
Did not R. Hanina taste a part of it, and fulfilled his obligation [with the remainder]?
But isn't our Mishnah a difficulty against R. Hanina?
It is well that our Mishnah is not a difficulty against R. Hanina since the former might refer to the first day of the Festival, while the latter might refer to the second day;
but it is still a difficulty against Rav?
Rav could answer you:
Mice are different, since they are repulsive
There are those who say: Rav ruled that
"goodly" since R. Hanina tasted a part [of an etrog] and fulfilled his obligation [with the remainder]. 
But is not our Mishnah a difficulty against R. Hanina?
There is no contradiction
since the former refers to the first day of the Festival, while the latter refers to the second day.
The minimum size of an etrog:
Rafram b. Papa said:
As is the dispute here, so is the dispute with regard to rounded pebbles.
For it has been taught,
It is permitted on Shabbat to carry three rounded smooth pebbles into [a field] lavatory. And what must be their size? 
R. Meir ruled, 
The size of a nut, R. Judah ruled,
That of an egg. 
The maximum size etc.
It was taught: R. Yose said:
It happened with R. Akiva that he came to synagogue with his etrog on his shoulder. 
R. Judah said to him:
 Is this a proof?
They in fact said to him, 
That etrog is not goodly
They may not bind the lulav except with [strands of] its own species, the words of Rabbi Judah. 
Rabbi Meir says:
 It may be bound even with a cord. 
Rabbi Meir said:
It happened that the men of Jerusalem used to bind their lulavs with strands of gold. 
They answered him:
But they bound it with [strands of] its own species underneath [the strands of gold].
Gemara. Rava stated: 
A lulav may be bound even with sinew [of a palm], or even with [strips of] the roots of the date-palm.
Rava further stated:
What is the reason of R. Judah?
He is of the opinion that the lulab must be bound so that if one uses another species, the wreath would contain five species.
Rava further stated:
From where do I know that the sinew and roots of date-palms are species of the palm-tree? From what has been taught: 
[It is written]: "You shall dwell in Sukkot"—a Sukkah made of any material, the words of R. Meir. 
R. Judah said: The Sukkah must be made of the same four species as the lulav.
 And logic demands it:
If the lulav which is not used at night as it is by day, is valid only with the four species, is there not then much more reason that the Sukkah which is used both at night and at day, is valid only with the four species? 
They answered him:
Any a fortiori argument which begins with a stringency and concludes with a leniency is not a valid argument.

Daf 37a

If he doesn't find the four species, he would be sitting and doing nothing while the Torah said, "You shall dwell in sukkot for seven days"-- implying a Sukkah of whatever material.
And so with Ezra it says, "Go forth to the mountain, and bring olive branches, and branches of wild olive, and myrtle branches and palm-branches, and branches of thick trees to make Sukkoth, as it is written" (Nehemiah 8:15).
And R. Judah holds that
the other [species] were for the walls, while the ‘myrtle branches and palm-branches and branches of thick trees’ were for skhakh. 
And we have learned:
Planks may be used as a skhakh, the words of R. Judah.
 Therefore
sinews and roots of date-palms are a species of palm-tree. This is conclusive.
But did R. Judah really say that the four species can be used but not anything else? Was it not taught:
If he covered it with planks of cedar wood which are four handbreadths wide, everyone holds it is invalid. If they are not four handbreadths wide, R. Meir declares it invalid and R. Judah valid. 
And R. Meir agrees that if there is a space of one plank between every two planks, he may place valid skhakh between them and the sukkah is valid.
What is meant by ‘cedar’?
Myrtle. Like Rabbah son of R. Huna, since Rabbah son of R. Huna stated: In the school of Rav they said
that there were ten species of cedar, as it is said, "I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the acacia tree, and the myrtle" etc. (Isaiah 41:19). 
R. Meir says even with a cord. 
It has been taught: R. Meir said:
It happened with the nobility of Jerusalem that they bound their lulavs with [strands of] gold. They said to him:
Is that evidence?
They bound it in fact with strands of its own species underneath.
said to those who bind the hoshanna at the house of the Exilarch: 
When you bind the hoshannas at the house of the Exilarch, [be careful to] leave a handle so that there should be no interposition.
Rava said: 
Whatever is used to beautify it is not an interposition. 
Rabbah further stated: 
One should not hold the hoshanna with a scarf, for a whole "taking" is required, and in this case it is not. 
Rava said:
Taking hold by means of something else is also regarded as a valid "taking."
Rava said:
From where do I derive that taking hold by means of something else is also regarded as a valid taking?  From what we have learned: 
If the hyssop is too short, he may provide it with a thread or with a reed and dip it and bring it up, and then hold the hyssop itself when sprinkling.
Why?
Didn't the Torah say, "And he shall take hyssop and dip?" (Numbers 19:18).
Rather learn from there
that taking hold by means of something else is also regarded as a valid ‘taking’?
But why?
Perhaps that case is different; since [the thread or reed] was joined on [to the hyssop], it is regarded as part of it?
Rather [deduce] from here:
[If the ashes of the red heifer] fell from their tube into the trough they are invalid.

Daf 37b

From this it follows that if he threw them into the water they are valid. Now why [should that be so]? 
 Did not the Torah say, "And they shall take of the ashes . . . and he shall put" (Numbers 19:18)? 
Rather learn from here
that taking by means of something else is also regarded as a valid "taking."
Rabbah further stated: One should not thrust the lulav through the bound hoshanna lest some leaves are detached and form an interposition. 
But Rava said:
A thing of the same species does not constitute an interposition.
Rabbah further stated:
One should not shear the lulav while it is in the hoshanna,
since loose leaves might remain 
and form an interposition.
But Rava said: 
A thing of the same species does not constitute an interposition. 
Rabbah further stated:
It is forbidden to smell a hadas [used] for the [fulfilment of the] commandment, but it is permitted to smell an etrog [used] for the [fulfilment of the] commandment. 
What is the reason?
— The hadas since it is used for its smell, when he sets it aside [for the mitzvah] it is set aside from use for its fragrance. The etrog, however, since it is used as food, when he sets it aside [for the mitzvah] it is set aside [only] from [use as] food.
Rabbah further stated:
A hadas attached to the ground, it is permitted to smell it; an etrog attached to the ground, it is forbidden to smell it.
What is the reason?
— The hadas, since it is used for its smell, if you permit it [to be smelled], he would not come to cut it down. The etrog which is used for food, if you permit it [to be smelled] he might be tempted to cut it.
Rabbah further stated,
The lulav [must be held] in the right hand and the etrog in the left.
What is the reason?
This one is three commandments and this is only one.
R. Yirmiyah asked of R. Zerika:
Why do we bless only "To take the lulav"?
Since it is higher than the others. 
Let him lift up the etrog and recite the blessing over it? 
He said to him:
Since as a species it naturally is higher than the others.
And where [in the service] do they wave [the lulav]?
At “Give thanks to the Lord” (Psalm 118), at the beginning and at the end, and at “O Lord, deliver us” (118:25),
the words of Bet Hillel. 
Bet Shammai say:
also at “O Lord, let us prosper.” 
Rabbi Akiva says:
I was watching Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Joshua, and while all the people were waving their lulavs [at “O Lord, let us prosper”] they waved them only at “O Lord deliver us.”
GEMARA. Waving? Who mentioned this ?
It refers to there:
A lulav which has a length of three handbreadths, sufficient to wave with it, is valid,
and our mishnah says, 
And where [in the service] do they wave [the lulav]?
We have learned elsewhere:
The two loaves and the two lambs of Shavuot. How does he perform [the waving]?
He places the two loaves upon the two lambs and puts his two hands beneath them and waves them forward and backward and upward and downward, for it is written, “which is waved and which is lifted up” (Exodus 29:27).
R. Yohanan said:
He brings them to and fro to Him to whom the four directions belong, and up and down to Him to whom Heaven and Earth belong. 
In the west (Eretz Yisrael) they taught us thus: R. Hama b. Ukba said in the name of R. Yose son of R. Hanina:
He waves them to and fro in order to stop harmful winds; up and down, in order to stop harmful dews. 
R. Yose b. Abin and some say R. Yose b. Zevila said:
This implies that

Daf 38a

even the ancillary parts of a commandment prevent calamities;
for the waving is obviously a ancillary part of the commandment, and yet it stops harmful winds and harmful dews.
And Rava said:
And so too with the lulav.
R. Aha b. Yaakov used to wave it to and fro, saying:
This is an arrow in the eye of Satan
This, however, is not a proper hing [to do] since it might cause him to incite him.
One who was on a journey and had no lulav to take, when he enters his house he should take it [even if he is] at his table.
If he did not take the lulav in the morning, he should take it at any time before dusk, since the whole day is valid for [taking] the lulav.
GEMARA. You said that
 he should take it [even if he is] at his table. That is to say that he must interrupt [his meal]. 
But there is a contraction:
If they have begun they need not interrupt [it]?
R. Safra replied:
There is no contradiction:
here is refers to where there is still time [to perform the commandment] during the day, while the former refers to where there is [otherwise] no time.
Rava said:
What difficulty is this?
Perhaps one is a Torah commandment and one is a rabbinical obligation?
Rather Rava said:
If there is a difficulty, it is this:
He should take it when he comes home [even if he is] at his table therefore he must interrupt [his meal].
 And then it teaches:
If he did not take it during the morning he should take it at any time before dusk—therefore 
he need not interrupt [his meal].
[To this] R. Safra said:
There is no difficulty:
The latter refers to where there is still time during the day, the former where there is [otherwise] no time. 
R. Zera said:
What difficulty is this?
Perhaps it is a mitzvah to interrupt [one's meal for the purpose of taking the lulav] but if he did not interrupt it he should take [the lulav] at any time before dusk, since the whole day is valid for the taking of the lulav?
Rather said R. Zera:
[The difficulty] is indeed as we said previously; and with regard to your difficulty one is from the Torah and one is from the rabbis, here we are dealing with the second day of the Festival when [the obligation of taking the lulav on] which is only Rabbinical. 
And this can also be learned from a precise reading of the mishnah which teaches:
One who was on a journey and had no lulav to take. If you thought this referred to the first day of the Festival, is it permitted [to travel on that day]?
One who has a slave, a woman, or a minor read [the Hallel] to him, he must repeat after them what they say, 
and a curse be upon him.
If an adult recited to him, he repeats after him [only] Halleluyah. In a place where the custom is to repeat [verses], he should repeat; Where the custom is] to say them only once, he should say them once. [Where the custom is] to recite a blessing afterwards, he should recite the blessing afterwards. Everything is dependent on local custom.
GEMARA. Our Rabbis have taught:
They truly stated that a [minor] son may recite [Birkat Hamazon] for his father, a slave may recite it for his master, and a wife for her husband;
but the Sages said,
May a curse come upon that man whose wife and [minor] sons have to recite the benediction for him. 
Rava said:

Daf 38b

One can deduce important halakhot from the custom of [reciting the] Hallel. 
1) Since he says Halleluyah and they respond Halleluyah it may be inferred that it is a mitzvah to answer Halleluyah
2) Since he says: "Praise Him, servants of the Lord" (Psalms 113:1) and they respond Halleluyah, it may be deduced that if an adult recites [the Hallel] for one the latter responds Halleluyah.
3) Since he says: "Give thanks to the Lord" (Psalms 118), and they respond, "Give thanks unto the Lord," it may be inferred that it is a mitzvah to respond with the beginning of sections.
(So it was also stated; R. Hanan b. Raba ruled: 
It is a mitzvah to respond with the beginning of the sections.)
He says, "Please O Lord, save us, " (Psalms 118:25) and they answer, "Please Lord, save us:" from here it may be inferred that if a minor was reciting it for him, the latter answers after him what he says.
Since he says, "Please O Lord, send now prosperity," and they respond " Please O Lord, send now prosperity,"from here it may be inferred that if he wants to double [the verses] he may.
Since he says, "Blessed be he that comes" and they answer, "In the name of the Lord" from here it may be inferred that he who hears is like one who responded
They asked of R. Hiyya b. Abba:
 If one listened but did not respond — what is the law?
He answered them:
The sages, the scribes, the leaders of the people and those who expound laid down that
if one heard but did not respond he has fulfilled his obligation.
It was also stated: R. Shimon bar Pazzi said in the name of R. Joshua b. Levi who said in the name of Bar Kappara:
From where do we know that one who listens is as though he responds? From what is written: "Even all the words of the book which the King of Judah has read" (II Kings 22:16). But was it Josiah that read them?
Was it not, in fact Shaphan who read them, as it is written, "And Shaphan read it before the king" (II Kings 22:10). Rather from here [we learn] that one who listens is as though he responds.
But perhaps Josiah read it after Shaphan had read it? 
R. Aha b. Yaakov replied:
Do not even think this, since it is written, "Because your heart was tender, and you humbled yourself before the Lord, when thou heard what I said" (II Kings 22:19). "When you heard," not "when you read."
Rava said:
One should not say "Blessed be he that comes" and then [pause and] say "In the name of the Lord. Rather he should say ‘Blessed be he that comes in the name of the Lord’ together. 
R. Safra said to him

Daf 39a

‘Moses! Do you speak right?
The fact is that both here and there, it is the conclusion of the clause and the pause does not matter.
Rava said:
One should not say: "Let His great name" and then say "be blessed." Rather he should say, "Let His great name be blessed"
 R. Safra said to him:
Moses! Do you speak right?
The fact is that
both here and there, it is the conclusion of the clause and the pause does not matter.
Where the custom obtains to repeat.
It was taught:
Rabbi used to repeat [certain] words in it; R. Elazar b. Perata used to add [certain] words in it.
What does it mean to add?
Abaye explained:
He added the doubling beginning with "I will give thanks" to the end of the Psalm.
[Where the custom is] to bless, he should bless.
Abaye said:
This was taught only with regard to after [the Hallel], but before, it is a mitzvah to bless,
for Rav Judah said in the name of Rav:
For all commandments one blesses before (over) their performance.
And from where do we know that the word "over" means before? R. Nahman b. Yitzchak said: As it is written, "Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain and he overran <i>(vayaavor)</i> the Cushite" (II Samuel 18:23). 
Abaye said
from the following: "And he himself passed over (<i>avar</i>) before them" (Genesis 33:3).
And if you wish,
from the following: "And their king passed on before them (<i>vayaavor</i>), and the Lord at their head" (Micah 2:13). 
One who purchases a lulav from his fellow in the sabbatical year, [the latter] should give him the etrog as a gift, since one is not permitted to purchase it in the sabbatical year. 
GEMARA. What happens if he doesn't want to give it to him as a gift?
R. Huna said:
He should include the price of the etrog in that of the lulav. 
But why should he not pay him directly?
Because one must not give money for Sabbatical Year produce to an am haaretz. 
As it has been taught:
One must not give money to an am haaretz for Sabbatical Year produce, more than he needs for three meals. 
And if he handed [him] over [more] he should say, 
"This money shall be redeemed for [the ordinary] fruit which I have in my house"

Daf 39b

and [the purchaser] eats the produce [as though it has] the sanctity of the Sabbatical Year.
This however, applies only where one buys from what is ownerless
but if one buys from protected produce it is forbidden [to buy] even for as little as half an issar.
R. Sheshet objected:
And [if one buys] from what is ownerless, [may he buy] three meals and no more?
But there is a contradiction:
Rue, asparagus, fenugreek, coriander of the mountains, water-parsley and meadow-eruca are always exempt from tithe and may be bought from anyone in the Sabbatical Year, since the like of these is not guarded.
He raised the objection and he himself solved to it:
They taught [that only as much as is] sufficient for one's food (<i>mano</i>) [may be bought]. 
And so said Rabbah b. bar Hana in the name of R. Yohanan.
They taught [that only as much as is] sufficient for food (<i>mano</i>) [may be bought]. 
How do we know that "<i>man</i>" means food? Since it is written: "And the king appointed (<i>vayaman</i>) for them a daily portion of the king's food" (Daniel 1:5).
But if so, the lulav also [should not be bought]? The lulav is a product of the sixth year which entered the seventh. 
But if so, might not the etrog also a product of the sixth year which entered the seventh? 
In the case of the etrog we compute from the time of its gathering.
But behold both R. Gamaliel and R. Eliezer agree that as regards the Sabbatical Year the etrog's status is determined by the time of its blossoming, as we have learned, 
The etrog is like a tree in three respects, and like a vegetable in one.
 It is like a tree in three respects,
as regards the laws of orlah, of the Fourth Year, and of the Seventh Year; and like a vegetable in one respect

Daf 40a



Daf 40b

I include washing since it is a requirement common to all men and exclude a salve since it is not common to all men.
Who is the author of that [statement] which our Rabbis taught:
“for food” but not for a salve, “for food”, but not for perfume, “for food” but not for an emetic.
Who does this agree with? With R. Yose,
for if it were the Rabbis, they also exclude steeping and washing.
R. Elazar said:
Sabbatical year produce is redeemed only by way of sale.
But R. Yohanan said:
Either by way of sale or by way of exchange. What is the reason of R. Elazar? As it is written, "In this year of Jubilee" (Leviticus 25:13)  and then comes the following verse, "And if you sell something to your neighbor" [implying,] only by way of sale, but not by way of exchange.
And what is the reason of R. Yohanan? — Since it is written, "For it is a Jubilee, it shall be holy" (Leviticus 25:12); just as sacred objects can be redeemed either by way of sale or by way of exchange, so the produce of the Sabbatical Year can be redeemed either by way of sale or by way of exchange.
But what does R. Yohanan do with the verse, "And if you sell something to your neighbor"?
He requires it in accordance with the statement of R. Yose b. Hanina, 
as it has been taught, R. Yose b. Hanina said:
Come and see how serious is [even] the dust of the Sabbatical Year.  A man merely trades with the produce of the Sabbatical Year, in the end he sells his movable property and his clothes, as it is said, "In this year of Jubilee you shall return, each man to his possessions" and then comes immediately, "And if you sell something to your neighbor etc."
And R. Eleazar, what does he do with the verse of R. Yohanan?
He needs it in accordance with what has been taught,
"For it is a Jubilee, it shall be holy" (Leviticus 25:12) just as with holy objects the money [for which it is redeemed] assumes the same sanctity, so with the produce of the Sabbatical Year, the money [for which it is sold] assumes the same sanctity.
It has been taught in agreement with R. Elazar, and it has also been taught in agreement with R. Yohanan. It has been taught in agreement with R. Elazar:
[In the case of produce of] the Sabbatical Year the money [for which it is exchanged] assumes the same sanctity [as the produce itself], for it is said, "For it is a Jubilee, it shall be holy to you" just as with holy objects the money [for which it is redeemed assumes] the sanctity [of the holy object], and becomes forbidden, so with the produce of the Sabbatical Year, the money [for which it is redeemed] assumes the same sanctity [as the produce] and becomes forbidden.
[But] in case [you would say] that just as, with holy objects, the money [for which it is redeemed] assumes its sanctity and [the holy object itself] becomes desacralized, so also with the produce of the Sabbatical Year, the money for which it is redeemed assumes its sanctity and the [produce itself] becomes desacralized, Scripture explicitly says, "It shall be"—it remains in its original [holy] state. 
How so?
If with the produce of the Sabbatical Year he purchased meat, both the meat and the produce must be removed during the Sabbatical Year. If, however, he purchased with the meat fish, the meat loses [the sanctity of the produce of the Sabbatical Year], and the fish assumes it. If he purchased with the fish wine, the fish loses [its sanctity], and the wine assumes it. If he purchased with the wine oil, the wine loses [its sanctity] and the oil assumes it. 
How so?
The last object [purchased] assumes [the sanctity] of the Sabbatical Year, but the produce itself always remains prohibited. 
Now since the term "purchased" is repeatedly used, 
it is evident that only by way of sale [does it become redeemed], but not by way of exchange.
It was taught in agreement with R. Yohanan:
Both the produce of the Sabbatical Year and of Second Tithe may be redeemed with cattle, beast or fowl, whether live or slaughtered, the words of R. Meir.
But the sages say:
With slaughtered [animals and birds] they may be redeemed, but not with live ones, lest one rear flocks from them.
Rava said:
The dispute

Daf 41a

applies only to male [animals and birds], but with regard to female ones, all agree that they may be redeemed with slaughtered animals, but not with live ones, lest one rear flocks with them.
R. Ashi said:
The dispute concerns only the original produce itself, but with regard to secondary produce, both agree that [it can be redeemed] either by way of sale or by way of exchange.
And the reason that the term ‘purchased’ was repeated is that since in the first clause the term ‘purchased’ was used it was used in the latter clause also.
Ravina raised an objection against R. Ashi:
[It has been taught]: If a man has a sela [gained through selling the produce of] the Sabbatical Year, and wishes to purchase with it a shirt, what should he do?
Let him go to his regular shopkeeper and say to him,
‘Give me a sela worth of fruit’ and give it to him.
Then he tells him, 
‘Behold this fruit is given [back]] to you as a gift’,
and [the shopkeeper] answers him,
‘And here is a gift for you of a sela.' 
And then he may purchase with it whatsoever he desires.
Now here, surely, the sela is a secondary produce, and yet it teaches [that it may be redeemed only] by way of sale, and not by way of exchange?
Rather R. Ashi said:
The dispute [of R. Elazar and R. Yohanan] is over secondary produce, but with regard to the original produce all agree that [it may be redeemed] only by way of sale, and not by way of exchange.
"Both the produce of the Sabbatical Year and of the Second Tithe [may be redeemed by exchange]"— his refers to the money for which the produce is exchanged. 
For if you do not say so, then "tithe" also must mean actual tithe. 
But surely it is written, "You shall bind the money in your hand? (Deuteronomy 14:21).
Rather it must mean the money for which tithe [was exchanged], and so here also it means the money for which the produce of the Sabbatical Year [is exchanged].
In earlier times the lulav was taken for seven days in the Temple, and in the provinces for one day only.
When the temple was destroyed, Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai decreed that the lulav should be taken in the provinces for even days in memory of the Temple,
[He also decreed] that on the whole of the day of waving it be forbidden [to eat the new produce]. 
From where do we know that we must perform [ceremonies] in memory of the Temple?
R. Yohanan said: 
Since Scripture says, "For I will restore health to you, and I will heal you of your wounds, says the Lord, Because they have called you an outcast. She is Zion, there is none that seek for her" (Jeremiah 30:17). ‘There is none that see for her,' implies that she should be sought.
And that the whole day of waving should be prohibited.
What is the reason? 
The Temple may be rebuilt speedily, and people would say, 
"Did we not eat [new grain] last year from the time that light appeared in the east?
Let us now also eat it [from the same time]" and they would not know that in the previous year, when there was no Temple, once day dawned in the east it,was permitted [to eat of the new grain], but now that the Temple is rebuilt, it is only the [waving of the] omer which [begins] the permission to eat new grain.
But when [is this assume the Temple to be] rebuilt?
If you will say that it is rebuilt on the sixteenth [of Nissan], then obviously it is permitted to eat from the time that day dawned in the East? If, however, it is rebuilt on the fifteenth why should it not be permitted after midday, for we have learned, 
Those that lived at a distance were permitted [to eat of the new grain] from midday onward, because [they knew that] the court would not be negligent in the matter?
This was necessary [only in case] it is rebuilt at night,
or [on the fifteenth] close to sunset.
R. Nahman b. Yitzchak said: R. Yohanan b. Zakkai instituted this in accordance with a principle of R. Judah 
who holds that from the Torah the whole day is forbidden, since it is written,

Daf 41b

"Until this very day" (Leviticus 23:14) [which means] until the very day itself,  and he is of the opinion that 
the expression ‘until’ is meant to include.
But does he hold like him?
Does he not in fact disagree with him, as we have learnt
When the Temple was destroyed, R. Yohanan b. Zakkai enacted that on the whole of the Day of the Waving it should be forbidden [to eat of the new grain].
 R. Judah said to him,
But is it not forbidden from the Torah, since it is written, ‘Until the very day’ [which means] until the very day itself?
It is R. Judah who was mistaken.
He thought that
He thought that [R. Yohanan b. Zakkai] meant that it was forbidden as a rabbinical prohibition, but it is not so. He meant it as a Torah prohibition.
But does it not say, "He instituted"?
What is meant by "He instituted" is that he expounded (the Torah) and instituted the law accordingly. 
1) If the first day of the festival falls on Shabbat, all the people bring their lulavim to the synagogue [on Friday]. 2) The next day they arise early [and come to the synagogue] and each one recognizes his own [lulav] and takes it, 
since the sages said
“one cannot fulfill his obligation on the first day of the festival with his friend’s lulav.” 3) But on the other days of the festival one may fulfill his obligation with the lulav of his fellow. 
4) Rabbi Yose says:
if the first day of the festival fell on Shabbat, and he forgot and carried out his lulav into the public domain, he is not liable, since he brought it out while under the influence [of a religious act].
From where do we know this?
From what our Rabbis have taught,
"And you shall take" [implying] that there should be a "taking" in the hand of each individual.
For yourself" implies that it should be yours, excluding a borrowed or a stolen [lulav].
 From this verse the Sages deduced that 
one cannot fulfill his obligation on the first day of the Festival with the lulav of his fellow, unless the latter gave it to him as a gift. 
And it once happened that R. Gamaliel, R. Joshua, R. Elazar b. Azariah and R. Akiva were travelling on a ship and only R. Gamaliel had a lulav which he had bought for one thousand zuz.
R. Gamaliel took it and fulfilled his obligation with it; then he gave it as a gift to R. Joshua who and gave it as a gift to R. Elazar b. Azariah who took it, fulfilled his obligation with it, and gave it as a gift to R. Akiva who took it, fulfilled his obligation with it and then returned it to R. Gamaliel.
Why does it need mention that he returned it?
It teaches us something incidentally--
-a gift made on condition that it be returned constitutes a valid gift;
like that which Rava said:
 [If one say to his fellow], "Here is an etrog [as a gift] on condition that you return it to me," and the latter took it and fulfilled his obligation with it, if he returned it, he has fulfilled his obligation, , but if he did not return it, he has not fulfilled his obligation. 
Why did he need to mention that [R. Gamaliel] had bought it for one thousand zuz?
In order to let you know how precious to them was the opportunity of fulfilling a mitzvah.
Mar bar Amemar said to R. Ashi: 
My father used to recite his prayers [while holding the lulav]. 
They objected:
One should not hold his tefillin in his hand or a Torah scroll in his bosom and pray, nor should he urinate [while wearing them], or doze or sleep. 
And Shmuel said about this: 
The same applies to a knife, a dish, a loaf of bread and money?
In the latter cases he is not performing a mitzvah and, therefore, would worry over them but in the former one he is fulfilling a mitzvah and therefore he would not worry over it. 
It has been taught: R. Elazar b. Zadok stated:
This was the custom of the men of Jerusalem. When a man left his house he carried his lulav in his hand; when he went to the synagogue his lulav was in his hand, when he read the Shema and prayed his lulav was still in his hand, but when he read Torah or recited the priestly benediction he would lay it on the ground.
If he went to visit the sick or to comfort mourners, he would go with his lulav in his hand, but when he entered the Bet Midrash, he would send his lulav by the hand of his son, his slave or his messenger. 
What does this teach us?
It informs you how zealous they were in the performance of mitzvot.
R. Yose says: If the first day of the festival [fell on Shabbat, and he forgot and carried out his lulav into the public domain, he is not liable, since he brought it out while under the influence of a religious act].
Abaye said:

Daf 42a

They taught [that he is not liable] only when he had not yet fulfilled his obligation, but if he had fulfilled his obligation, he is liable.
But once he lifts it up, he has fulfilled his obligation!   
Abaye answered:
This is a case] where he held it upside down.
Rava said:
You may even say that he did not hold it upside down,
but here we are dealing with a case where he carried it out in a vessel.
But was it not Rava who said that
taking by means of something else counts as a valid taking?
That applies only [where the taking with something else is done] as a mark of respect, but not [if it is done] in a disrespectful manner.
R. Huna said:
R. Yose used to say: A bird [offered as] a burnt-offering that was found among other fowls and [the priest] thought that it was a bird sin-offering, and ate it, he is exempt.
What does he teach us by this ruling? That one who errs in connection with a mitzvah is exempt? But this is the same [as the Mishnah]?
What might you have thought? 
There [in the mishnah] he is not liable when he errs in connection with a mitzvah, because he performs a mitzvah, but here where he erred in connection with a mitzvah but he does not perform another mitzvah, I might have said that he is liable, therefore he informs us [that even here he is exempt]....
They objected: R. Yose says:
One who slaughters a daily offering which has not been properly examined on Shabbat, he is liable to bring a sin-offering and another daily offering
must be offered.
The other answered him:
That case is different, for it has been said concerning it: R. Shmuel bar Hattai said in the name of R. Hamnuna Saba who said in the name of R. Isaac b. Ashian who said in the name of 
R. Huna who said in the name of Rav:
For instance they brought it from a chamber that contained animals which had not been examined. 
1) A woman may receive [a lulav] from her son or from her husband and put it back in water on Shabbat. 2) Rabbi Judah says:
on Shabbat they may be put it back [into the water in which they were previously kept], on a festival day [water] may be added, and on the intermediate days [of the festival the water] may also be changed. 
3) A minor who knows how to shake [the lulav] is obligated [to take] the lulav.
GEMARA. Is not this obvious?
I might have said that,
since a woman does not come under the obligation [of lulab] she may not take it, therefore he informs us [that she may].
A minor who knows how to shake the [lulav].
Our Rabbis taught,
A minor who knows how to shake [the lulav] is subject to the obligation of the lulav; [if he knows how] to wrap himself [with a tallit] he is subject to the obligation of tzitzit; [if he knows how] to look after tefillin, his father must buy tefillin for him; 
if he is able to speak, his father must teach him Torah and the reading of the Shema.
What [in this context] could be meant by Torah?
R. Hamnuna said:
Moses commanded us the Torah, an inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.
What [in this context] is meant by the Shema? 
The first verse.
If [the minor] knows how to take care of his body we may eat food that has been prepared in ritual purity though his body [touched it]; If he knows how to take care of hands, we may eat food that has been prepared in ritual purity even though his hands [touched it]. 
If he knows how to answer [questions on whether he touched any ritual uncleanliness], a doubtful case on his part that occurs in a private domain is regarded as unclean, but if in a public domain as clean.
[If he knows how] to spread out his hands [in priestly benediction] they may give him terumah on the threshingfloors.

Daf 42b

If he knows how to slaughter [animals ritually] we may eat from [the meat of animals] which he has slaughtered. 
R. Huna explained: 
This applies only where an adult was standing by his side [when he slaughtered the animal].
If [a child] is able to eat an olive size of grain, one must remove oneself a distance of at least four cubits from his excrement or water. 
R. Hisda explained:
This applies only where the child is able to consume it in the time [which it takes an ordinary adult] to eat half a loaf.
R. Hiyya the son of R. Yeva said:
But in the case of an adult [the law applies] even if he cannot eat it in the time [which it takes a normal person] to eat half a loaf, since it is written, He that increases knowledge increases sorrow.
If [a child] can eat an olive of roast meat, they slaughter the pesah sacrifice on his behalf, as it is said, "According to the eating of every man" (Exodus 12:4). 
Rabbi Judah said:
Until he is able to pick out food. How so? If they give him a splinter, he throws it away; if they give him a nut, he eats it. 
May we return to you, chapter "A Stolen Lulav." 
1) [The rituals of] the lulav and the aravah are for six or seven [days]; 2) The Hallel and the rejoicing are for eight [days];
3) The sukkah and the water libation are for seven [days]; 
4) The flute is for five or six [days].
5) “The lulav for seven.” How so? 
a) If the first day of the festival fell on Shabbat, the lulav [is taken for] seven days; on any other day, [it is taken] for six. 
6) “The aravah—seven days.” How is this? 
a) If the seventh day of [the ritual of] the aravah fell on Shabbat, [it lasts] seven days; if it fell on any other day, [it lasts only] six.
7) The mitzvah of the lulav—how was it carried out? 
8) If the first day of the festival fell on Shabbat, they brought their lulavim to the Temple Mount, and the attendants would receive them and arrange them on top of the portico, and the elders laid theirs in the chamber.
And they would teach the people to say, 
“Whoever gets my lulav in his hand, let it be his as a gift.”
9) The next day they got up early, and came [to the Temple Mount] and the attendants threw down [their lulavim] before them, and they snatched at them, and so they used to come to blows with one another. 
10) When the court saw that they reached a state of danger, they instituted that each man should take [his lulav] in his own home.
GEMARA. But why [should it be forbidden to take the lulav on Shabbat]?
It involves only a mere movement, why then should it not override the Shabbat?
Rabbah said:
It is a restrictive decree, lest one take [the lulav] in his hand and go to an expert in order to learn [how to wave it]

Daf 43a

and thereby he will be carrying it for four cubits through a public domain. 
And the same reason applies to the shofar, and the same reason applies to the megillah.
But if so, the same should be true of the first day? 
The first day! The Rabbis enacted that he should take it at home [on the first day that falls on Shabbat].
That is true after the enactment, but what can you say about before the enactment?
Rather
the first day, since the obligation to take the lulav is from the Torah even in the provinces the rabbis did not decree, but with regard to the other days for which there is no obligation from the Torah to take the lulav in the provinces, the Rabbis did decree.
But if so, the same should be true now!
We do not know how to fix the New Moon. 
But they, who know how to fix the New Moon, let it override [the Shabbat]? 
This is indeed so;
 for in our Mishnah we have learned:
If the first day of the festival, fell on Shabbat, all the people brought their lulavim to the Temple Mount, while in another Mishnah we have learned [that they brought them] 
to the Synagogue,
consequently you may deduce
from these that the former refers to the time when the Temple was in existence while the latter refers to the time when the Temple was no longer in existence. This is conclusive.
From where do we derive that [the taking of the lulav] is Torah obligation in the Provinces?
 As it has been taught:
"And you shall take" that the lulav must be taken in the hand by everyone of you; "for yourself" that it must be yours, thus excluding a borrowed or a stolen [lulav];
On the day" even on Shabbat;
 "First" even in the Provinces;
"The first" this teaches that it overrides only the first day of the Festival.
The Master said,
"On the day" even if it is Shabbat.
But since [the taking of the lulav] is just ordinary carrying, do we need a verse to permit ordinary carrying? 
Rava said:
It was necessary only with regard to those things that enable the lulav, and this is in accordance with a ruling of that Tanna
of whom it has been taught,
The lulav and all the things that enable it override the Shabbat, the words of R. Eliezer. What is the reason of R. Eliezer?
Scripture says: "On the day," implying, even on Shabbat.
But what do the rabbis
do with the words "on the day"?
They need it to infer from it that on the day, 
[the lulav is taken] but not at night.
And R. Eliezer, from where does he deduce that [the lulav is to be taken] by day, and not at night?
He deduces it from the conclusion of the verse, "And you shall rejoice before the Lord your God for seven days" "days" but not nights.
And the Rabbis? If I learned it from that verse, I might have said that 
we ought to compare ‘days’ [mentioned here] with ‘days’ mentioned with regard to the Sukkah so that just as there [the expression of] ‘days’ includes nights, so here also [the expression of] ‘days’ includes nights.
And with regard to the Sukkah itself from where do we derive [that days includes nights]? 
From what our Rabbis have taught:
You shall dwell in booths for seven days,” (Leviticus 23:42) “days” includes the nights. 
You say that “days’ includes the nights. But maybe it means “days” but not the nights.
And this would be logical.
For the word “days” is used here, and it is also used in connection with lulav; just as there it means days and not nights, so here also it must mean days and not nights. 
Or take it another way:
The word “days” is mentioned here, and also in connection with the [seven days of the] preparation, (Leviticus 8:35) just as there it means days and also nights, so here also it must mean days and also the nights.
Let us then see to what it is more comparable.
We should deduce a thing whose performance is a matter of the whole day from a thing whose performance is a matter of the whole day, and let no proof be adduced from something whose performance is only for one moment.
Or take it another way:
We might deduce a thing which is a mitzvah for future generations from something whose mitzvah is for future generations, but we will not deduce a proof from the preparations which were not for future generations. So it was taught.

Daf 43b

Scripture says “You shall dwell” “You shall dwell” in order to point an analogy (gezerah shavah). 
It is stated here, “You shall dwell,” and with regard to the [seven days of] preparation it is also stated, “You shall dwell,” so that just as in that case the word “days” includes also the nights, so here also “days” includes the nights.
The aravah for seven days. How so?
Why does the [ritual of the] aravah on the seventh day override Shabbat?
R. Yohanan said:
In order to publicize the fact that it is a [commandment] of the Torah.
But if so, let the lulav also override Shabbat in order to publicize the fact that it is a from the Torah? 
In the case of lulav there is a restrictive enactment on account of the reason of Rabbah.
But if so, let us make the same restrictive enactment with regard to the aravah also?
In the case of the aravah the agents of the Bet Din would bring it but the lulav is entrusted to everyone.
But if so, ought it not override [the Shabbat] on any day? 
[If that were done] people would come to hold the lulav in light esteem.
Let it [the aravah] override [Shabbat] on the first day of the Festival? 
It will not be clear [that it is the aravah that overrides Shabbat, for] people might say that 
it is the lulav which overrides it.
Let it override one of the other days? 
Since [the permission to override Shabbat] was removed from the first day, it was transferred to the seventh.
But if so, let it override Shabbat at the present time also? 
We do not know when New Moon was set.
But in their case since they know when the New Moon was fixed, why should it not override [Shabbat]? 
When Bar Hadya came, he explained that 
this never happened. When, however, Ravin came and all the company that used to go down [from Palestine to Babylon] they stated 
that it did happen, and that it did not override [the Sabbath].
Does not then the original difficulty arise? 
R. Joseph answered:
Who says that [the ritual of] the aravah is [performed] by the taking of it? Perhaps it is done by its being stood up next [to the sides of the altar].
Abaye raised an objection against him:
The lulav and the aravah are for six or seven days.
Does [this not imply that the aravah is] as the lulav: just as the [ritual of the] lulav is [performed] by its being taken, so too [the ritual] of the aravah is performed by its being taken?
What kind of argument is that?
This one is performed in its way, and this one in its way.
Abaye raised another objection against him:
Every day they circled the altar once, but on that day they walked round it seven times. 
Does not this mean, with the aravah?
No, with the lulav.
But did not R. Nahman state in the name of Rabbah b. Abbuha ...
[that they circled] with the aravah?
 He said to him:
He told you with the aravah and I say to you with the lulav.
It was stated: R. Elazar stated [that they circled the altar] 
with the lulav. Rav Shmuel bar Natan said in the name of R. Hanina:
with the aravah.
And so too said R. Nahman in the name of Rabbah b. Abbuha: 
with the aravah....
Rava said to R. Yitzchak the son of Rabbah b. bar Hana:
O Son of the Torah, come and I will tell you an excellent statement which your father made.
With reference to what we have learned: Every day they circled the altar once, and on that day they circled it seven times, thus said your father in the name of R. Eleazar: 
with the lulav.
He raised an objection against him:
The lulav overrides Shabbat on the first day, and the aravah on the last day.
On time the seventh day of the [ritual of the] aravah fell on Shabbat, and they brought saplings of aravot on the eve of Shabbat and placed them in the courtyard of the Temple.  The Boethusians discovered them and took them and hid them under some stones.
The next day the ammei ha’aretz discovered them and removed them from under the stones, and the priests brought them in and stood them up on the sides of the altar. 
For the Boethusians do not admit that the beating of the aravah overrides Shabbat.
Thus we see clearly that [the aravah ritual] is in the taking of it? 
This is a refutation.
Then why should it not override [Shabbat]? 
Since for us it does not override [Shabbat] it does not override it for them either.
But is there not the first day of the Festival which for us does not override [Shabbat], but it does for them? 

Daf 44a

I can answer:
For them also it does not override [Shabbat].
Does not then a contradiction arise between those two mishnayot,
since one teaches 
“all the people brought their lulavim to the Temple Mount,” and the other mishnah teaches...
that they brought them] to the synagogue,
and we answered, 
that the one referred to Temple times and the other to the time after the destruction of the Temple? No; both refer to Temple times, but there is nevertheless no contradiction 
since the one refers to the Temple and the other to the provinces.
Abaye said to Rabbah:
Why in the case of the lulav do we perform the ritual for seven days in memory of the Temple, whereas in the case of the aravah we do not perform the ritual for seven days in memory of the Temple?
He answered him:
Since one fulfils the obligation [of taking the aravah] with the aravah on the lulav.
He said to him:
But that one he does on account of the lulav?
And if you will answer that one first raises it once and then raises it again, is it not a daily occurrence that we do not do so?
R. Zevid said in the name of Rava:
In the case of the lulav which is a Torah commandment we perform the ceremony for seven days in memory of the Temple
in the case of the aravah which is only a rabbinic commandment, we do not perform the ceremony for seven days in memory of the Temple.
According to whom?
If you will say, According to Abba Shaul,did he not say: It is written, “willows of the brook” implying two, one referring to the [aravah in the] lulav and the other to [the aravah for use in] the Temple?
If you will say it is according to the rabbis, did they not have it as an accepted tradition,
since R. Assi said in the name of R. Yohanan who said it in the name of R. Nehunya of the Valley of Beth Hovartan:
The laws of the ten plants, the aravah and water libation were given to Moses upon Mount Sinai.
Rather, R. Zevid said in the name of Rava:
In the case of the lulav, which has its Torah origin when performed in the provinces, we perform it for seven days in memory of the Temple; in the case of the rite of the aravah, which has no Torah origin for its performance in the Provinces, we do not perform it for seven days in commemoration of the Temple. Resh Lakish said:
Kohanim with physical blemishes enter between the Sanctuary and the altar in order to fulfil the mitzvah of the aravah.
Rabbi Yohanan to him: ...
Who said so?
‘Who said so?’
id he not himself say so, since R. Assi said in the name of R. Yohanan who said it in the name of R. Nehunya of the Valley of Beth Hovartan:
The laws of the ten plants, the aravah and the water libation were given to Moses upon Mount Sinai?
He rather meant this: 
 Who said that [the mitzvah is fulfilled] by taking, perhaps it is fulfilled by standing [the aravah] up [next to the altar]?
Who said that it may be done by priests with a blemish, perhaps it [may be done] only by unblemished priests?
It was stated:
R. Yohanan and R. Joshua b. Levi disagree:
One holds that the aravah is an institution of the prophets, 
the other holds that the aravah is a custom of the prophets.
It can be concluded that it was R. Yohanan who said: It is an institution of the prophets since R. Abbahu stated in the name of R. Yohanan:
The rite of the aravah is an institution of the prophets. This is conclusive.
R. Zera sad to R. Abbahu,
Did R. Yohanan really say that?
Did not R. Yohanan say in the name of R. Nehunya of the Valley of Beth Hovartan that ‘the law of the ten plants, the aravah ...
and the water libation were given to Moses on Mount Sinai?
He was silent for a while (Daniel 4:16), and then he answered: 
They were forgotten and the prophets re-instituted them.
But did R. Yohanan really say this?
Did not R. Yohanan in fact state
What I said was yours was in fact theirs? 
Rather: This is no difficulty–

Daf 44b

one statement refers to the Temple and the other to the Provinces.
R. Ami said:
The aravah must have a minimum size, it must be taken separately only, and one does not fulfill his obligation with the aravah in the lulav.
Since the Master said: It must be taken separately only is it not obvious that one cannot fulfill his obligation with the aravah in the lulav? 
What might I have said?
That that applies only where one does not lift [the lulav] a second time, but not where one does lift it a second time [he would fulfill his obligation], therefore he teaches us that it is not so.
R. Hisda said in the name of R. Yitzchak: 
One may fulfill his obligation with the aravah in the lulav.
What is its minimum measure?
R. Nahman said:
Three fresh twigs with leaves.
But R. Sheshet said:
Even one leaf and one twig.
One leaf and one twig! Could you really think such a thing? 
Rather say: 
Even one leaf on one twig.
Aibu said:
I was once standing in the presence of R. Elazar b. Zadok when a man brought an aravah before him, and he took it and shook it over and over again without reciting any blessing, 
or he was of the opinion that
it was merely a custom of the prophets. 
Aibu and Hezekiah, the sons of the daughters of Rav, brought an aravah before Rav, and he shook it over and over again without reciting a blessing, for he was of the opinion that 
it was merely a custom of the prophets.
Aibu stated:
I was standing in the presence of R. Elazar b. Zadok. A certain man came before him and 
said to him:
I have cities, vineyards and olive trees, and the inhabitants of the cities come and hoe the vineyards and eat the olives [on the Sabbatical year]. Is this proper or improper?
[R. Yohanan] rules that 
indeed it is improper
As the man was about to leave him and depart, 
[R. Elazar] said
I have now lived in the land for forty years, and I have never seen a man walking in the paths of righteousness as this man. 
The man went back and said to him:
‘What should be done?’ 
He answered him:
Abandon the olives to the poor and pay the workers for hoeing the vineyards
But is hoeing permitted [during the Sabbatical year]? 
Has it not in fact been taught:
“But the seventh year let it rest and lie still” (Exodus 23:11),
Let it rest” from hoeing and “lie still” from the removal of stones? 
R. Ukba b. Hama said:
There are two kinds of hoeing; one consists in closing up the fissures and the other in aerating the soil.
Aerating the soil is forbidden but closing up the fissures is permitted.
Aibu said in the name of R. Elazar b. Zadok:
One should not walk more than three parasangs on erev Shabbat. 
R. Kahana said:
They made this statement only [in reference to a man who was going to] his home, but if he was going to his inn he relies upon [the food] which he has with him.
There are those that say that R. Kahana said:
The statement was necessary even in the case of a man [who was going] to his home. 
R. Kahana said:
It actually happened with me, and I did not find even small fried fish.
The mitzvah of the lulav. How so?
A tanna recited in front of R. Nahman:
They arranged them upon the roof of the portico.
He said to him:

Daf 45a

What, does he really want to dry them out?
Rather say 
on top of the portico.
Rehava said in the name of R. Judah:
The Temple Mount had a double colonnade, one colonnade being within the other.
The mitzvah of the aravah—how was it [performed]?
1) There was a place below Jerusalem called Moza.
They went down there and gathered tall branches of aravot and then they came and stood them up at the sides of the altar, and their tops were bent over the altar.
They then sounded a teki’ah [long blast], a teru’ah [staccato blast] and again a teki’ah.
2) Every day they went round the altar once, saying, “O Lord, save us, O Lord, make us prosper” (Psalms 118: 25).
3) Rabbi Judah says: 
“Ani vaho, save us.”
4) On that day they went round the altar seven times.
5) When they departed, what did they say? “O altar, beauty is to you! O altar, beauty is to you!”
6) Rabbi Eliezer said:
[they would say,] “To the Lord and to you, O altar, to the Lord and to you, O altar.”
