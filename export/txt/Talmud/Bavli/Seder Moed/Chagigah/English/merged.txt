Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a

Mishnah: All are obligated in "the appearing" [i.e. making a pilgrimage on the major holidays to the Temple], except a deaf man, a mentally ill person, and a child, and one of doubtful gender, and one of double gender, and women, and slaves who are not freed, the lame man, and the blind man, and the sick man, and the old man, and he who is not able to go up on his feet.
What is the definition of a child? One who is not able to ride upon his father's shoulders, and to go up from Jerusalem to the mountain of the Temple. These are the words of the house of Shammai.
But the house of Hillel say,
Anyone who is not able to take hold of his father's hand, and to go up from Jerusalem to the mountain of the House, as it is said, (Exodus 23:14) "three times."
The house of Shammai say,
The "appearing" involves two pieces of silver and the hagigah a meah of silver,
but the house of Hillel say,
The "appearing" involves a meah of silver and the hagigah two pieces of silver. 
Gemara: What is the expression "all" to include?
It is to include one who is half a slave and half free.
But according to Ravina, who said, 
He who is half a slave and half free is exempt from the "appearing", what is the expression "all" to include?
It is to include one who is lame on the first day and well on the second day.
This agrees with he who says, All of the [days] can be [used as] "make up" from one to another [within the holiday. Meaning, if one didn't bring the sacrifice on the first day, he can make it up on the second, and if he missed it on the second, he can make it up on the third, etc.]; but according to him who says, All of them can be "made up" for the first day only, what does "all" include?
It is to include one who is blind in one eye.
But this is not in accordance with the following Baraita.
For Yochanan ben Dahabai, in the name of Rabbi Yehudah, taught,
He who is blind in one eye is exempt from the "appearing", as it is said, (Exodus 23:17) "He shall be seen" or "He shall see." As he went to see, so he went to be seen; just as he went to be seen with both eyes, so too to see with both eyes.
And, if you want I'll say
It is really what they originally said [that it refers to a half-slave, half-free man]. And that which is difficult to you because of Ravina [who already says he is exempt],there is no difficulty.
Here is according to the older Mishnah, here is according to the later Mishnah.
For it was taught in the Mishnah,
One who is half a slave and half free serves his master one day and himself the other day. These are the words of the house of Hillel.
The house of Shammai said to them,

Daf 2b

You have corrected it for his master, but you have not corrected it for himself.
To marry a slave woman, he cannot; a free woman, he cannot; to abstain [completely],
was not the world created only being fruitful and multiplying? As it is said, (Isaiah 45:18) "He created it not for nothingness; he formed it to be inhabited."
Rather, as a rectification of the world, they force his master and make him a free man, and he writes for him a bill on half his worth.
The house of Hillel retracted, to teach according to the words of the house of Shammai.
Except a deaf man, a mentally ill person, and a child etc. 
It was taught in a Baraita, A deaf man is like a mentally ill person and a child. Just as a mentally ill person and a child are not considered capable of awareness [i.e responsible for their actions], so too a deaf man is not considered capable of awareness [i.e responsible for his actions].
And it is teaching us as we are taught by a Mishnah,
The deaf man that the Sages referred to in every place, is one who does not hear and does not speak.
Implying, he who speaks and does not hear, or he who hears and does not speak, is obligated [to appear at the Temple during the holidays]?
There is a Baraitha for this, for our Rabbis have taught,
He who speaks and does not hear is deaf, he who hears and does not speak is dumb. Both one and the other are to be treated as capable persons in all that relates to them.
And from where do you infer that he who speaks and does not hear is deaf, and that he who hears and does not speak is dumb? Since it is written, (Psalms 38:14) "But I as a deaf man hear not; and I am as a dumb man, who opens not his mouth."
And if you want, I'll say [alternatively], according to the proverbial saying,
A man stumbling in his words.
He who speaks and does not hear, or he who hears and does not speak, is obligated.
But there is a Baraita,
He who speaks and does not hear, or he who hears and does not speak, is exempt!
Ravina, and some say Rava, said,
There is missing text, and it was taught thusly:
All are obligated in the "appearing", and in the rejoicing, except a deaf man. He who speaks and does not hear, or he who hears and does not speak, is exempt from the "appearing". 
And even though he is exempt from the "appearing", he is obligated in the rejoicing.
But he who does not hear and does not speak, and a mentally ill person and a child, is exempt also from the rejoicing, since they are exempt from all the commandments which are said in the Torah.
There is also a Baraita to this effect,
All are obligated in the "appearing" and in the rejoicing except a deaf man. He who speaks and does not hear, and he who hears and does not speak, are exempt from the "appearing". But although he is exempt from the "appearing",

Daf 3a

he is obligated in the rejoicing.
But one who does not hear and does not speak, and a mentally ill person and a child, they are exempt even from the rejoicing, since they are exempt from all the commandments which are said in the Torah.
What is the difference regarding the "appearing", that they are exempt, and regarding rejoicing, that they are obligated?
Regarding the "appearing" there is an exegetical tradition, "appearing"/"appearing" from the Hakhel Assembly as it is written, (Deuteronomy 31:12) "Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones," and it is written, (Deuteronomy 31:11) "When all Israel comes to appear."
And there, how do we know [that those who are mute or deaf are exempt from the assembly]?
Because it is written,(Deuteronomy 31:12) "that they may hear and that they may learn." And it was taught in a Baraita:
"That they may hear" - excluding he who speaks and does not hear; "and that they may learn" - excluding he who hears and does not speak. Is this to say, that he who cannot talk cannot learn?
But there once was two mute men who were in the neighborhood of Rabbi, sons of R. Yochanan ben Gudgodah's daughter (and some say it was the sons of R. Yochanan's sister), that every time Rabbi went in to the house of study, they would enter and sit before him, and they would shake their heads, and move their lips,
and Rabbi asked for mercy for them, and they were healed, and it was ascertained that they were knowledgable of Halachah and Sifra and Sifre and all the Six Orders [of the Mishnah].
Mar Zutra said,
The reading there is, "in order that they may teach."
R. Ashi said,
Certainly it is, "in order that they may teach"; for, if you imagine that it is, "in order that they may learn," then, since he who does not talk does not learn, and since he who does not hear does not learn, this sense of learn comes out of the words, "in order that they may hear,"
but assuredly it is here, "in order that they may teach."
R. Tanchum said,
He who is deaf in one ear is exempt from the "appearing", as it is said, (Deuteronomy 31:11) "in their ears."
But "in their ears" is needed [for a different proof] - 
in the ears of all Israel
This this comes out of the words "before all Israel."
If it were [learned out only] from "before all Israel", I would say
even they could not all hear, the Merciful One wrote "in their ears", they must have heard.
That is derived from "in order that they may hear"!
R. Tanchum said,
He that is lame in one foot is exempt from the "appearing", as it is said, "footgoing (regel) times."
But this "footgoing times," is needed to exempt men with wooden legs!
This comes out of "pe'amim" [which can be translated both as "times" and "steps"],
for it is taught in a Baraita:
"Pe'amim" refers not to "times" but "feet", and so it says, (Isaiah 26:6) "The foot shall tread it down, the feet of the poor, the feet ("pe'amei") of the needy," and it says, (Song of Songs 7:2) "How beautiful are your feet (pa'amech") in shoes, O prince's daughter!"
Rava expounded:
What is the meaning of that which is written, (Song of Songs 7:2) "How beautiful are thy steps in shoes, O prince's daughter"? How comely are the feet of Israel at the time when they go up for the pilgrimage! "Prince's daughter" means the daughter of Abraham our father, who is called prince, as it is said, (Psalms 47:10) "The princes of the peoples are gathered together to be the people of the God of Abraham."
"God of Abraham" - and not God of Isaac and Jacob?!
Rather, 
"God of Abraham " - for he was the first of the proselytes.
R. Kahane said, R. Natan bar Minyumi expounded in the name of R. Tanchum:
What is the meaning of that which is written: (Genesis 37:24) "And the pit was empty, there was no water in it." This is implied [once it says] "And the pit was empty". Do I not know that there was no water in it?
Rather,
there was no water in it, but there were serpents and scorpions in it.
Our Rabbis have taught,
It happened to R. Yochanan ben Beruka and R. Elazar ben Chisma, that they went to visit R. Yehoshua in Pekiin. He said to them,
What innovation was there in the house of study today?
They said to him,
We are your students, and of your waters do we drink.
He said to them,
Even so, it is impossible for the house of study to be without something new. Whose week was it?
It was R. Elazar ben Azariah's.
And what was the discussion on today?
They said to him,
On the section of Hakhel ("Assembly").
And what was his exposition?
(Deuteronomy 31:12) "Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones". If the men come to learn, and if the women come to hear, why do the little ones come?
In order to give reward for those that bring them.
He said to them,
There was a beautiful pearl in your hand, and you sought to deprive me of it!
Further, he expounded:
(Deuteronomy 26:17-18) "You have declared of God this day... and God has declared this day..." The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel,
You make Me a unique division in the world, and I will make you unique division in the world. "You make Me a unique division" - that it is written, (Deuteronomy 6:4) "Hear, O Israel the Lord is our God, the Lord is one," and I will make you a unique division in the world, for it is said,

Daf 3b

(I Chronicles 17:21) "Who is like your people Israel, a nation that is alone on the earth?"
And he also opened his mouth and expounded:
(Ecclesiastes 12:11) "The words of the wise are like staffs, and as nails planted are the words of the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd."
Why are the words of the Torah likened to a staff?
It is to tell you,
Just as a staff is what direct the heifer in her furrows, so as to produce sustenance for the world, so too the words of the Torah direct the learners of them from paths of death to the paths of life.
If you say, that just as a staff is what moves, so the words of the Torah will move; the text teaches "nails." 
If you say, that just as a nail is a thing which diminishes and does not add, so too the words of the Torah diminish and do not add, the text teaches "planted." Just as planting is a thing which is fruitful and multiplies, so too the words of the Torah are fruitful and multiply.
‘The masters of assemblies’: these are the disciples of the wise, who sit in manifold assemblies and occupy themselves with the Torah, some pronouncing unclean and others pronouncing clean, some prohibiting and others permitting, some disqualifying and others declaring fit. 
Should a man say: How in these circumstances shall I learn Torah? 
Therefore the text says: 
‘All of them are given from one Shepherd’. One God gave them; one leader uttered them from the mouth of the Lord of all creation, blessed be He; for it is written: (Exodus 20:1) ‘And God spoke all these words’.
Also make your ear as the upper millstone, and acquire for yourself an understanding heart to hear the words of those who declare unclean and the words of those who declare clean, the words of those who forbid and the words of those who permit, the words of those who disqualify and the words of those who pronounce ceremonially pure.
In this same way he said to them,
It is not an orphan generation when R. Elazar ben Azariah lives in it.
And why did they not tell him without hesitation?
Because of that which happened,
that it was taught: When R. Yosi ben Durmaskit came before R. Eliezer in Lod, [R. Eliezer] said to him, 
What innovation was in the Beit HaMidrash today?
[R. Yosi] replied, 
They counted votes and concluded
that Ammon and Moab must give the poor man’s tithe in the Sabbatical year.
[R. Eliezer] said to him,
Yosi, extend your hand and receive your eyes [for they will fall out for saying that this is a new thing]!
He extended his hand and received his eyes [he realized that he had made a mistake].
R. Eliezer wept and proclaimed, 
(Psalms 25:14) “God’s secret is for those that fear Him, and He has made his covenant known to them”;
[R. Eliezer] said to him,
Go and tell them,
Do not be concerned about your tally, I have received a tradition from R. Yochanan ben Zakai, who heard from his teacher, and his teacher from his teacher until it was a law transmitted to Moses at Sinai, that Ammon and Moab must give the poor man’s tithe in the Sabbatical year.
What is the reason?
Many cities were conquered by those who came up from Egypt, which were not conquered by those who came up from Babylon; since the first consecration held [only] for the time, but did not hold for the future [permanently], therefore they were left in order that the poor might be sustained upon them in the seventh year. 
It is taught:
When his mind was calmed, he said:
May it be granted that Jose's sight be restored [i.e. may he see the errors of his understanding]. And it was restored [i.e. and he did and corrected it].
Our Rabbis have taught,
What is a "shoteh" [translated until now as a mentally ill person]?
He who goes out alone at night, and he who sleeps in a cemetery, and he who tears his clothes.
It is stated: R. Hunna said,
So long as they all take place at one time.
R. Yochanan said,
Even [only] one of them.
What is this case?
If he have done them in the way of folly, even one [is enough to declare him a mentally ill person].
If he have not done them in the way of folly, even [doing] all of them are not [enough to declare him a mentally ill person].
Really, [then] he had done them in the way of folly [and all three together]. [They can't be individually indicative of a mentally ill person, because they could have excuses for why they did it.] One who sleeps in a cemetery does so, it could be said, so that there may rest upon him a spirit of uncleanness. One who goes out alone at night does so, it could be said, so that that the Gandrippus has seized him. One who tears his clothes does so, it could be said, because he is a thinker [and he was lost in thought].
Once he does all of these

Daf 4a

they are like [the ox] that has gored an ox, a donkey, and a camel, and has been made a precedent of warning to all.
R. Papa said, 
Had R. Hunna heard that which was taught in a Baraita:
"What is the definition of a "shoteh"? One who destroys all that is given to him," he would have retracted.
They asked [in the house of study]: 
When [we say] he would have retracted, would he have retracted only regarding one who tears his clothes, because of its similarity [to the above description], or perhaps he would have retracted for all of them?
Let it stand [unanswered, for we do not know].
And one of doubtful gender and one of double gender etc.
Our Rabbis have taught:
"Male" is to exclude the women; "YOUR males" is to exclude the one of doubtful gender and the one double gender. "ALL your males" is to include the children.
The master had said,
"Male is to exclude the women."
But why do I need this verse [to teach me something I know already]?
Let's examine this: This is a positive commandment in which the time determines. And all positive commandments in which the time determines, women are exempt! [Thus, we don't need to learn this from the verse.]
[The verse] is needed.
You might have thought
We should learn "appearing"/"appearing" [scriptural connection] from Hakhel:
Just as in the latter case, women are obligated [to come to Hakhel], so too here, women [should be] obligated. We learn from this [verse that this is not so].
The master had said, 
"Your males" is to exclude the one of doubtful gender and the one of double gender.
It makes sense for one of double gender that this was necessary, for you might have thought that
since he has an aspect of masculinity, he should be obligated. We learn from this that he is a case unto himself. But one of doubtful gender, this is a doubt [on our part what the Torah considers him/her]. Is the verse needed to remove that doubt?
Abaye said,
[Yes,] when his testicles are on the outside [of his body and therefore he has an aspect of masculinity as well].
The master had said,
"All your males" is to include the children [in the obligation].
But doesn't it teach in a Mishnah, Except a deaf man, a mentally ill person and a child?
Abaye said, There is no difficulty.
One case is regarding a child who has reached the age for education, the other regarding a child who has not reached the age for education.
[We learn this from a biblical verse?] A child who has reached the age for education is [only obligated] on a rabbinic level!
Indeed this is so. The expression [therefore] is a mere supporting peg [to the rabbinic obligation].
Then what does the verse come [to teach]?
For like that of Acherim.
For it was taught, Acherim say,
The cordwainer and the smelter in bronze and the tanner are exempt from the appearance [at the Temple], because it is said (Exodus 23:17) "all your males," - he who is able to go up with all your males. To the exclusion of these who are not fit to go up with all your males.
Women and slaves who are not freed etc.
It makes sense regarding women, as we have said [from the verse], but slaves how do we know [they are exempt]?
R. Hunna says,
The verse says (Exodus 23:17) "before the Master, God" - he who has but one master. To the exlusion of this [slave] who has another master.
But why do I need this verse [to teach me something I know already]?
Let's see. Every commandment a woman is obligated in, a slave is obligated in, and every commandment a woman is not obligated in, a slave is not obligated in, for we learn [an exegetical connection] of "unto her"/"unto her" from the woman! [What purpose then is the verse above about "master"?]
Ravina said,
It is only needed for one who is half a slave and half free.
One can be precise as well [and see it] in the Mishnah:
"Women and slaves who are not freed..." What is the meaning of "who are not freed?"
If one would say he is not freed at all, let it just teach plainly "slaves".
Rather, no,
It means those who are not freed completely. And who are those? He who is half a slave and half free. Learn from this
And the lame man and the blind man and the sick man and the old man.
Our Rabbis have taught,
(Exodus 23:14) "footgoing times" excludes people with wooden legs.
Another explanation is,
"Footgoing times" excludes the lame man,
and the sick man, and the blind man, and the old man, and the one who is not able to go up on his feet.
And the one who is not able to go up on his feet, what does this include?
Rava said,
It is to include

Daf 4b

the delicately nurtured, as it is written, (Isaiah 1:12) "When you come to appear before Me, who has required this at your hand, to trample my courts?"
It was taught in a Baraita,
The uncircumcised person and the ritually unclean person are exempt from the "appearing."
It is understandable regarding a ritually unclean person, for it is written, (Deuteronomy 12:5-6) "And there you shall come... and there you shall bring." All who belong to the category of coming are in the category of bringing, and all who do not belong to the category of coming do not belong to the category of bringing.
But the uncircumcised person, how do we know [he is exempt]?
Behold, who is [the opinion of this Baraita]? R. Akiva who includes an uncircumcised person [in the category of] a ritually unclean person.
For it was taught, R. Akiva says,
(Leviticus 22:4) "Each man" (ish ish) [in the context of who cannot eat the sacrifices] is to include the uncircumcised person.
Our Rabbis have taught,
The ritually unclean person is exempt from the "appearing," for it is written, (Deuteronomy 12:5-6) "And there you shall come... and there you shall bring." All who belong to the category of coming are in the category of bringing, and all who do not belong to the category of coming do not belong to the category of bringing.
R. Yochanan ben Dahabai says in the name of R. Yehudah,
He who is blind in one eye is exempt from the "appearing", as it is said, (Exodus 23:17) "He shall be seen" or "He shall see." As he went to see, so he went to be seen; just as he went to be seen with both eyes, so too to see with both eyes.
R. Huna, when he came upon this passage "he shall be seen," "he shall see," wept. He said,
Should a servant, whose master is looking out to see him, distance himself from him? 
As it is written, (Isaiah 1:2) "When you come to appear before me, who has required this at your hand, to trample my courts?"
R. Huna, when he came upon this passage, wept,
(Deuteronomy 27:7) "and you shall sacrifice peace offerings and shall eat there..." Should a servant, whose master is looking out for him to eat at his table, distance himself from him?
For it is written, (Isaiah 1:11) "Why do I need the multitude of your sacrifices unto me, says God." 
R. Elazar, when he came upon this passage, wept,
(Genesis 45:3) "And his brethren could not answer him; for they shook at his presence."
If this is [the effect of] the rebuke of flesh and blood, how much more so the rebuke of the Holy One, blessed be He!
R. Elazar, when he came upon this passage, wept,
(I Samuel 28:15) "Samuel said to Saul, Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?'"
If this was Samuel the righteous being afraid at the [final] judgment, how much more should we be!
Samuel, what is it [that indicates he was afraid of the final judgement]?
As it is written (I Samuel 28:13) "And the woman said unto Saul, I saw divine [figures] coming up (olim)." "Olim" implies [as a plural word] two. Samuel was one, and there was another, for Samuel went and brought Moses with him.
He said to him,
Perhaps, God forbid, we are wanted for the judgement; rise with me, for there is nothing that you have written in the Torah, which I have not kept.
R. Ami, when he came upon this passage, wept,
(Lamentations 3:29) "Let him bury his face in the dust -- there perhaps ("ulay") there is hope." He said,
"All this [suffering], and "ulay " - perhaps?"
R. Ami, when he came upon this passage, wept,
(Zephaniah 2:3) "...Seek righteousness; seek humility; perhaps ("ulay") you will be hidden on the day of the anger of God." He said,
"All this [to be done] and "ulay" - perhaps?"
R. Assi, when he came upon this passage, wept,
(Amos 5:15) "Hate the evil and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate; perhaps ("ulay") God, the God of hosts, [will be gracious]." All this, and "ulay" - perhaps?
R. Joseph, when he came upon this passage, wept,
(Proverbs 13:23) "But there is that which is destroyed without judgment." He said,
"Is there something that is taken before its time?
Indeed, like that of R. Bibi bar Abaye. He had happened upon the Angel of Death.
[The angel] said to his attendant,
Go, bring me Miriam of Magdala, the women's hairdresser.
He went and brought him Miriam of Magdala, the tender of children.
He said to him,
I said to you Miriam of Magdala, the women's hairdresser.
He said to him,
If so, I will bring her back.
He said to him,
Since you have brought her, let her be included.
But how were you able [to get hold of her, since it was not yet her time]? 
She was holding the poker in her hand, and was stooping down

Daf 5a

 and clearing out the stove.
She took it and put it upon her foot and was burned, and her constellation moved, and I brought her.
R. Bibi bar Abaye said to him,
Do you have permission to do such a thing?
He said to him,
And is it not written, "There is that which is destroyed without judgement"?
[R. Bibi] said to him,
But it is [also] written, (Ecclesiastes 1:4) "One generation goes, and another generation comes" [- each in their own time]!
[The angel] said,
I shepherd them, till their generation is filled, and then I hand them over to Dumah.
He said to him,
But in the end, what have you done with the years [you took away from them]?
He said,
If there is a young rabbi, who forgives his treatment [at the hands of others], I add them to him, and it's an exchange.
R. Yochanan, when he came upon this passage, wept,
(Job 2:3) "And you incite Me against him to ruin him without any reason." A slave, whose master is incited against him, and he allows it, is there any help for him?
R. Yochanan,
when he came upon this passage, wept,
(Job 15:15) "Behold, He doesn't trust His holy ones." If He doesn't trust His holy ones, in whom will He trust?
One day, he was walking in the way. He saw a certain man, who was gathering figs. He was leaving what were ripe, and gathering what were not ripe. 
He said to him,
Aren't these [ripe ones] much better ?
He said to him,
I need them for a journey. These [unripe ones] will keep and the others will not keep.
He said,
This is what is written, "Behold, He doesn't trust His holy ones ."
Is this so?
Yet there once was a certain student who was in the neighborhood of R. Alexandre, and died while still young, and [R. Alexandre] said,
"If this one of the rabbis had wanted [to lead a righteous life], he would have lived;
or perhaps he was one of those "He doesn't trust His holy ones";
[However, he is not one of God's holy ones, for] he used to kick against his teachers."
R. Yochanan, when he came upon this passage, wept,
(Malachi 3:5) "Then I will draw near to you for judgment. I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, against the adulterers, against those who swear falsely, against those who defrauds the hired worker of his wages..." A slave whose master drags him to his judgment and hastens to testify against him, is there any help for him?
R. Yochanan ben Zakkai said,
Alas for us, for Scripture equates the light [commandments] like the heavy [commandments, for we see sorcerers and adulterers equated to those who withhold wages from employees].
Resh Lakish said,
All who turns aside justice for the sojourner is as though he turned aside justice for God; for it is said (Malachi 3:5) "turned aside the sojourner," written as "turned Me aside."
R. Chanina bar Papa said,
Anyone who does something and regrets it is forgiven immediately, as it is said, (Malachi 3:5) "and they do not fear Me." Implying, if they do "fear Me," they are forgiven immediately.
R. Yochanan, when he came upon this passage, wept,
(Ecclesiastes 12:14) "For God shall bring every work into judgment concerning every hidden thing." A slave, whose master equates accidental sins with intentional sins, is there any help for him?
What does "concerning every hidden thing" [refer to]?
Rav said,
This [refers to] the man who kills a louse in the presence of his fellow, and he is disgusted [at his fellow] through it.
And Samuel said,
This means the man who spits in the presence of his fellow, and he is disgusted.
What "whether it is good or bad" [refer to, that even a good action will be judged harshly]?
The house of R. Yannai say,
This is someone that gives charity to a poor man publicly. Because of what [occurred to] R. Yannai. He saw a man who gave a coin to a poor man publicly. He said to him,
It would have been better not to give it to him now, for you've given it to him and embarrassed him.
The house of R. Shila say,
This is someone that gives charity to a woman secretly, because he brings her into suspicion.
Rava said,
This someone that sends home to his wife meat that was not cut [properly to take out the fats and other non-kosher parts] on the eves of the Sabbaths.
But Rava [himself] sent home [in this way].
The daughter of R. Chisda was different, for had established her as being an expert.
R. Yochanan, when he came upon this passage, wept,
(Deuteronomy 31:21) "And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles have come upon them." A slave, whose master brings upon him evils and troubles, is there any help for him?
What does "evils and troubles" [refer to]?
Rab said,
Evils which become troubles this for that, as in the case of the wasp [during the cold season] and the scorpion [during the hot season].
But Samuel said,
This [verse above of good actions that are judged harshly refers to] someone who bestows money upon the poor man in the hour of his extreme distress [and not before that point].
Rava said,
This is the proverb, Money [to buy] produce, it is not there.
To [buy] produce [in a time of distress] that is hung, it is there. (Deuteronomy 31:17) "Then My anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide My face from them." R. Bardala bar Tavyumi said in the name of Rav,
Anyone who is not included in the "hiding of the face" is not of them [who are Jewish]; anyone who is not included in the words "and they shall be devoured"

Daf 5b

 is not of them [who are Jewish].
The rabbis said to Rava,
Master [you] are not included in the "hiding of the face," and not included in the "devouring"!
He said to them,
How did you know how much I send out secretly to king Shabor?
And the rabbis continued to put their eyes upon him.
In the meanwhile, messengers from the house of king Shabor came and seized [his property from] him.
He said, this is what the Baraita taught:
Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said,
Any place upon which wise men have put their eyes is either death or distress. 
(Deuteronomy 31:18) "And I will surely hide my face in that day." Rava said,
The Holy One, blessed be He, said,
Even if I hide My face from them, I will speak by a dream.
R. Yosef said,
His hand is stretched out over us, as it is said, (Isaiah 51:16) "And I have covered you in the shadow of My hand."
R. Yehoshua ben Chanania was in the house of the Caesar. A [Christian] heretic showed him [a hand signal symbolizing a quote from his Bible]
"A people whose Master had turned His face from them."
He [answered by] showing him [a hand signal symbolizing a quote from Scripture]
"His hand stretched out over us."
The Caesar said to Rabbi Yehoshua,
What did he show you?
He replied, "A people whose Master has turned away His face from them," and I showed him
"His hand stretched out over us."
They said to that [Christian] heretic,
What did you show him?
"A people whose Master had turned away His face from them."
And what did he show you?
I don't know.
They said,
A man who does not know what he is shown by a signal, shall he [interpret] signals before a king?
They took him out and executed him.
When the soul of R. Yehoshua ben Chanania was departing, the rabbis said to him,
What will become of us [to protect us] from the [Christian] heretics?
He said to them,
(Jeremiah 49:7) "Has counsel been lost from the sons, has their wisdom vanished?"
Once counsel has been lost from the sons [i.e. the Jews], wisdom will vanish from the nations of the world.
Alternatively, [I will answer your question] from here, (Genesis 33:12) [Where Esau tells Jacob] "And he said, Let's travel and let's go, and I will go with you."
R. Iyla was going up the ladder of the house of Rabbah bar Shela. He heard a child who was reading, (Amos 4:13) "For, behold, He that forms the mountains and creates the wind, and tells man what his discussion is."
He said,
A slave, whose master tells him his discussion, is there any help for him?
What is, "what his discussion is"?
Rav said,
Even the superfluous talk between a husband and his wife is told to a man at the time of his death.
Is that so?
But Rav Kahane hid himself under Rav's bed and heard him talk and laugh and do his [sexual] needs. He said,
The mouth of Rav is like that of one who has not tasted a cooked dish [and is overcome by desire for it]. He said to him,
Kahane, get out! These are not good manners.
[So if Rav did it, why is it bad?] There is no difficulty.
Here [where Rav flirted with his wife], he needed to appease her. This case [where it's considered a bad thing], he did not need to appease her.
(Jeremiah 13:17) "But if you will not hear it, My soul shall weep in secret places for the pride." R. Shmuel bar Inya in the name of Rav said,
The Holy One, blessed be He, has a place, and its name is "secret places."
What is "for the pride" [referring to]?
R. Shmuel bar Yitzchak said,
For the gloriousness of Israel, which was taken away from them and given to the non-Jews.
R. Samuel bar Nachmani said,
For the gloriousness of the kingdom of heaven.
And is there [such a thing as] weeping before the Holy One, blessed be He [that He would weep]?
But R. Papa said,
There is no [such thing as] depression before the Holy One, blessed be He, as it says, (I Chronicles 16:27) "Honor and majesty are before Him, strength and beauty are in His place."
There is no difficulty.
This one is in the inner area [where divine beings "weeps" in the secret place], this one is in the outer area [where divine beings do not "weep"].
And [is there] no [weeping] in the outer area?
But it is written, (Isaiah 22:12) "And on that day did God, the God of hosts, call for weeping and for mourning and for baldness and for girding with sackcloth."
The destruction of the Temple is different, for for even the angels of peace wept, as it is said, (Isaiah 33:7) "Behold, their valiant ones cry without: the angels of peace weep bitterly."
(Jeremiah 13:17) "Tears will tear and my eyes will run down with tears, because God's flock has been taken captive." R. Elazar said,
Why these three tears?
One for the first Temple, and one for the second Temple, and one for Israel, because they have been exiled from their place.
And some say,
One for the ceasing of Torah [learning].
This is understandable for the one who holds that [a tear] refers to Israel that was exiled, which is what is written "God's flock has been taken captive,"
But for the one who holds [a tear] refers to the ceasing of Torah [learning], what does [he do with] "God's flock has been taken captive"?
[The answer is that] ever since Israel was exiled from their place, there has been no bigger [cause] of ceasing of Torah [learning] than this!
Our Rabbis have taught,
There are three about whom the Holy One, blessed be He, weeps every day
About one who can study the Torah and does not study it, and about one who cannot study the Torah, and does study it, and over a leader who holds himself superior than the community.
Rebbi took the Book of Lamentations and was reading it.
When he came upon this verse, (Lamentations 2:1) "He has cast down from heaven to earth [the splendor of Israel; he has not remembered his footstool in the day of his anger]." [The book] fell from his hands. He said,
From the highest roof to the deepest pit!
Rebbi and R. Chiya were discussing and walking down a road. When they came to a certain place, they said,
[If] there is a member of the rabbinate here, let us go and visit him.
They said,
There is a member of the rabbinate here, and he is blind.
R. Chiya said to Rebbi,
You should stay, and not dishonor your princely [stature]. I will go and visit him.
But he grasped him and went with him.
When they took their leave of him,
he said to them,
You have visited someone who is seen but cannot see. May you behold the One who sees and cannot be seen.
[Rebbi] said to [R. Chiya],
Now see, you would have deprived me of this blessing! They said to him, Where did you hear this [concept that one should be sure to visit rabbis]?
I heard it from the sayings of R. Yaakov.
For R. Yaakov, the leader of Kfar Chetyah, used to visit his teacher every day. When he was old, [the teacher] said to him,
The master need not do this, for the master is not able.
He responded,
Is this a small thing that which is written regarding the rabbis? (Psalms 49:10) "And he shall live on for ever, he shall not see destruction, when he sees wise men die."
If [this is] so, that one who sees wise men in their death shall live; how much more he who sees them in their life!
R. Idi, the father of R. Yaakov bar Idi, was accustomed to spend three months on his journey and one day in the [study] house of Rav.
The rabbis would call him "Of the house of Rav for a day".
He became depressed.
He read about himself, (Job 12:4) "I am one that is a laughing-stock to his fellow..." R. Yochanan said to him,
In your prayers, do not [wish for] the punishment of the rabbis.
R. Jochanan went into the house of study and expounded,
(Isaiah 58:2) "Yet they seek Me every day and delight to know My ways..." Do they seek Him by day, and don't seek Him by night?
Rather, it is to inform you that anyone who studies Torah even one day of the year, Scripture considers it, as if he studied the whole year.
And so in doling out tribulations, as it is written, (Numbers 14:34) "After the number of the days that you spied out the land." Did they sin for forty years? Was it not for forty days that they sinned?
Rather, it was to inform you,
that anyone who commits a trangression even one day of the year, Scripture considers it as if he had transgressed all the year.
"What is the definition of a child? Anyone who is not able to ride upon his father's shoulders."
Rabbi Zera objected logically to this,

Daf 6a

Who had brought him here until this point?
Abaye said to him,
Until this point, since his mother was obligated by the law of rejoicing, his mother brought him.
From there on, if he can go up, holding his father's hand from Jerusalem to the mountain of the Temple, he is obligated. And if not, he is exempt.
Rabbi replied responded according to the house of Hillel
against the house of Shammai. (I Samuel 1:22) "But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, 'As soon as the child is weaned, I will bring him.'" But Samuel was able to ride upon his father's shoulders!
His father said to him,
And according to your reasoning, there is a difficulty for you. For Hannah herself, was she not obligated in the rejoicing? [Why didn't she go at all herself?]
Rather, Hannah saw Samuel was exceedingly delicate, and was uneasy about Samuel about the fatigue of the journey.
R. Shimon asked,
A child that is lame, according to the words of the house of Shammai, [what would he hold then, since he can ride on his father's shoulders]? Or one that is blind, according to the words of both of them [for he can hold onto his father's hand]?
What case is this?
If you'll say it refers to a lame child who can not [ever be healed and] stretch out [his leg], or a blind person, who can not [ever be healed and] open [his eye], since [we know that] an adult is exempt [in these situations], must we even mention a child [is exempt]? [This is obvious!]
No, it is necessary [because it is not so obvious] regarding a lame person who can [be healed and] stretch out [his leg], or a blind person who can [be healed and] open his eye, [for there are aspects that would make them obligated]. What is [the law regarding them]?
Abaye said,
Wherever an adult is obligated on a Torah level, we educate a child in it also on a rabbinic level. And wherever an adult is exempt on a Torah level, a child is also exempt on a rabbinic level.
The house of Shammai say, the "appearing" involves two pieces of silver, etc.
Our rabbis have taught: The house of Shammai say,
The "appearing" involves two pieces of silver, and the Chagigah a meah of silver,
for the "appearing" [sacrifice] is all-burnt to the Most High, which is not so regarding the Chagigah.
Furthermore,
We find that for Shevuot, Scripture increases the burnt-offerings more than peace-offerings.
But the house of Hillel say,
The "appearing" sacrifices involves a meah of silver and the Chagigah two pieces of silver,
for the [command of sacrificing the] Chagigah precedes the Decalogue, which is not so regarding the "appearing" sacrifice.
Furthermore,
we find regarding "the princes", that Scripture increases peace-offerings for them more than burnt-offerings.
And what is the reason that the house of Hillel do not say like the house of Shammai?
For that which you are saying that the "appearing" [sacrifice] is better, for the burnt-offering goes to the Most High. On the contrary! The Chagigah is better, for there are in it two eatings.
And for that which you are saying, that we should learn from Shavuot, we can compare individual sacrifices [only] to individual sacrifices, and not compare an individual sacrifice to a public sacrifice.
And what is the reason that the house of Shammai do not say like the house of Hillel?
For that which you are saying, that a Chagigah is better, because it precedes the Decalogue, an "appearing" [sacrifice] also precedes the Decalogue!
And for that which you are saying, that we should learn from "the princes," we can compare something that will always apply to a thing that will always apply, and we can not compare a thing which will always apply to a thing which will not always apply.
And [according to] the house of Hillel, what is the difference [that they differentiated the "appearing" sacrifice and the Chagigah]? The Chagigah precedes the Decalogue, for it is written (Exodus 24:5) "and they sacrificed sacrifices of peace-offerings." But the "appearing" sacrifice also! Behold, it is written, (Exodus 24:5) "and they offered burnt-offerings."
The house of Hillel is holding
that the burnt-offering which Israel offered in the wilderness was the continual burnt-offering.
And the house of Shammai is holding
that the burnt-offering which Israel offered in the wilderness was an "appearing" sacrifice.
Abaye said,
The house of Shammai and R. Elazar and R. Yishmael all hold
that the burnt-offering which Israel offered in the wilderness was an "appearing" sacrifice.
And the house of Hillel and R. Akiva and R. Yose the Galilean all hold
that the offering which Israel offered in the wilderness was the continual burnt-offering.
[We know these positions from various sources.] The house of Shammai, as we have said. R. Yishmael, for it was taught in a Baraita: R. Yishmael says,
General principles were told over at Sinai,

Daf 6b

and the details in the tent of meeting. But R. Akiva said,
[Both the] general principles and details were told over at Sinai, and they were repeated in the tent of meeting, and given for the third time in the plains of Moav.
And if you would imagine that the burnt-offering which Israel offered in the desert was the continual burnt-offering, is it something which at first does not need to be flayed and cut, and in the end did need to be flayed and cut? [The regular sacrifices need these details when they are first commanded! So the continual burnt-offering must have been commanded first at the tent of meeting, and not before the Decalogue at Sinai, because it needs the details along with the general principles. The "appearing" sacrifice did not need these details and surely was given before the Decalogue.]
[We know the same position is held by] R. Elazar, for it was taught in a Baraita,
(Numbers 28:6) "Continual burnt-offering, instituted at Mount Sinai." R. Elazar says,
Its statutes were told over at Mount Sinai, but it was not itself offered. R. Akiva says,
It was offered and never ceased.
But how do I satisfy [the description in the verse that implies they did not sacrifice in the desert], (Amos 5:25) "Did you bring to me sacrifices and offerings during the forty years in the desert, O house of Israel?" [The explanation is that that verse refers to] the tribe of Levi, which had not served idols, they offered them.
[The position held by] the house of Hillel is as we have said.
[This same position is held by] R. Akiva, as we also have said.
[This same position is held by] R. Yose the Galilean, as was taught in the Baraita: R. Yose the Galilean says,
Three commandments are Israel commanded by when they make the pilgrimage on the festival:
The "appearing", and the Chagigah, and the rejoicing.
There is something about the "appearing" that is not so for the [other] two, and there something about the Chagigah that is not so for the [other] two, and there something about the rejoicing that is not so for the [other] two.
There is something about the "appearing" that is not so for the [other] two, for the "appearing" is a wholly burnt up to the Most High, which is not so for the [other] two.
There something about the rejoicing that is not so for the [other] two, for the Chagigah precedes the Decalogue, which is not so for the other two.
There something about the rejoicing that is not so for the [other] two, for the rejoicing applies to women as well as men, which is not the case in the [other] two.
And why are you establishing R. Yishmael like the [opinion of the] house of Shammai?
And if you would imagine that the burnt-offering which Israel offered in the desert was the continual burnt-offering, is it something which at first does not need to be flayed and cut, and in the end did need to be flayed and cut?
But R. Yose the Galilean said, The burnt- offering which Israel offered in the desert was the continual burnt-offering, which [indeed] at first did not need to be flayed and cut, but in the end did need to be flayed and cut.
For it was taught in a Baraita, R. Yose the Galilean says,
The burnt-offering which Israel offered in the desert did not require flaying or cutting, because flaying and dividing were only from [the time of] the tent of meeting and on! [R. Yishmael could hold like that position.]
Erase R. Yishmael from here.
R. Chisda asked,
What does this verse mean?
(Exodus 24:5) "And he sent young men of the people of Israel, who offered burnt offerings," - [referring to] lambs, "and sacrificed peace-offerings of oxen to God." Or perhaps both of them were oxen?
What is the practical import [from such a question]?
Mar Zutra says, How the accents are determined [for how to read the Torah].
R. Acha, the son of Rava, said,
For [the case of] a man who says, Behold, I vow a burnt-offering like the burnt-offering which Israel offered in the desert.
What was it? Were they oxen or lambs?
Let the matter stand [for we do not know the answer].
It was taught there: These are the things that have no limit,

Daf 7a

the corner of a field [left over for the poor], and the first-fruits, and the "appearing", and loving-kindness, and the study of Torah.
R. Yochanan said,
We used to think that the "appearing" had no maximum, but it had an minimum [of what could be brought],
until R. Oshaya b'Rebbi came and taught:
The "appearing" maximum nor minimum amount [i.e. one can bring however much they want].
But the sages say,
The "appearing" involves a meah of silver, but the Chagigah two pieces of silver.
What is the "appearing"?
R. Yochanan said,
The presenting of oneself [lit. the "seeing of faces"] in the courtyard [of the Temple]. And Resh Lakish said,
The presenting of oneself [specifically] with a sacrifice.
Everyone agrees that during the essential [days] of the festival [i.e. the first day], ["appearing" means] presenting oneself with a sacrifice. When they argue, is in regards to the rest of the days of the festival.
Everyone agrees that any case where he came and brought [a sacrifice], that it would be accepted [as an offering]. When they argue, is in regards to someone who came and didn't bring [a sacrifice].
For R. Yochanan holds
that [the "appearing" is] the presenting of oneself in the courtyard, that he doesn't need to bring [a sacrifice] every time he comes.
And Resh Lakish says,
that [the "appearing" is] the presenting oneself with a sacrifice, that he needs to bring [a sacrifice] every time he comes.
Resh Lakish rebutted R. Yochanan [using a higher source],
(Exodus 23:15) "None shall appear before Me empty-handed." [This shows one must bring a sacrifice when he comes!]
He said to him,
[Yes, but only] on the essential [day] of the festival [i.e. the first day].
He rebutted him [using a higher source].
"None shall appear before me empty-handed" refers to [coming with] Zevachim [animal sacrifices]. You may say, is it [truly] with Zevachim or only birds and meal-offerings?
It is a logical argument [to determine it is zevachim].
The Chagigah is assigned to a regular person, but the "appearing" is assigned to the Most High. Just as the Chagigah, which is assigned to a regular person, is done with zevachim [animal sacrifices which are the superior sacrifice], so too the "appearing", which is assigned to the Most High, is done with zevachim.
And what are these zevachim? They are burnt-offerings.
You may say, is it [truly] burnt-offerings, or [only] peace-offerings?
It is a logical argument [to determine it is burnt-offerings].
The Chagigah is assigned to a regular person, but the "appearing" is assigned to the Most High. Just as the Chagigah, which is assigned to a regular person, is done as appropriate for him [to eat from], so too the "appearing", which is assigned to the Most High, is done as appropriate for Him [to "eat" from].
And it is also logical that your table should not be full while your master's table is empty.
He said to him,
[Yes, but only] on the essential [day] of the festival [i.e. the first day].
He rebutted him [using a higher source].
R. Yose b'Rabbi Yehudah says,
Israel was commanded to do a pilgrimage on the festival three times a year:
The festival of Pesach, the Festival of Shavuot, and the festival of Sukkot.
They may not appear "halved", as it is said, "all your males," and they may not appear empty-handed, as it is said, "none shall appear before Me empty-handed." [We see, therefore, that the obligation of making the pilgrimage involved bringing a sacrifice as well!]
He said to him,
[Yes, but only] on the essential [day] of the festival [i.e. the first day].
R. Yochanan rebutted Resh Lakish [using a higher source].
"He shall see" - "He shall be seen" - Just like I [God come to see you] freely [without a sacrifice], so too you [come to be seen] freely [without a sacrifice].
[This is a solid rebuttal, and therefore our distinctions previously set out are incorrect.] Rather,
Everyone agrees that any case where he came and didn't bring [a sacrifice], that he may enter, be seen, and leave. When they argue, is in regards to someone who came and did bring [a sacrifice].
R. Yochanan, who says that [the obligation of "appearing" is] presenting oneself in the courtyard [of the Temple]
[holds that] presenting oneself is that which doesn't have a limit. But the sacrifice has a limit [to when it can be brought].
And Resh Lakish says,
[that the obligation of "appearing" is] the presenting of oneself with a sacrifice [holds that] even the sacrifice also has no limit [to when it can be brought].
He rebutted him [using a higher source].
(Proverbs 25:17) "Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor’s house." [This refers to the "regel" as in festival, and means that one should lessen the amount of "appearing" sacrifices. So there is a limit!]
There [that verse] refers to sin-offerings and guilt-offerings [that one should try to lessen]. Like that of R. Levi. That R. Levi raised a contradiction:
It is written, "Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor’s house." Yet it is written, (Psalms 66:13) "I will come into Your house with burnt offerings." [We see that increased amount of sacrifices is a good thing.
There is no difficulty.
Here [in Proverbs] it refers to sin-offerings and guilt-offerings. Here [in Psalms] it refers to burnt-offerings and peace-offerings.
It was taught similarly in a Baraita:
"Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor’s house." - Referring to sin-offerings and guilt-offerings. Does Scripture refer [only] to sin-offerings and guilt-offerings, or only to burnt-offerings and peace-offerings?
When he says, "I will come into Your house with burnt offerings; I will fulfill my vows to You," behold, that is referring to burnt-offerings and peace-offerings. But how do I fulfill, "Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor’s house"? Scripture refers to burnt-offerings and peace-offerings
And they may not appear "halved" etc.
R. Yosef [originally] thought to say,
A man has ten sons, they may not to go up five now and five tomorrow.

Daf 7b

Abaye said to him,
Obviously! Which ones would you consider sinners and which ones would you consider devout? [If some sons travel the day before, the others will be considered less religiously impassioned.]
Rather for what [lesson] is the verse coming [to teach]? Like that of Acherim.
For Acherim say,
The cordwainer, and the smelter in bronze and  the tanner are exempt from the "appearing", for it is said, "all your males " - one who can go up with all your males. These are excluded, for they cannot go up with all your males.
MISHNAH. Burnt-offerings during the intermediary days of the festival come from unconsecrated funds, but the peace-offerings [even] from the [second] tithe.
The first day of Pesach: The house of Shammai say
[the sacrifices come] from unconsecrated funds. And the house of Hillel say
that they come [even] from the [second] tithe.
Israelites fulfill their duty with vows and freewill-offerings and with tithe of cattle, and the kohanim with the sin-offerings, and with the guilt-offerings, and with the firstborn [sacrifices], and with the breast and thigh, but not by the birds or of meal-offerings.
GEMARA. But [the Mishnah stated] that it is the intermediate days of the festival that come from unconsecrated funds; implying that the [first and last] festival days come from the tithe! [But] why?
It is an obligatory [sacrifice], and any obligatory [sacrifice] only comes from unconsecrated funds!
And if you'll claim,
this comes to teach us [something completely different], that burnt-offerings [of the "appearing"] are brought on the intermediary days of the festival, but not brought on the [first and last] festival days, who does that accord with? The house of Shammai.
That it was taught in a Mishnah:
The house of Shammai say,
They bring peace-offerings and do not lean on them, but not burnt-offerings.
And the house of Hillel say,
They bring peace-offerings and burnt-offerings and lean on them. [Our Mishnah would not have its plain statements to be in accordance with the house of Shammai, who we have decided against in most matters!]
There is [text] missing, and this is how it should be taught:
Burnt-offerings, vows and freewill-offerings are brought on intermediary days of the festival, but not on the [first and last] festival days. And the "appearing" sacrifice is brough even on the [first and last] festival days.
And when it is brought, it is only brought from unconsecrated funds.
And peace-offerings for the rejoicing are brought even from the tithe.
And the Chagigah of the first festival day: The house of Shammai say,
From unconsecrated funds,
but the house of Hillel say,
From the tithe.
It was taught in a Baraita similarly:
Burnt-offerings, vows and freewill-offerings are brought on the intermediary days of the festival. On the [first and last] festival days, they are not brought,
but the "appearing" sacrifice is brought even on the [first and last] festival days.
And when it is brought, it is only brought from unconsecrated funds.
And peace-offerings for the rejoicing are brought even from the tithe.
And the Chagigah of the first festival day: The house of Shammai say,
From unconsecrated funds, but the house of Hillel say,
From the tithe.
What is different about the Chagigah for the first festival day of Pesach [that it should be mentioned separately]?
R. Ashi said,
This is coming to teach us that this is true for the Chagigah of the fifteenth day [that you can take from unconsecrated funds]. This is not true for the Chagigah of the fourteenth.

Daf 8a

We see he is holding that
the Chagigah of the fifteenth day is not a Torah law.
The master had said,
The house of Hillel say,
[The first and last festival day sacrifices come] from the tithe.
[But] why?
It is an obligatory [sacrifice], and any obligatory [sacrifice] only comes from unconsecrated funds!
Ulla said,
[It can come from the tithe] in the case of supplementing [the unconsecrated funds]. 
Chizkiya said,
They may supplement animals with an animals, but they may not supplement money with money. 
And R. Yochanan said,
They may supplement money with money, but they may not supplement animals with animals.
It was taught in a Baraita like R. Hezekiah, and it was taught in a Baraita like R. Yochanan.
It was taught in a Baraita like R. Yochanan:
(Deuteronomy 16:10) "The tribute [of the freewill-offering]." - teaches that one must bring his duty offering from unconsecrated funds. How do we know that if he wants to mix, he can mix [specifically referring to money]? It teaches us
(Deuteronomy 16:10) "As God your God blesses you." [All of God's blessings to you, and "blessing" refers to money.]
It was taught in a Baraita like R. Chizkiya:
(Deuteronomy 16:10) "The tribute [of the freewill-offering]." - teaches - The word "tribute" teaches that one must bring his duty offering from unconsecrated funds. The house of Shammai say,
The first [festival] day, from unconsecrated funds. From then and on, from the tithe.
And the house of Hillel say,
The first meal, from unconsecrated funds. From then and on from the tithe.
And all the rest of the days of Pesach a man fulfills his obligation with the animal tithe.
Why not on the [first and last days of the] festival?
R. Ashi said,
Perhaps he will come to tithe on the [first and last days of the] festival, and it is not possible to tithe on [the first and last days of] the festival because of red paint [that one might use and forget it is a violation of the festival].
How does "tribute" imply a connotation of unconsecrated funds [that one can learn out that we can use unconsecrated funds]?
As it is written, (Esther 10:1) "And King Achashverosh put a tribute upon the land."
"Israelites fulfill their obligations with vows and freewill- offerings."
The rabbis have taught in a Baraita:
(Deuteronomy 16:14) "And you shall rejoice in your festival." To include all types of joy for rejoicing.
From here the sages have said,
Israelites fulfill their obligations with vows and freewill- offerings and with animal tithes, and the kohanim with sin-offerings and guilt-offerings, and with the firstborn sacrifice, and with the breast and thigh.
One might [think] also with birds and meal-offerings, the Torah teaches, "And you shall rejoice in your festival"

Daf 8b

["b'chagecha" indicates] things that the Chagigah can be brought from, excluding these, that the Chagigah can't be brought from.
R. Ashi said,
It is derived from "and you shall rejoice," excluding these, that do not have rejoicing in them [because they are not true meat].
And what does R. Ashi do with "in your festival" ["b'chagecha"]?
That is to accord with that of R. Daniel bar Katina.
For R. Daniel bar Katina said in the name of Rav,
How do we know that we don't marry women during the intermediary days of the festival? Because it is said, (Deuteronomy 16:14) "and you shall rejoice in your festival," - and not in your wife [so stay away from creating this happiness at this time which is for happiness in the festival].
MISHNAH. One who has many dependents and few assets, should bring many peace offerings and few burnt offerings.
[One who has] many assets and few dependents, should bring many burnt offerings and few peace offerings.
[If one has] few of both, of him it is stated: A <em>ma'ah</em> of silver and two pieces of silver.
[If one has] many of both, of him it is stated: "Each man as he is able, according to the Lord your God's blessing that He gave you" [Deuteronomy 16:17].
GEMARA. Where will he bring "many peace offerings"?
But [the case states that] he doesn't have [to pay for full animal peace offerings]!
R. Chisda said,
He supplements [and mixes his tithe funds and his unconsecrated funds together], and brings a large bullock.
R. Sheshet said to him,
Behold, they say, They may [only] supplement animals with animals!
What was [R. Sheshet] saying to him [with this objection]?
If you'll say he meant this:
"Behold, they say, They may [only] supplement animals with animals, but not money with money," then he should have said to him,
"They do not supplement money with money."
Rather this is what he said to him:
Behold, they say, They may even supplement animals with animals! [The objection being is that you, R. Chisda, implied that one may only mix monies, but you can even mix animal funds!]
Who is this like? For it is not like Chizkiya, and it is not like R. Yochanan.
And if you'll say, it is an argument among Amoraim [i.e. R. Sheshet and R. Chisda], but the Mishnaic teachers do not argue, but it is taught,
"The first meal shall come from unconsecrated funds."
What is "the first meal"? The money equivalent of the first meal shall come from unconsecrated funds.
Ulla said in the name of Resh Lakish,
If one sets apart ten animals for his Chagigah, he may bring five on the first day of the festival, and may again bring five on the last day of the festival.
R. Yochanan said,
Once he stops [after five], he cannot bring again [another five later because he fulfilled the Chagigah already].
R. Abba said,
And they aren't arguing.
Here is with inexplicit [separating them for sacrifices, and one may not sacrifice the last half later], here is explicitly [separating them, and one may sacrifice the last half later].
Inexplicit [separation], what is that case [that he left half of them over for later]?
If you'll say [the reason he didn't bring half of them is because] there was not enough time in the day to bring them, that means they weren't brought because there was not enough time in the day [and he ostensibly separated them for the first day].
If you'll say [the reason he didn't bring half of them is because] there were no more dependents [to eat his food], that means that they weren't brought because he didn't have dependants [and he did separate them for the first day].
No, it is necessary for the case where there was enough time during the day, and he had enough dependents,
he [just] did not bring them at the earlier time. Learn from this that he left them behind [intentionally].
And this also makes sense, for when Rabbin came he said in R. Yochanan's name,
If one sets apart ten animals for his Chagigah, he may bring five on the first day of the festival, and may again bring five on the last day of the festival.
These [traditions of what R. Yochanan held] contradict each other!
Rather, do we not learn from this
that here [this statement of R. Yochanan where one may not bring half at one time and half at another] refers to inexplicit [separation] and here [this statement of R. Yochanan where he may] is explicit separation? Learn from it.
It is also stated: R. Shemen bar Abba said in the name of R. Yochanan:

Daf 9a

They taught this only if he had not "finished". But if he had finished, he should go back and sacrifice.
What does "finished" mean?
If you'll say, that he has finished sacrificing, what is he [going back and] sacrificing?
Rather, that the day hadn't finished. But if the day had finished, he should go back and sacrifice [later].
MISHNAH. If one failed to celebrate [by bringing the burnt and peace offerings] during the first festival day [of Sukkot], one may celebrate during the entire festival and during the last festival day [of Sukkot].
If the festival passed and one failed to celebrate, one is not obligated to compensate. About this it is stated: "A crooked thing that cannot be fixed, and a loss cannot be reckoned" [Ecclesiastes 1:15]....
Rabbi Shimon ben Menassia says: 
What is "a crooked thing that cannot be fixed"? This applies to one who had relations with a forbidden woman and fathers a <em>mamzer</em> through her.
If you would say [the verse refers to] a thief or a robber, he can return it and make amends.
Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai says:
One is only called "crooked" if he was proper at first and became crooked; and who is that?
A Torah scholar who separates from Torah.
GEMARA. What is the source for these words [that one can make up for a missed sacrifice til the last day of the festival of Sukkot]? 
R. Yochanan said in the name of R. Yishmael,
"Atzeret" is used [in the Torah] regarding the seventh day of Pesach, and "atzeret" is used [in the Torah] regarding the eighth day of Sukkot. Just like the former has a "make up" period [of seven days], so too the latter has a "make up" period [of seven days].
["Atzeret" must be] free [as a redundant word in the verse to make it a true incontrovertible gezeira shava]. For if it were not free, one could confute [this interpretation by pointing out a difference between the cases that would not allow a connection based off a simple similarity of words]:
The [particular characteristic of] the seventh day of Pesach,that it is not separated [halachically] from [the days] preceding it, you're going to say that about the eighth day of Sukkot [i.e. Shemini Atzeret], that is separated from [the days] preceding it [halachically]? Truly, it is definitely free [to be considered an incontrovertible gezeira shava].
Let's see [how it is redundant]. What does "atzeret" - "restraint" mean? Restraint from doing [halachically forbidden] work. But isn't it [already] written, (Deuteronomy 16:8) "You shall not do work"? Why does Scripture say that it [is a day of] "atzeret"?
Learn out from this that it is free [for a gezeira shava through its redundancy].
And a Baraita derives it from here, that it was taught:
(Leviticus 23:41) "You shall celebrate it as a festival to God for seven days." One might have thought that one should continually celebrate [by bringing the Chagigah] continually all seven [days], Scripture teaches us "it" - on it [the first day] shall you celebrate [by bringing the Chagigah], and you should not celebrate [by bringing the Chagigah] all seven days.
If so, why does it say "seven" [if the verse teaches something about the first day only]? For the "make up" period.
And how do we know that if he did not celebrate [by bringing the Chagigah] on the first day of the festival, he may go and celebrate  [by bringing the Chagigah] any [day] of the festival and the last day of the festival? Scripture teaches us, (Leviticus 23:41) "In the seventh month you shall celebrate it."
Just from "in the seventh month", one might have thought that one could go and celebrate [by bringing the Chagigah] the entire month.
Scripture teaches us
"It." On it you shall celebrate [by bringing the Chagigah] and you are not to celebrate outside it['s designated days].
What is the [case of] "make up" [sacrifice]?
R. Yochanan says,
"Make ups" are for the first day [if one missed bringing the sacrifice on the first day]. And R. Oshaya says,
"Make ups" are on any [one day] for another.
What [practical difference] is there between them?
R. Zera said,
If a man is lame on the first day and cured on the second day, that's a difference between them.
R. Yochanan said,
"Make ups" are for the first day. Once he was not fit [to bring the sacrifice] on the first day, he is not [considered] fit on the second.
And R. Oshaya said,
"Make ups" are on any [one day] for another.
Even though he was not fit on the first day, he was fit on the second [and is now obligated to make up for what he missed].
Did R. Yochanan say this?
But Chizkiya said,
[A Nazirite,] if [further] made ritually impure on the [eighth] day, brings an [additional offering], but [if he became ritually impure] in the [previous] night, does not bring it.
And R. Yochanan said,
Even [if he became ritually impure] in the [previous] night, he brings it. [We see that if hew could not bring a sacrifice because he was unfit, he can bring it later to make up for it!]
R. Yirmiyah said,
Ritual impurity is different, as there is a "make up" period on Second Pesach [for those who were ritually impure on Pesach itself. We see that everyone agrees that ritual impurity allows for a "make up" later].
R. Pappa attacks logically:
This makes sense according to the one who says that

Daf 9b

Second Pesach is a "make up" period of the first day [of the real Pesach].
But according to the one who says, The second [Pesach] is an independent of its own [and is not a "make up" period for the first], what is there to say [for him about the seemingly contradictory opinions of R. Yochanan]?
Rather, R. Papa said,
R. Yochanana is holding that night is not [considered] missing time [and therefore he is not required to "make up" for being unfit at one time, because its not considered having been late over a night]. 
And does R. Yochanan say this?
But R. Yochanan says,
If he saw [an emission] at night and two in the day, he must bring [an additional offering]. But two at night and one in the day, he doesn't bring it. [This shows that he considers the night a time that he missed out on, and he can't make it up!]
And if you'll imagine that R. Yochanan is holding that the night is not [considered] missing time, then even if there were two at night and one in the day, he should bring!
[The answer is] when R. Yochanan was saying this within the opinion of the one who says "night is missing time".
According to the one who says [that]?
That is obvious [to that opinion that that would be the law]!
[The case of] two in the day and one at night is needed for him who holds [night is missing time, and therefore can't bring an offering to make up for it, because we might have thought something erroneous.] You may have thought, that [the law] is like R. Shisha son of R. Idi's objection (Keritot 8a). It comes to teach us that it is like R. Yosef.
"If the festival passed and he did not celebrate [by bringing the Chagigah], he is not obligated in responsibility [to make it up]. And with regard to this it is said, (Ecclesiastes 1:15) 'That which is crooked cannot be made straight, and that which is deficient cannot be counted.'"
Bar Hey Hey said to Hillel,
"To be counted"?
It should have said, "to be filled" [when we are discussing something deficient]!
Rather, his fellows counted him for doing a commandment [when they tell him, "Come with us to do a commandment!"] and he would not be counted among them [i.e. he refuses to go].
It was taught like this is a Baraita:
"That which is crooked cannot be made straight."
This is one who missed the reading of the Shema of the morning, or the reading of the Shema of the evening, or who has missed the morning prayer or the evening prayer. [He cannot make it up, cannot "make it straight".]
"And that which is deficient cannot be counted." Thishis fellows counted him for doing a commandment [when they tell him, "Come with us to do a commandment!"] and he would not be counted among them [i.e. he refuses to go].
Bar Hey Hey said to Hillel,
What is it that's written, (Malachi 3:18) "Then once more you shall see the distinction between the righteous one and the wicked one, between one who serves God and one who does not serve him"? The "righteous one" and "the one who serves God" are the same, and "the wicked one" and "the one who does not serve God", are the same! [What is the purpose of this repetition?]
He said to him,
"The one who serves God" and "the one who does not serve God" are both [descriptions of] the  completely righteous.
But he who reviews his lessons a hundred times is not like him who reviews his lessons a hundred and one times.
He said to him,
Because one time he is called "one who does not serve God"?!
He said to him,
Indeed! Go and learn from the mule-drivers market
[how they say,] "Ten parasangs for one zuz, eleven parasangs for two zuz!"
Eliyahu said to Bar Hey Hey, and some say to R. Eliezer,
What is it that's written, (Isaiah 48:10) "Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver; I have tried you in the furnace of poverty"? It teaches that the Holy One, blessed be He, searched out all good qualities to give to Israel, and found only poverty.
Shmuel, and some say R. Yosef, said,
This is proverbial saying,
Poverty befits a Jew as red leather to a white horse.
"R. Shimon ben Manassea says,
Who is this, that is "crooked and that cannot be made straight"? This is one who has relations with someone forbidden to him and fathers a <i>mamzer</i> through her."
If he fathers a child, yes [he is considered in this category. If does not father a child, no?
But it was taught in a Baraita: R. Shimon ben Manassea says,
A thief can return his stolen objects, and he can make it straight. A robber can return his robbed objects, and he can make it straight. But he that lies with a married woman, and makes her forbidden to her husband, is barred from the world, and goes away.
R. Shimon ben Yochai says,
One does not say, "Investigate a camel, investigate a pig."
Rather,
"Investigate a lamb" [if it is fit for sacrifice].
And who is this? This is the scholar who has separated himself from the Torah.
R. Yehudah ben Lakish said,
Any scholar who has separated himself from the Torah, about him does Scripture refer, (Proverbs 27:8) "Like a bird that wanders from her nest, so is a man who wanders from his place." and it says, (Jeremiah 2:5) "What wrong did your fathers find in me that they went far from me?"
There is no difficulty [in the words of R. Shimon ben Manassea above].
Here [in our Mishnah] is with his unmarried sister [which causes a mamzer but still permitted to her future husband], the other with a married woman [who causes her to be forbidden from her husband even without causing a mamzer].
Alternatively,
Both cases are with a married woman, and there is no difficulty.
Here [in our Mishnah]

Daf 10a

with rape [where she is not forbidden to her husband afterward], here it's willingly.
Alternatively,
Both are with rape [of a married woman] and there is no difficulty.
Here [the one not in our Mishnah], it is the wife of a kohen [who is forbidden to him even in a case of rape], here [where we are concerned only if it produces a mamzer] is the wife of an ordinary Israelite.
(Zachariah 8:10) "To he who was leaving, abnd he who was coming, there was no peace." Rav says,
Once a person leaves the [study of] law for the [study of] Scripture, he has no more peace.
And Shmuel said,
This is he who deserts the Talmud for Mishnah. And R. Yochanan said,
Even if he go from one order of Talmud to the other.
MISHNAH. [The laws of] permitting [i.e. dissolving] vows are flying in the air, and there is nothing they can lean on.
The laws of the Sabbath, Chagigot [offerings], and misappropriation [of Temple property], behold, they are like mountains suspended by a hair, for the verses are few and the laws many.
Civil law and [Temple] services, the ritually pure and impure, and cases of unlawful unions, they have something to lean on, and these are the body of the Torah.
GEMARA. R. Eliezer says,
[Laws of permitting vows] have something to lean on! For it is said, (Leviticus 27:2) "When he shall make a separating vow," (Numbers 6:2) "When he shall make a separating vow," twice. One is a separation to forbid, and one is to permit.
R. Yehoshua says,
[Laws of permitting vows] have something to lean on! For it is said, (Psalms 95:11) "Which I swore in My wrath." In my wrath I swore, and [after I "calmed down"] I relented. [Implying He swore in wrath, and regretted it and undid the vow.]
R. Yitzchak says,
[Laws of permitting vows] have something to lean on! For it is said, (Exodus 35:5) "Whoever is of a willing heart." [Implying if he becomes unwilling, he may undo his vow]. 
Chananiah, nephew of R. Yehoshua, says,
[Laws of permitting vows] have something to lean on! For it is said, (Psalms 119:106) "I have sworn an oath and confirmed it, to keep your righteous rules." [Implying had He not upheld it, He could have undid the vow.]
R. Yehudah said in the name of R. Shmuel,
If I had been there, I would have said to them,
Mine is much better than yours, for it is said, (Numbers 30:3) "He shall not break his word." He cannot break it, but others can break it for him."
Rava said,
There is an objection to all of them except Shmuel's, which has no objection to it.
For if [the source for permitting vows is] R. Eliezer's, perhaps the [verse are to be read] like that of R. Yehudah, who said in the name of R. Tarfon,
For it was taught in a Baraita, R. Yehudah says in the name of R. Tarfon,
[In a case where two people make a bet where the loser must become a Nazir] really neither of them is a Nazirite, for the state of a Nazirite is only given to one who makes a separating vow [clearly, without conditions. And he interprets the repititious verses thusly].
If [the source for permitting vows is] R. Yehoshua's, perhaps the meaning is this,
"I swore in my wrath," and I will not relent [even when I "calm down." Thus, this is not a proof for the permitting of vows].
If [the source for permitting vows is] R. Yitzchak's, perhaps [that verse is] to exclude that of Shmuel,
for Shmuel said,
One who decides in his heart, he must utter it with his lips. And [this verse] is coming to teach us
that even if he had not uttered it with his lips [it would take effect. This this is not a proof for the permitting of vows.].
If [the source for permitting vows is] Chananiah, nephew of R. Yehoshua, perhaps it is as R. Gidel said in the name of Rav.
For R. Gidel said in the name of Rav,
What is the source that it is a mitzvah to fulfill an oath? As it is said, (Psalms 119:106) "I have sworn an oath and confirmed it, to keep your righteous rules." [Thus this is not a source for permitting vows.]
But Shmuel's [source] has no [opening for] objection.
Rava, and some say R. Nachman bar Yitzchak said,
This is what people say,
Better is one grain of pepper than a basket full of dates.
"Laws of Sabbath." 
But they are surely written [i.e. the laws of the Sabbath are in Scripture]!
No, it is necessary for that of R. Abba 
for R. Abba said,
One who digs a hole on the Sabbath, and he only needs the dirt [but he is not digging for the purpose of the hole itself], he is exempt.
Who is this like? It is like that of R. Shimon, who said,
A work which is not necessary for its own sake is exempt. You could even say this within R. Yehudah['s opinion that you have transgressed the Sabbath for doing an action not for its own sake], there he is fixing [when he does an action not for its own sake and has transgressed], here he is destroying [and therefore he is exempt].
What is "as mountains suspended by a hair"?

Daf 10b

The Torah forbade work [on the Sabbath] of intention, and [the concept of work of intention] is not written.
Chagigot:
But they are surely written [about in Scripture]!
No, it is necessary according to that which R. Papa said to Abaye
Where do we know that "And you shall celebrate it as a festival for God" refers to sacrifices?
Perhaps the Torah meant [simply] celebrate a festival [without a sacrifice]!
Really now? [We know celebration refers to sacrificing] for it is written (Exodus 5:1) "That they may celebrate unto Me in the wilderness"! Indeed, that refers to celebrating as a festival.
But you'll say it does indeed [mean that], but it is written (Exodus 10:25) "But Moses said, 'You must also let us have sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice to God our God.'" [Obviously, the "celebration was the sacrifices indicated here!]
Maybe Scripture is saying,
Eat, drink, and be merry first [and then bring sacrifices, for tomorrow they die]?
Don't imagine that, for it is written (Exodus 23:18) "And do not leave the fat from the celebration until the next morning." And if you would imagine that it refers [merely] to the celebration, does a celebration have fat?
Maybe Scripture is saying,
Fat that is brought during the celebration should not be left over?
Really now?
[Then that would imply] that the fat which comes at the time of a festival cannot be left over. Implying that all that which comes all the rest of the year can be left over? 
It is written, (Leviticus 6:2) "All the night til the morning"! [We already know that!]
Maybe if [we learned this law only] from that one, I would have thought
Scripture wrote this one as a positive command, and that one is a prohibition.
But Scripture wrote one as a prohibition in a different verse.
(Deuteronomy 16:4) "Do not let any of the meat you sacrifice on the evening of the first day remain until morning."
And maybe that [teaches] that one violates two prohibitions and a postive command?
Rather, it is a scriptural connection of "desert"/"desert".
It is written here, "And they shall have a festival for Me in the desert," and it is written there (Amos 5:25) "Did you bring sacrifices (zevachim) and offerings (mincha) to Me in the desert?" Just like the latter refers to zevachim, so too the former refers to zevachim. What does it mean, "mountains hanging by a thread"? For we cannot derive the words of the Torah from the words of the prophets [normally].
"Misappropriation [of Temple property]:
But they are surely written [about in Scripture]!
Rami bar Chama said,
It was only necessary in order to accord with that which was taught in a Mishnah:
[If one sends someone to misappropriate Temple property on his behalf,] if the messenger does his mission, the master [is considered to have] misappropriated. If he does not do his mission, the messenger [is considered to have] misappropriated.
And if he did his mission, why is [the sender considered to have] transgressed?
Can it be that one is the sinner [the messenger] and the other one [the sender] is guilty?
That is like a mountain hanging by a thread!
Rava said,
But what is the difficulty?
Perhaps misappropriation is different, for "sin"/"sin" is derived from Terumah tithing. Just like there, the messenger is is like the person himself [who sent him, in that as long as the person sending is the owner and allowed to separate terumah tithes, so can his messenger], so too here [for misappropriation], a messenger is like the person himself [who sent him]. [Thus, our Mishna isn't needed to teach this non-innovative teaching.]
Rather, Rava said,
It was only necessary in order to accord with that which was taught in a Baraita:
[If one sends someone to misappropriate Temple property on his behalf, and after sending him] the master remembers and the messenger does not remember, the messenger is guilty of misappropriation.
What had the poor messenger done?
That is like a mountain hanging by a thread!
Rav Ashi said,
What is the difficulty? Perhaps it is something of a case of one who takes sacred money for ordinary uses [where, even by mistake, still makes the mistaken party guilty of misappropriation].
Rather, Rav Ashi said,
It was only necessary in order to accord with that which was taught in a Mishnah:
One who takes a stone or a beam of the Temple, behold, he is not guilty of misappropriation. If he hands it to his fellow, he has misappropriated, but his fellow has not misappropriated.
Let's see. Surely has taken it, what do I care if it was him or his fellow?
That is like a mountain hanging by a thread!
And what is the difficulty? Perhaps it is like Shmuel, for Samuel said,
Here

Daf 11a

we are dealing with the [Temple] treasurer who was given stones of the building, that anywhere he puts it down is in his possession. [So it can only be misappropriation if he actually gives it to his fellow.]
Rather, from the latter clause [of that Mishnah].
"If he builds it into his house, behold, he has not trespassed until he has lived under it to the value of a perutah."
Let's see. He changes the stone! What does it matter if he lives [in the house] or if he doesn't live [in the house]?
That is like a mountain hanging by a thread!
And what is the difficulty? Perhaps it is like Rav, for Rav said,
For example, if one places [the stone] upon [the opening of] a roof-window, then, if he lives in it, indeed [he is guilty of misappropriation]. If he does not live in it, [he is] not [guilty of misappropriation].
Rather, really it is like Rava [who said it is the case of the sender remembers and the messenger does not remember], and your difficulty that it should be something akin to the case of one who takes sacred money for ordinary uses [where, even by mistake, still makes the mistaken party guilty of misappropriation], there he knew there was a zuz of Temple property, and he should have investigated [to find out if he was being sent to misappropriate it].
Here [in Rava's case], does he know? [Yet he is guilty!]
That is like a mountain hanging by a thread!
The verses are few and the laws many:
It was taught in a Baraita,
[Laws related to] leperousness and [laws of impurity related to] tents, the verses are few and the laws many.
[Laws related to] leperousness, the verses are few?
[Laws related to] leperousness, the verses are many!
R. Papa said, This is what it is saying,
[Laws related to] leperousness, the verses are many and the laws few. [Laws of impurity related to] tents, the verses are few and the laws many.
What is the practical import [of this statement]?
If you are in doubt about [laws related to] leperousness, look in Scripture. If you are in doubt on [laws of impurity related to] tents, look in the Mishnah.
Civil law:
But they are surely written!
It was only necessary for that of Rebbi.
For it was taught in a Baraita, Rebbi says,
(Exodus 21:23) "Life for a life" [meaning] money.
You'll say, money? Or truly "a life" literally?
"Giving" [which refers to recompense] is said below [in our verse], and "giving" is said above (Exodus 21:22). Just as there it is money, so too here is money.
Temple Services:
But they are surely written!
It was only necessary for bringing the blood [to the Mizbe'ach].
For it was taught in a Baraita,
(Leviticus 1:5) "and they shall bring..." That is the receiving of the blood.
And Scripture expressed it by a word which denotes "bringing," as it is written, (Leviticus 1:13) "And the kohen shall bring all of it and burn it on the altar."
But the Master said,
That is to the bringing of limbs to the ramp [of the Mizbe'ach], to say that the "bringing" did not take it out of "receiving."
[Ritually] clean. ...
But they are surely written!
It was only necessary [to teach this] for the size of a ritual purity bath, which isn't written.
For it was taught in a Baraita,
(Leviticus 15:6) "And he shall wash his flesh in water" - ["he shall wash" refers to] the waters of a ritual purity bath
"all his flesh," - [refers to] water into which his whole body can enter. And how much is that? Cubit upon cubit to the height of three cubits.
The sages have calculated the waters of a ritual purity bath as forty seahs.
Ritually impure:
But they are surely written!
It was only necessary that a creeping thing is [the size of] a lentil, which is not written.
For it was taught in a Baraita,
(Leviticus 11:32) "In them." One might think "all of them" [can effect impurity], Scripture teaches, "of them".
One might think "part of them" [by only touching a part can effect impurity], Scripture teaches "in them." What's the case?
[He is impure] only when he touches a part [that is big enough] it is like the entirety.
The sages have calculated that that [is the size of] a lentil, for a snail at first is about the size of a lentil.
R. Yose in the name of R. Yehudah says, As the tail of a lizard.
Unlawful unions:
But they are surely written!
It was only necessary

Daf 11b

for [the forbidden sexual union of] the daughter of his rape [that not only is he forbidden to her, but he incurs the death penalty], which is not written [explicitly].
For Rava said, R. Yitzchak bar Avdimi said to me, There is [a scriptural connection between a case of a legitimate daughter and a daughter of rape] "they"/"they" (Leviticus 18:17, Leviticus 18:10), and there is [a scriptural connection between the description of the former as fully liable and the latter as fully liable] "harlotry"/"harlotry" (Leviticus 20:14).
"And these are the body of the Torah":
These are, those [i.e. the other items listed in the Mishnah] are not?
Rather say,
These <i>and</i> those are the body of the Torah. We shall return to you, [chapter of] "All of obligated..."
Mishnah: One may not expound [the laws of] forbidden sexual unions before three people, nor the account of Creation before two, nor the [Divine] Chariot before one, unless he is wise and understanding from his own knowledge.
Anyone who peers into four things would be better off if he had not come into this world:
What is above, what is below, what is before, and what is after.
And anyone who has no mercy for the honor of his Maker would be better off if he had not come into the world.
Gemara: In the first clause you say, "nor the [Divine] Chariot before one," [which implies the only person who can learn this topic is one who already knows on his own] and after your say,
"unless he is wise and understanding from his own knowledge." [That's the same thing!]
This is what it's saying:
"One may not expound [the laws of] forbidden sexual unions <i>to</i> three people, nor the account of Creation <i>to</i> two, nor the [Divine] Chariot <i>to</i> one unless he is wise and understanding from his own knowledge. [If so, he may be taught]."
One may not expound [the laws of] forbidden sexual unions before three people:
What is the reason?
If you'll say, because it is written, (Leviticus 18:6) "each man [lit. man man] to any that is near of kin", "man man" is two, "that is near of kin" is one, and Scripture said, "You shall not approach to reveal the nakedness..." [teaching us that it cannot be approached pedagogically less than three]. Really now [that "man man" means you can't teach in front of at least two]? But it is written "each man [lit. man man] that curses his God," (Leviticus 20:9) "each man [lit. man man] that gives of his offspring unto Molech," so too [should not be discussed]!
Rather, these ["man man" verses] are needed to include gentiles, who are forbidden to curse God and idolatry, like the Jews, this [verse] too is needed to include gentiles, who are forbidden from illicit unions, like the Jews.
[So what is the reason one may not teach this before three?] Rather,
From that which is written, (Leviticus 18:30) "You shall observe My charge." "You (plural) shall observe" is two, "My charge" is one, and Scripture said, "That you don't do any of these abominable laws" [referring to illicit unions].
Really now [that "you shall observe" implies two"]? But it is written, (Exodus 31:14) "You shall observe the Sabbath," (Exodus 12:17) "You shall observe the Unleavened Bread," (Numbers 18:5) "You shall observe the charge of the Temple," so too [should not be discussed]!
Rather, R. Ashi said,
What is [meant by] "One may not expound [the laws of] forbidden sexual unions before three people"? One may not expound the secrets of [i.e the inferences of] forbidden sexual unions in front of three.
What is the reason? It is logical.
When two sit before their rabbi, one is having a give and take with his rabbi, and the other inclines his ear to the learning.
With three, one is having a give and take with his rabbi, and the other two are having a give and take with each other, and know not what their rabbi is saying, and they come to allow things that are prohibited in the matter of unlawful unions.
If so [that we are concerned for this possibility], the whole Torah should also [be taught in such a manner]!
Unlawful unions are different, for the Master had said,
Robbery and unlawful unions, his soul lusts and desires for them.
If so, robbery also [should be included in the rule of how many to teach]. 
Unlawful unions, whether [the situation] is in front of him or not, his temptation is strong [to commit the sin].
Robbery, his temptation is strong when it's in front of him. When it is not in front of him, his temptation is not strong.
"Nor the account of Creation before two":
What is the source for these words?
Our Rabbis have taught,
(Deuteronomy 4:32) "Ask (singular) now of the days that are past." One may ask, and two may not ask.
One might think that a person should ask about things that were before the creation of the world. Scripture teaches, (Deuteronomy 4:32) "Since the day that God created man upon the earth."
One might think that a person should not ask about the six days of creation. Scripture teaches, "Of the days that are past which were before you."
One might think that a person should ask about what is above and what is below, what is before and what is after. Scripture teaches, (Deuteronomy 4:32) "and from the one end of heaven unto the other." From the one end of heaven unto the other you may ask, but you may not ask about what is above, what is below, what is before, what is after.

Daf 12a

Now that this is deduced from the words, "from the one end of heaven unto the other," what do I need "since the day that God created man upon the earth" for?
Like that of R. Elazar.
For R. Elazar said,
Adam the First was from the earth to the firmament, as it is said, "from the day that God created man upon the earth," and once he became rotten [by sinning], the Holy One, blessed be He, placed His hand upon him, and made him small, as it is said, (Psalms 139:5) "You have fashioned me after and before, and laid Your hand upon me."
R. Yehudah said in the name of Rav,
Adam the First was from one end of the world to the other, as it is said, "since the day that God created man upon the earth, and from one end of heaven unto the other."
Once he became rotten [by sinning], the Holy One, blessed be He, placed His hand upon him and made him small, as it is said, "and laid You hand upon me."
If so, these verses contradict each other! [One part of the verse says he was from earth and the firmament, and the other part says from one end of the heaven to the other!]
These and those are of the same dimensions.
And R. Yehudah said in the name of Rav,
Ten things were created on the first day, and they are these:
Heaven and earth, chaos and desolation, light and darkness, wind and waters, the measure of the day and the measure of the night.
"Heaven and earth", as it is written, (Genesis 1:1) "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth." Chaos and desolation, as it is written, (Genesis 1:2) "And the earth was chaos and desolation." Light and darkness, darkness as it is written, (Genesis 1:2) "and darkness was upon the face of the deep," light as it is written, (Genesis 1:2) "And God said, Let there be light." Wind and water, as it is written, (Genesis 1:3) "and the wind of God floated upon the face of the waters."
The measure of the day and the measure of the night, as it is written, (Genesis 1:5) "And there was evening and there was morning, one day."
It was taught in a Baraita,
Chaos is a green line encompassing all the world, and from it darkness springs,
as it is said, (Psalms 18:12) "He made darkness His hiding place round about Him." Desolation, these are smooth stones sunk in the deep, from which waters come forth, as it is said, (Isaiah 34:11) "and He shall stretch upon it the line of chaos and the stones of desolation."
And was light created on the first day?
But it is written, (Genesis 1:17) "and God set them in the firmament of the heaven," and it is written, (Genesis 1:19) "and there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day." 
It is like R. Elazar.
For R. Elazar said,
The light which the Holy One, blessed be He, created on the first day, Adam saw through it from one end of the world to the other. When the Holy One, blessed be He, peered at the generation of the Flood and the generation of the Dispersion, and saw that their actions were destructive, He stood up and hid it from them, as it is said, (Job 38:15) "And from the wicked their light is withheld."
And for whom did He take it away? For the righteous of the time to come, as it is said, (Genesis 1:4) "And God saw the light, that it was good," and "good" only refers to the righteous, as it is said, (Isaiah 3:10) " Say of the righteous, that he is good."
Once He saw the light He hid away for the righteous, He rejoiced, as it is said, (Proverbs 13:9) "He rejoices at the light of the righteous."
Like [the following] Tannaic argument:
The light which the Holy One, blessed be He, created on the first day, Adam observed and peered through it from one end of the world to the other. These are the words of R. Yaakov.
And the sages say,
These are the lights which were created on the first day, but were not hung up until the fourth day.
R. Zutra bar Tuvya said in the name of Rav,
With ten things the world was created:
With wisdom and with understanding and with knowledge and with strength and with rebuke and with might and with righteousness and with judgment and with mercy and with compassion.
With wisdom and with understanding, as it is written, (Proverbs 3:19) "The Lord with wisdom founded the earth; with understanding He established the heavens."
With knowledge, as it is written, (Proverbs 3:20) "With His knowledge the depths were broken up." With strength and might, as it is written, (Psalms 65:7) "With His strength He establishes the mountains, being girded about with might." With rebuke, as it is written, (Job 26:11) "The pillars of heaven tremble, and are astonished at His rebuke." With righteousness and judgment, as it is written, (Psalms 89:15) "Righteousness and judgment are the foundation of Your throne." With mercy and compassion, as it is written, (Psalms 25:6) "Remember Your compassion, O Lord, and Your mercies, for they are eternal." And R. Yehudah said in the name of Rav,
At the time that the Holy One, blessed be He, created the world, it went expanding on like two weaves of woof and warp, until the Holy One, blessed be He, rebuked it and brought it to a standstill, as it is said, (Job 26:11) "The pillars of heaven tremble, and are astonished at his rebuke."
And this is what Resh Lakish said,
What is it that is written, (Genesis 35:11), "I am God Shaddai"? I am He Who said to the world, Enough ("dai").
Resh Lakish said, At the time that the Holy One, blessed be He, created the sea, it went expanding on, until the Holy One, blessed be He, rebuked it and made it dry, as it is said, (Nahum 1:4) "He rebukes the sea and makes it dry, and dries up all the rivers."
Our Rabbis have taught,
The house of Shammai say,
The heavens were created first, and afterwards the earth was created, as it is said, (Genesis 1:1) "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth."
But the house of Hillel say,
The earth was created first, and afterwards the heavens, as it is said, (Genesis 2:4) "In the day that the Lord God made earth and heaven."
The house of Hillel said to the house of Shammai,
According to you, [does] a person builds an upper story, and afterwards builds the house?
[The heavens are called an upper story,] as it is said, (Amos 9:6) "He builds his upper story in the heavens and sets its foundation on the earth."
The house of Shammai said to the house of Hillel,
According to you, [does] a person makes a footstool and afterwards makes a throne?
[The heavens are called a throne,] as it is said, (Isaiah 66:1) "So says the Lord, The heaven is My throne and the earth is My footstool."
But the sages say,
This and that were created at once, as it is said, (Isaiah 48:13) "My own hand laid the foundations of the earth, and my right hand spread out the heavens; when I summon them, they all stand up together."
And the other [opinions of Shammai and Hillel], what is "together"? That they cannot be separated the one from the other [once created].
The verses contradicts each other!
Resh Lakish said,
When they were created, He created the heavens, and afterwards created the earth, but when He stretched them out, He stretched out the earth, and afterwards stretched out the heavens.
What is heaven?
R. Yose bar Chanina said,
That there is water.
It was taught in a Mishnah,
fire and water.
Teaching that the Holy One, blessed be He, brought them and mingled them one with the other, and made from them the firmament.
R. Yishmael asked R. Akiva, while they were walking on the road. He said to him,
You are one who served Nachum Ish Gamzu for twenty-two years, who expounded the meaning of all the particles "et" in the Torah. What was his exposition of "the heaven and earth" - "et hashamayim v'et ha'aretz"?
He said to him,
If it had said "shamayim va'aretz," I would have said,
"Shamayim" is the name of the Holy One, blessed be He. Now that the words are "et hashamayim v'et ha'aretz,"
"shamayim" means the heaven, literally, and aretz means the earth, literally.

Daf 12b

[If the purpose of "et hashamayim" is to show that it is not God's name,] why do I need "et ha'aretz"? To show precedence of heaven to earth.
(Genesis 1:2) "And the earth was chaos and desolation." Let's see. He began with heaven first. What changed that it is [now] considering the account of the earth?
The house of R. Ishmael taught,
It is comparable to a king of flesh and blood, who says to his servants,
Rise up early [and come] to my door.
He himself rises early, and finds women and men. Whom does he praise? Those whose way is not to rise early, yet did rise early. [Thus, earth, mentioned second in order in verse 1, was created at the same time as the heaven, and is "praised" by being described first in verse 2.]
It was taught in a Baraita: R. Yose says,
Woe to the creatures which see and know not what they see, which stand and know not upon what they stand.
Upon what does the earth stand? Upon the pillars, as it is said, (Job 9:6) "Who shakes the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble."
The pillars stand upon the waters, as it is said, (Psalms 136:6) "To him that spread forth the earth upon the waters." The waters upon the mountains, as it is said, (Psalms 104:6) "The waters stood upon the mountains." The mountains upon the wind, as it is said, (Amos 4:13) "For lo he that forms the mountains and creats wind." The wind upon the storm, as it is said, (Psalms 148:8) "Stormy winds do His bidding." The storm is hung upon the arm of the Holy One, blessed be He, as it is said, (Deuteronomy 33:27) "Underneath are the everlasting arms."
And the sages say,
It stands upon twelve pillars, as it is said, (Deuteronomy 32:8) "He set the bounds of the nations according to the number of the children of Israel."
And some say,
Seven pillars, as it is said, (Proverbs 9:1) "She has hewn out her seven pillars."
R. Elazar ben Shamua says,
Upon one pillar, and its name is "The Righteous", as it is said, (Proverbs 10:25) "And the righteous is the foundation of the world."
R. Yehudah said,
There are two firmaments, as it is said,
(Deuteronomy 10:14) "Behold, unto the Lord your God belong the heaven and the heaven of heavens."
Resh Lakish said,
There are seven, and these are them: Vilon, Rakia, Sh'chakim, Z'vul, Ma'on, Machon, Aravot.
Vilon has no purpose at all except for the entering of morning the leaving of evening, and renewing every day the work of Creation, as it is said, (Isaiah 40:22) "That stretches out the heavens as a curtain, and spreads them out as a tent to dwell in."
Rakia, within it are set the sun and moon, stars and constellations, as it is said, (Genesis 1:17) "And God set them in the Rakia of the heaven."
Sh'chakim, within it stand the millstones and grind manna for the righteous, as it is said, (Psalms 78:23) "And he commanded the Sh'chakim above and opened the doors of heaven; and he rained down manna upon them to eat..."
Z'vul, within it is [the heavenly] Jerusalem and the Temple, and the built altar, and Michael the High Officer stands and offers upon it an offering, as it is said, (I Kings 8:13) "I have surely built a house of Z'vul, an institute for You to dwell in forever."
And where is it called heaven? As it is written, (Isaiah 63:15) "Look down from heaven and behold from Z'vul your holiness and your glory."
Ma'on, within it are the classes of the ministering angels, who utter His song at night and are silent in the day for the honor of Israel, as it is said, (Psalms 42:9) "By day the Lord commands His kindness, and by night His song is with me."
Resh Lakish said,
Anyone who delves into Torah by night, the Holy One, blessed be He, extends over him the thread of kindness by day, as it is said, (Psalms 42:9) "By day the Lord commands His kindness." And what is the reason that "By day the Lord commands His kindness"? Because "by night His song is with me."
And some say, Resh Lakish said,
Anyone who delves into Torah in this world, which is likened to the night, the Holy One, blessed be He, extends over him the thread of kindness for the world to come, which is likened to the day, as it is said, (Psalms 42:9) "By day the Lord gives his merciful command, and by night his song is with me."
R. Levi said,
Anyone who desists from words of Torah, and delves into words of [idle] talk, coals of broom-wood devour him, as it is said, (Job 30:4) "Who cut up mallows over idle talk, and the root of the broom devours them."
And where is it called heaven? As it is said, (Deuteronomy 26:15) "Look down from your holy Ma'on from heaven."
Machon, within it are the storehouses of snow and the storehouses of hail, and the high place of harmful dews, and the high place of raindrops, and the room of the whirlwind and of the storm, and the cave of vapor, and their doors are made of fire, as it is said, (Deuteronomy 28:12) "God shall open unto you His good storehouse."
These exist in the firmament! [So how can they be in Machon?]
These exist in the earth,
as it is written,
(Psalms 148:7) "Praise God from the earth, you sea-monsters and all depths, fire and hail, snow and vapor, stormy winds doing his bidding."
R. Yehudah said in the name of Rav,
David sought mercy for them, and He sent them down to the earth.
He said before Him,
Master of the world, (Psalms 5:5) "You are not a God that desires wickedness; evil shall not sojourn with You."
You are righteous, O Lord; evil shall not sojourn in your dwelling. And where is it called heaven? As it is written, (I Kings 8:39) "And hear in heaven, the Machon of Your dwelling."
Aravot, within it is righteousness and judgment and charity, the cache of life and the cache of peace and the cache of blessing, and the souls of the righteous, and the spirits and souls which will be created in the future, and the dew with which the Holy One, blessed be He, will resurrect the dead.
Righteousness and judgment, for it is written, (Psalms 89:15) "Righteousness and judgment are the foundation of Your throne." Grace, for it is written, (Isaiah 59:17) "And he dressed in charity as a coat of mail." The cache of life, for it is written, (Psalms 36:10) "For with You is the source of life." And the cache of peace, for it is written, (Judges 6:24) "And called it, God-peace." And the cache of blessing, for it is written, (Psalms 24:5) "He shall receive a blessing from the LORD." The souls of the righteous, for it is written, (I Smauel 25:29) "Yet the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD your God." The spirits and souls which will be created in the future, for it is written, (Isaiah 57:16) "For the spirit that enwraps itself is from Me, and the souls which I have made."
And the the dew with which the Holy One, blessed be He, will resurrect the dead, for it is written, (Psalms 68:10) "Rain in abundance, O God, you shed abroad; you restored your inheritance as it languished."
There are the divine wheels and seraphs and holy beings and ministering angels, and the throne of glory, and the King, the Living God, high and lifted up, dwelling over them in Aravot, as it is said, (Psalms 68:5) "Cast up a highway for him that rides upon the Aravot, his name is Yah." And where is it called heaven? [An exegetical connection] comes "riding"/"riding".
It is written, (Psalms 68:5) "Cast up a highway for him that rides upon Aravot," and it is written, (Deuteronomy 33:26)  "who rides upon the heaven for Your help."
And darkness and clouds and thick darkness surround Him, as it is said, (Psalms 18:12) "He made darkness his hiding place, his pavilion round about him, darkness of waters, thick clouds."
And is there darkness before the Heavenly?
But it is written,
(Daniel 2:22) "He reveals the deep and secret things; he knows what is in the darkness and the light dwells with him."
There is no difficulty.
The one

Daf 13a

This one refers to that which is within, and this one refers to that which is outside.
And Rabbi Acha the son of Ga'on said,
"There is another firmament above the heads of the <em>chayot</em>, as it is written, 'And a figure on top of the head of the <em>chaya</em>; a firmament, like the appearance of the great snow (Ezekiel 1:22).'
Until this point, you have the permission to speak [about]; from here further, you do not have permission to speak [about], for so it is written in the Book of Ben Sira,
'In what is too wondrous for you, do not request; and in what it covered from you, do not investigate.' What you have been permitted to, understand; and you have no business with the hidden things.
It was taught: Rabbi Yochanan the son of Zakai said,
"What is the answer that the heavenly voice answered to the same evildoer when he said, "I shall ascend on the heights of dense ground to the One Above (Isaiah 14:14)"? A heavenly voice went out and said to him,
'Evildoer the son of an evildoer the grandson of Nimrod the evildoer, who made the whole earth rebel against His rule.'"
How many are the [average] days of a man? Seventy years, as it is said, "The days of our life in it are seventy years, and if with strength, eighty years (Psalms 90:10)."
Behold! The distance from the earth to the firmament a five-hundred years' walk! And the thickness of every firmament is a five-hundred years' walk, and so too between every firmament!
Above them are the holy <em>chayot</em>.
The feet of the <em>chayot</em> are equal to them all.
The lower legs of the <em>chayot</em> are equal to them all. The upper legs of the <em>chayot</em> are equal to them all. The thighs of the <em>chayot</em> are equal to them all. The bodies of the <em>chayot</em> are equal to them all. The necks of the <em>chayot</em> are equal to them all. The heads of the <em>chayot</em> are equal to them all. The horns of the <em>chayot</em> are equal to them all.
Above them is the Throne of Glory.

Daf 13b



Daf 14a



Daf 14b

(1) The Rabbi's taught: There were four who entered the Pardes (sublime orchard) and they are - Ben Azzai, Ben Zoma, Acher (Alisha Ben Avuya) and Rabbi Akiva. Before they entered, Rabbi Akiva said to them: "When you reach near the pure marble stones, do not say "water water", because it says "a speaker of lies shall not abide before my eyes". (2) Ben Azzai glanced and died ... Ben Zoma glanced and became unstable ... Acher chopped down saplings. R' Akiva emerged in peace.
