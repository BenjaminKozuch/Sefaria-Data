Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a






It is taught elsewhere:
Seven days before the burning of the [red] calf, they would separate the priest who was to burn the calf from his house [and bring him] to the chamber overlooking the [Temple] building from the northwest, and it was called the 'Chamber of the House of Stone.'
And why was it called 'Chamber of the House of Stone'? Because all of its work (ie. the work done inside) was with Manure vessels, Stone vessels, and Earthenware vessels [all three of which cannot contract impurity].

Daf 86b
















Rabbi Yitzhak said: "They said in the West in the name of Rabbah, son of Mari:
'Come and see that God's character is not like that of (a person of) flesh and blood.  
This is the character of (a person of) flesh and blood: If one mocks his fellow with words, it is doubtful whether that person can be appeased by him or not.  And even if you say he can be appeased, it is doubtful whether he can be appeased merely with words or not.  
But God, if a man commits a transgression in secret, is appeased by him merely with words.  As it is said: "Take with you words, and return to the Lord." (Hosea 14:3) And not only that, God considers a good deed! As it is said: "Accept that which is good." (ibid.) And not only that, Scripture exalts him as if he had sacrificed bulls.  As it is said: "We will offer the bulls of our lips." (ibid.)
In case you say that bulls are obligatory, Scripture says: "I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely." (Hosea 14:5)

Daf 87a


























[Transgressions between a person and God, etc.]...
Rav Yosef, son of Havu, pointed out the following contradiction to Rabbi Abahu:
(Yom Kippur atones for transgressions between a person and God, but for) transgressions against one's neighbor, Yom Kippur cannot atone (until he appeases his neighbor).
Isn't it also written: "If one person sins against another, God will mediate for him."? (1 Samuel 2:25)
Who is God (in this scenario)? The judge.
If so, how do we understand the end of that verse?
"But if a person sins against God, who will mediate for him?"
What he means to say is:
If a person sins against another person, God will mediate for him and his fellow will forgive him. But if a person sins against God, who will mediate for him? Only repentance and good deeds.
Rabbi Yitzhak said:
"One who angers his fellow, even merely through words, must appease him.  As it is said: 'My son, if you take a pledge for your neighbor, if you clasp hands for a stranger, you are ensnared by the words of your mouth.  Do this now, my son, and be saved, since you are at another's mercy: Go! Humble yourself and beg your neighbor.' (Proverbs 6:1-3)"
If you have financial means, open the palm of your hand to him (i.e. pay him).  And if not, gather many others around him.
Rav Hisda said:
"It is necessary to appease him with three rows of three people (each).  As it is said: 'He comes before men and says, "I have sinned and perverted that which is right, and it has not profited me.' (Job 33:27)"
Rabbi Yossi, son of Hanina, said:
"One who begs a favor of his fellow should not ask it of him more than three times.  As it is said: 'Please, forgive please...and now please forgive.'  (Genesis 50:17)" And if he [against whom he had sinned] has died, he should bring ten people and stand them around his grave and say:
"I have sinned against the Lord, the God of Israel, and against so-and-so whom I have injured."
Rabbi Abba once had a grievance with Rabbi Yirmiyah.  He (Rabbi Yirmiyah) went and sat down at Rabbi Abba's door.  
When the maid pour out water, some drops touched his head.  
He said:
"They have made me like a dung-heap!" He recited this passage about himself: "He raises the need from the dung-heaps." (Psalms 113:7)
Rabbi Abba heard and went out to face him and said to him: 
"Now, I must come forth to appease you! As it is written: 'Go, humble yourself and beg your neighbor.'" (Proverbs 6:3)
When Rabbi Zeira had a grievance against a certain person, he would pass by them repeatedly and show  that he was willing to reconcile, so that they would come out and appease him.  
Rav once had a grievance with a certain butcher.  The butcher did not come before him (to reconcile).  
On the eve of Yom Kippur he (Rav) said:
"I will go to appease him."
Rav Huna met him
and asked him: "Where are you going, Master?"
He said: "To appease so-and-so."
He (Rav Huna) said (to himself):
"Abba is about to cause one's someone's death."  Rav came and stood over the butcher, who was sitting and chopping (an animal's) head.  He raised his eyes and said to him:
"You're Abba!?
I have no grievance with you." (Also possibly: "I will have nothing to do with you.")
While he was chopping the head, a bone flew off, struck him in the throat, and killed him.  
Once Rav was expounding upon a Biblical text before the Rabbis, and there entered

Daf 87b

Rabbi Hiyya.  Rav returned to the beginning (and began again).  Bar Kapara entered.  Rav returned to the beginning (and began again).  
Rabbi Shimon, the son of Rabbi, entered.  Rav returned to the beginning (and began again).
Rabbi Hanina, the son of Hama, entered.  Rav said:
"All this continually going back! Let's go!!"
He did not return (to the beginning).  
Rabbi Hanina was angry.  Rav went to him on thirteen eves of Yom Kippur, but could not appease him.
But how could Rav do so?
Didn't Rabbi Yosi, the son of Hanina, say:
"One who requests a favor from his fellow should not request it from him more than three times."?
Rav is different.
And how could Rabbi Hanina do so? (withholding forgiveness)
Didn't Rabba say:
"One who overlooks his own principles/character traits, all his transgressions are overlooked."?
Rather, Rabbi Hanina had seen in a dream that Rav was being hanged from a date tree.  And everyone knows that one who is hanged from a date tree (in a dream) will become head (of an Academy).  
He (Rabbi Hanina) said (to himself):
"Derive from it that authority will be given to him."
And so he would not be appeased, so that (Rav) would go to teach Torah in Babylon.
