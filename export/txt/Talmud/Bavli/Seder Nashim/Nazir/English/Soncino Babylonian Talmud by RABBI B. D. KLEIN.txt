Raba said: 
If he searched, [found a corpse]  and removed it, searched [again and found another] and removed it, [and then] searched [again] and found [a third corpse], he must not remove this one [for reburial] with the other two,  nor the other two [for reburial] with this one.
Others say that Raba said: 
As permission had been given to remove [the others],  he may remove them [all]  
But why should not [the field] become a graveyard site?  — 
Resh Lakish said: 
[The Rabbis] seized upon any pretext to declare the Land of Israel clean.
Suppose he searched [beyond it] for twenty cubits [in one direction only]  and did not find [another corpse], what is the law?  — ...
R. Monashya b. Jeremiah, citing Rab, replied:...
 This is the graveyard site. ...
 What is the reason [that we say this?]  — ...
Resh Lakish said: ...
They seized on any pretext to declare the Land of Israel clean.
MISHNAH. EVERY DOUBTFUL CASE OF [LEPROUS] DISEASE  ENCOUNTERED FOR THE FIRST TIME BEFORE UN CLEANNESS HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED IS CLEAN. ...
AFTER UNCLEANNESS HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED DOUBTFUL CASES ARE UNCLEAN.
GEMARA. How do we know this?  — ...
Rab Judah citing Rab, said: ...
The verse says, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.  Scripture mentions cleanness first.  
In that case even after uncleanness has been established, doubtful cases should be clean? — 
We must therefore say that this dictum of Rab, quoted by R. Judah was uttered in connection with the following. [A Mishnah says:] 
If the bright spot  appears before the white hair, he is unclean, but if the white hair appears before the bright spot he is clean. 
If there is a doubt, he is unclean. ...
R. Joshua said: ...
It is doubtful.  ...
What is meant by 'it is doubtful'? — ...
Rab Judah  replied: ...
It is doubtful and [consequently] clean.  ...
May it not mean that it is doubtful and [consequently] unclean? — ...
Rab Judah citing Rab said: ...
The verse says, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean;  Scripture mentions cleanness first.
MISHNAH. A PERSON SUFFERING FROM A FLUX IS EX AMINED REGARDING SEVEN THINGS,  BEFORE THE PRESENCE OF GONORRHOEA HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED,  VIZ.: — 
WITH REGARD TO FOOD,  DRINK, BURDENS, LEAPING,  SICKNESS, A VISION  OR AN IMPURE THOUGHT.  
ONCE GONORRHOEA IS ESTABLISHED, HE IS NO LONGER EXAMINED. [FLUX RESULTING] FROM AN ACCIDENT  TO HIM, DOUBTFUL [FLUX].  
AND HIS ISSUE OF SEMEN ARE UNCLEAN, FOR THERE IS A PRESUMPTION [OF UNCLEANNESS].
IF A MAN GIVES ANOTHER A BLOW FROM WHICH HE WAS EXPECTED TO DIE AND HE PARTIALLY RECOVERED AND THEN GREW WORSE AND DIED [THE OTHER] IS LIABLE [FOR MURDER]. R. NEHEMIAH...
 EXEMPTS HIM SINCE THERE IS A PRESUMPTION [IN HIS FAVOUR].
GEMARA. How do we know this?  — 
Rbi Nathan said: ...
The verse says. And of the gonorrhoeic  that have the issue,  [whether it be a man or a woman]. [The male] at his third experience of issue is compared to the female.  
But have we not been taught: R. Eliezer Says: ...
At the third [issue] we examine him but not at the fourth?  ...
In point of fact they disagree on [the question of stressing the particle] 'the'.  R. Eliezer lays stress on [the particle] 'the', whilst the Rabbis do not do so.
[FLUX RESULTING] FROM AN ACCIDENT TO HIM, DOUBTFUL FLUX:
