Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a

A virgin is married on the fourth day [of the week] and a widow on the fifth day, for
twice in the week the courts sit in the towns,
on the second day [of the week] and on the fifth day, so that if he [the husband] had a claim as to the virginity [of the bride] he could go early [on the morning of the fifth day of the week] to the court.
GEMARA. R. Joseph said: Rav Judah said [that] Shmuel said: 
Why did they [the rabbis] say: A virgin is married on the fourth day?
Because we have learned: If the time [determined for the marriage] arrived and they were not married, they eat of his [food] and they eat of terumah.”
You might have thought that if the time arrived on the first day of the week he would have to supply her with food, therefore have we learned, 
“A virgin is married on the fourth day.”
R. Joseph said:
Master of Abraham!
He [Shmuel] attaches a Mishnah which was taught, to a Mishnah which was not taught!
Which was taught and which was not taught?
This was taught and this was taught!
Rather 
he attaches a Mishnah, the reason of which was explained, to a Mishnah, the reason of which was not explained.
Rather if it was said, this is what was said: Rav Judah said [that] Shmuel said:
Why did they say, “A virgin is married on the fourth day of the week”? Because if he had a virginity claim he could go early the [next morning] to the court. 
Let her be married on the first day of the week, and if he has a virginity claim he could go early [on the morning of the second day of the week] to the court! The Sages watched over the interests of the daughters of Israel so that [the bridegroom] should prepare for the feast three days, 
on the first day in the week, the second day in the week, and the third day in the week, and on the fourth day he marries her.
And now that we have learned that the sages “watched over the interests” that which we have learned: If the time arrived and they were not married, they eat of his [food] and they eat of terumah, if the time arrived on the first day of the week, since he cannot marry her, he does not give her food.
Therefore, if he became ill or she became ill, or she began to menstruate, he does not give her food.
There are those who put this as a question:
If he became ill, what is [the law]? 
There the reason [he need not support her,] is because he is forced, and here too, he is also forced?
Or perhaps
there he was forced by an enactment which the Rabbis enacted, but here, he is not? 
And if you say:  If he became ill he provides her with food, [then the question would still be] if she became ill, what is [the law]? 
Can he say to her,
I am here? Or, perhaps, she can say to him, “His field has been flooded”?
And if you will say [that] she can say to him, “His field has been flooded” [then the question is,] if she began to menstruate, what is the law? 
During her regular time there is no question that she cannot say to him, 

Daf 2b

During her regular time there is no question that she cannot say to him, “His field has been flooded. 
When is the question asked? Not during her regular time, what is [the law]?
Since it is not during her regular time, she can say to him, “His field has been flooded”? Or, perhaps, since there are women who change their periods, it is as if it was her regular time?
R. Ahai answered: [The mishnah states]: 
“When the time came and they were not married, they eat of his food and they eat of terumah.”
It does not state: They [the men] did not marry them [the women], rather [it says] “They [the women] were not married.” What is the case? If they delayed [the marriage] why should they eat of his food and eat of the terumah? 
Therefore, you must say that they were forced as in this case, and it states
“they eat of his food and they eat of terumah”?
R. Ashi said:
Indeed I can say [that] 
in the case of any forced [delay] she does not eat [of his]. And [the mishnah refers to a case where] they [the men] delayed. And it should have stated, “They [the men] did not marry [the women].” But since the first clause refers to them [the women], the latter clause also speaks of them [the women].
Rava said: 
And with regard to divorce it is not so. 
thus Rava holds [that] 
“force” is not a claim in regard to divorce.
From where does Rava get this [rule]? 
If we say, from what we have learned: 
“Behold this is your get if I do not come back from now until twelve months,” and he died within twelve months, there is no divorce. 
[And we would conclude from this that only if] he died there is no divorce, but if he became ill there is a divorce. 
But perhaps I could say to you [that] 
if he became ill there would also be no divorce. And it teaches us that
 there is no divorce after death.
[That] there is no divorce after death, it taught us earlier: 
“Behold, this is your get if I die,” [or] “Behold, this is your get [if I die] from this illness,” [or] “Behold, this is your get after [my] death,” he has not said anything.
[But] perhaps [that mishnah] excludes from the opinion of our rabbis, 
for it has been taught:
Our rabbis allowed her to marry again. And we said:
Who are ‘our rabbis? 
Rav Judah said [that] Shmuel said:
The court that allowed the oil [of gentiles]. 
They hold like R. Yose who said,
“The date of the document attests to [when it is effective].
Rather [he derives it from the] later clause: 
This is your get]  from now if I do not come [back] from now [and] until twelve months,” and he died within the twelve months, it is a divorce.
[And we may deduce] “if he died,” and the same rule applies if he became ill. 
[But] perhaps [the divorce is effective] only when he died, because he did not want her to be liable to [marry] the levir (yavam).
But [rather deduce] from here: 
here was a certain [man] who said to them:  “If I do not come [back] from now until thirty days it shall be a divorce.” He came [back] at the end of thirty days but the ferry prevented him [from crossing]. He said to them,
“Look, I have come [back]; look, I have come [back]!”  
Shmuel said:
This is not regarded as having come back.
But perhaps a case of “force” which is frequent  is different, for since he ought to have stipulated it and he did not stipulate it, he caused himself a loss.
Rather [we must say] Rava stated his own opinion: On account of modest women and on account of loose women.  
On account of modest women, because if you will say that it should not be a divorce.  

Daf 3a

sometimes [it may happen] that he was not held back by an accident, and she would think that he was held back by an accident  and she would be an agunah, and sit waitng for him.
And on account of loose women, because if you will say [that] it should not be a divorce, sometimes [it may happen] that he was held back by force and she would say that he was not held back by force and she would go and get married, and the result would be [that] the divorce was invalid and her children [from the second marriage] would be mamzerim.
But is there anything that according to the law of the Torah it would not be a divorce   and on account of “chaste women” and on account of “loose women” we allow a married woman to the world?
Yes, everyone who betroths, does in accordance with the laws of the rabbis, and the rabbis have annulled his betrothal.
Ravina to R. Ashi:
This makes sense [if] he betrothed her with money, [but if] he betrothed [her] by act of marriage, what can one say [then]?
The rabbis have made his act of marriage [an act of] fornication.
There are those who say: Rava said: 
And so [also] with regard to divorce.
Therefore Rava holds
[that the plea of] force does apply to divorce.  They objected:
“Behold this is your get if I do not come [back] from now [and] until twelve months,” and he died within twelve months, there is no divorce.
If he dies there is no divorce, but if he became ill there would be a divorce
[That] there is no divorce after death a previous Mishnah teaches.
Indeed I might say that if he became sick there would be no divorce either, and [the Mishnah] teaches us this that there is no divorce after death.
Perhaps [that is] to exclude from that of our teachers.
Come and hear: 
“[This is your get] if from now if I have not come [back] from now [and] until twelve months,” and he died within the twelve months it is a divorce.
Would not the same rule apply if he became ill?
No, only if he died, because he did not want his wife to become subject to levirate marriage.
Come and hear:
A certain [man] said to them:
“If I do not come [back] from now [and] until thirty days it shall be a divorce.” He came [back] at the end of thirty days but the ferry prevented him [from crossing]. And he said to them,
“Look, I have come [back]; look, I have come [back]!”
And Shmuel said:
This is not regarded as having come back.
An accident which is frequent is different, for since he should have stipulated it and he did not stipulate it, he caused himself the loss.
Shmuel b. Yitzchak said:
They only taught this from the enactment of Ezra and after, [according to which] the courts sit only on the second day and on the fifth day [of the week].
But before the enactment of Ezra, when the courts sat every day, a woman could be married on any day.
Before the enactment of Ezra, what there was there was!
This is what 
he means: 
If there are courts that sit now as before the enactment of Ezra, a woman may be married on any day.
But what about the issue of “they watched diligently over…”?
This is in a case where he already prepared [for the feast].

Daf 3b

What does it mean “they watched diligently over”?
As it has been taught:
Why did they say that a virgin is married on the fourth day? So that if he has a virginity claim he could go early the [next morning] to the court.
But let her be married on the first day of the week and if he has a virginity claim he could go early [on the morning of the second day of the week] to the court?
The Sages watched diligently over the interests of the daughters of Israel so that [the man] should prepare for the feast three days,
the first day of the week, and the second day of the week, and the third day of the week, and on the fourth day he marries her.
And from [the time of] danger the people had a custom to marry on the third day and the sages did not stop them.
And on the second day [of the week] he shall not marry; and if on account of duress it is allowed.
And on the second day [of the week] he shall not marry; and if on account of duress it is allowed.
What [was the] danger?
If I say that they said, 
If I say that they said,  then why does it just say that “they made it a custom”? 
Let them abolish it entirely!
Rabbah said:
[That] they said: A virgin that gets married on the fourth day [of the week] shall first have sexual intercourse with the governor.
Is this danger?
This is duress!
Because there are chaste women who would rather surrender themselves to death and [thus] come to danger.
But teach them that [in a case of] duress [it] is allowed?
There are loose women and there are also priestesses.
But [then] let them abolish it?
A decree is likely to be annulled, and [therefore] we do not abolish an enactment of the rabbis on account of a decree.
If so, on the third day he [the governor] would also come and have intercourse [with the bride]?
Out of doubt he does not move himself.
“And on the second day [of the week] he should not marry; but if on account of duress it is permitted.”
What is “duress”?
If you say [that it is] that which we have said, there it is called “danger” and here it is called “duress”?
And further, there [it states], “they made a custom” but here, “it is allowed”!
Rava said:
They say: “A general has come to town.” 
What is the case?
If he comes and passes by, let it be delayed.
It is not necessary [to state this but] that he came and stayed.
Let him, [then], marry on the third day [of the week]!
His vanguard arrived on the third day.
And if you want I can say:
And if you want I can say:
If his bread was baked and his meat slaughtered and his wine mixed and the father of the bridegroom or the mother of the bride died, they bring the dead [person] into a room and the bridegroom and the bride into the huppah

Daf 4a

 and he has the mandated act of intercourse and then separates from her. And [then] he observes the seven days of the [wedding] feast and after that he keeps the seven days of mourning. 
And [during] all these days he sleeps among the men and she sleeps among the women. 
And they do not withhold jewellery from the bride all the thirty days. 
[But this is] only [if] the father of the bridegroom or the mother of the bride [died], because there is [then] no one who should prepare for them [for the wedding], but not [in case of] the reverse.
Rafram b. Papa said [that] R. Hisda said: 
They taught [this] only when water had [already] been put on the meat, 
but if water had not [yet] been put on the meat, it is to be sold.
Rava said:
And in a city, although water had been put on the meat, it is sold.
Papa said:
And in a village, although water had not been put on the meat, it is not sold.
But where [then] will you find [the rule] of R. Hisda?
Ashi said:
For instance, [in] Mata Mehasia, which is neither a city nor a village.
It has been taught according to R. Hisda: 
If his bread was baked and his meat prepared and his wine mixed and water had been put on the meat and the father of the bridegroom or the mother of the bride died, they bring the dead [person] into a room and the bridegroom and the bride into the bridal chamber, and he has the mandated act of intercourse and [then] separates [himself from her]. And [then] he keeps the seven days of the [wedding-] feast and after that he keeps the seven days of mourning.
And all these days he sleeps among the men and she sleeps among the women.
And so [also] if his wife became a menstruant he sleeps among the men and she sleeps among the women.
And they do not withhold jewelry from the bride all the thirty days.
In any case he should not have relations with her on Friday night or Saturday night.
The master said [above]:
He sleeps among the men and she sleeps among the women.
This supports R. Yohanan,
for R. Yohanan said:
Although they said [that] there is no mourning on a festival, he keeps [mourning] in private.
Joseph the son of Rava expounded in the name of Rava: 
They taught this only if he had not yet had intercourse with her but if he had [already] intercourse, his wife may sleep with him.
But here we are dealing with a case where he had intercourse, and it still it teaches [that]
 he sleeps among the men and she sleeps among the women?
When did he say [this]? With regard to his wife becoming a menstruant.
But it teaches:

Daf 4b

And so [also if his wife became a menstruant].
This is what he means to say: And so [also], if his wife became a menstruant and he had not yet had intercourse [with her] he sleeps among the men and she sleeps among the women.
Is this [then] to say mourning is lighter in his eyes than menstruation? 
Did not R. Yitzchak the son of Hanina say that R. Huna said: 
All kinds of work which a wife performs for her husband, a menstruant may perform for her husband, except mixing the cup, making the bed and washing his face, his hands and his feet;
But with regard to mourning it has been taught: 
Although they said: 
A man may not force his wife to paint [her eyes] or rouge [her face], in truth they said:
 She may mix him a cup and make his bed and wash his face, his hands and his feet?
[This is] not difficult: Here [it speaks] of his mourning, there   [it speaks] of her mourning.  
But it says: “The father of the bridegroom or the mother of the bride [died]”? 
This refers to the rest.
But is there a difference between his mourning and her mourning?
Has it not been taught:
If a man’s father-in-law or mother-in-law died, he cannot force his wife to paint [her eyes] and to rouge [her face]. Rather he turns over his bed and keeps mourning with her.
And so [also] if a woman’s father-in-law or mother-in-law died she is not allowed to paint [her eyes] and to rouge [her face], but she turns over her bed and keeps mourning with him!
Teach with reference to his mourning:
He sleeps among the men and his wife sleeps among the women.
But it says: And so too?  
This refers to paint and rouge.
But it says with him! Does this not mean with him in one bed?
No, [it means] with him in one house, 
and as Rav said to his son Hiyya:
In her presence keep mourning, in her absence do not keep mourning. 
Ashi said:
Can you really compare this mourning with ordinary mourning?
Ordinary mourning is strict and he would not deal lightly with it.
[But] this mourning, since the rabbis were lenient [about it], he might come to deal lightly with it.
What is the leniency? 
 Shall I say because it teaches that he has the mandated act of sex and then separates [from her]?
 That is because he has not yet become obligated in mourning, if according to R. Eliezer, [the mourning does not begin] until the body has been taken out of the house, and if according to R. Joshua, [the mourning does not begin] until the rolling stone has been closed!
Rather [the leniency is this,] because it teaches: 
He keeps [first] the seven days of the [wedding] feast and after that he keeps the seven days of mourning.
The master said: 
 In any case he many not have first intercourse on the eve of Shabbat or in the night following Shabbat. 
It makes on the eve of Shabbat, because of a wound. But in the night following the Shabbat, why not?
Zera:

Daf 5a



Daf 5b

he should plug his finger into his ears
And this is the same thing that R. Elazar said:
Why do the fingers of man resemble pegs?
What is the reason?
 Shall I say because they are divided? [Surely] each one has been made for its own purpose! For the Master said: 
This one is zeret, this one is kemitzah, this one is amah, this one is etzba and this one is gudal.
Rather, [the question is] why [are the fingers] curved like pegs? 
That if one hears an unworthy thing he shall plug his fingers into his ears.
A tanna of the school of R. Ishmael taught:
Why is the whole ear hard and the ear-lap soft
[So] that if a person hears an unworthy thing he shall bend the ear-lap into it. 
Our Rabbis taught:
A man shall not let his ears hear idle things, because they are burned first of [all] the organs. 
The question was asked: 
Is it allowed to have sex for the first time on Shabbat? Is the blood [in the womb] stored up, or is it the result of a wound?
And if you will say [that] the blood is stored up [in the womb, then the question is:] does he need the blood, and it is allowed: or does he need the opening, and it is forbidden?
And if you will say [that] he needs the blood and the opening comes of itself, [then the question is:] Does the halakhah follow R. Shimon who says: A thing which is not intended is
allowed; or does the halakhah follow R. Judah who says: 
A thing which is not intended is forbidden?
And if you will say [that] the halakhah is according to R. Judah [then the question is], do damage in regard to the opening, or does he improve in regard to the opening? 
There are those who state the question this way:
And if you will say that the blood is the result of a wound [then the question is], does he need the blood and it is forbidden, or is he concerned with his own pleasure, and it is allowed?
And if you will say [that] he is concerned with his own pleasure and the blood comes out of itself, [then the question is] does the halakhah follow R. Judah or does the halakhah follow R. Shimon?
And if you will say [that] the halakhah follows R. Judah, [then the question is,] does he do damage by [making] the wound, or does he improve by [making] the wound?
And if you will say [that] he does damage by [making] the wound, [then the question is,] with regard to one who does damage, does the halakhah follow R. Judah? 

Daf 6a

Or does the halakhah follow R. Shimon?
It was stated: in the school of Rav they said:
Rav permitted and Shmuel forbade. 
In Nehardea they said:
Rav forbade and Shmuel permitted.
Nahman b. Yitzchak said: And your sign is:
These are lenient on themselves, and these are lenient on themselves.
But does Rav permit it?
Did not R. Shimi b. Hezekiah say in the name of Rav: 
[As regards] that stopper of the brewing vat, it is forbidden to squeeze it in on a festival day!
In that [case]  even R. Shimon admits [that it is forbidden], 
for Abaye and Rava, both of them say:
R. Shimon admits [that it is forbidden] in [a case of] “If he cuts off its head, will it not die.”
[But] R. Hiyya the son of Ashi said [that] Rav said:
The halakhah is according to R. Judah,   and R. Hanan the son of Ammi said that Shmuel said:
The halakhah is according to R. Shimon.
And R. Hiyya the son of Avin taught it without [naming the] men: 
Rav said the halakhah is according to R. Judah and Shmuel said
the halakhah is according to R. Shimon?
In any case Rav holds like R. Judah, according to the version that says, 
“the blood is stored up [in the womb],” he does damage to the opening,
[and] according to the version that says, “the blood is the result of a wound,” he does damage in [making] the wound.
Hisda objected:
If a young girl, whose age of menstruation has not arrived, married: Bet Shammai says:
she is allowed four nights; And Bet Hillel says: 
until the wound is healed.
If the age of her menstruation has arrived and she married: Bet Shammai says:
 she is allowed the first night;
And Bet Hillel says: 
four nights, until after Shabbat.

Daf 6b

[Now] does it not  mean that if he had not yet had intercourse [with his wife] he may have intercourse [with her] even on Shabbat?
Rava said:
No, except for Shabbat.
Abaye said to him:
But it says: “until the night following Shabbat, four nights!”
Rather Rava said:
Rather Rava said:
 If already had intercourse, what does it teach us?
It teaches us that it is permitted to have intercourse on Shabbat, as with the [statement] of Shmuel,
for Shmuel said:
One may enter into a narrow opening on Shabbat, although  he causes pebbles to break loose.
Joseph objected: 
A bridegroom is exempt from the reading the Shema in the first night until after Shabbat, if he has not performed the act.
Is it not because he is anxious to have intercourse?
Abaye said to him:
No; he is anxious because he has not had intercourse.
Rava said to him:
And on account of anxiety [only] he is exempt [from the Shema]?
If this were so, then if his ship sank in the sea, he would also be exempt!
And should you say that this is so, did not R. Abba b. Zabda say [that] Rav said: 
A mourner is obligated to observe all the mitzvot stated in the Torah except tefillin because it is said with regard to them an “ornament” (Ezekiel 24:17).
Rather Rava said: 
This is a dispute of tannaim,
for one teaches:
If he did not do the act on the first night, he is exempt [from the Shema] also in the second night;  in the second night, he is exempt [from the Shema] also in the third night.
And another teaches:
In the first and second night he is exempt, but in the third night he is obligated to read Shema.
And Abaye? 
He could hold that there they also differ with regard to anxiety.
And these tannaim [are] like those tannaim,
as it has been taught:
He who marries a virgin should not have first intercourse on Shabbat, but the Sages allow [it].
He who marries a virgin should not have first intercourse on Shabbat, but the Sages allow [it].
Rabbah said:
It is R. Shimon, who says:
A thing which is not intended is allowed.
Abaye to him:
But R. Shimon agrees [that it is forbidden] in a case of “If its head was cut off will it not die”!
He said to him:
Not like those Babylonians who are not skilled in moving to the side, rather there are some who are skilled in moving to the side.
If so, why would he be anxious?
This refers to one who is not skilled.
[Then] let them say: One who is skilled is allowed, one who is not skilled is forbidden?
Most [people] are skilled.
Rava the son of R. Hanan said to Abaye:
If this were so, then why have groomsmen,
why have a sheet?
He [Abaye] said to him
There perhaps he will see and destroy [the tokens of her virginity].
Ammi objected: 
He who pierces an abscess on Shabbat, if in order to make an opening for it, he is liable, but if [in order] to cause pus to come out of 

Daf 7a

There it is stored up and ready to be released, here it is stored up but not ready to be released.
There it is stored up and ready to be released, here it is stored up but not ready to be released.
Ammi permitted first intercourse on Shabbat.
The Rabbis said to him:
But her kethubah is not written yet!
He said to them:
Let her seize movable goods.
Zevid permitted to have first intercourse on Shabbat. 
Others say:
R. Zevid himself had first intercourse on Shabbat.
Rav Judah permitted first intercourse on a festival.
Papi said in the name of Rava:
Do not say that on a festival it is allowed, but on Shabbat it is forbidden, for it is also allowed on Shabbat, and the event that happened, happened in that way.
Papa said in the name of Rava:
On a festival it is allowed, on Shabbat it is forbidden.
Papi said to R. Papa: 
What is your opinion? Since a wound has been permitted for a necessity it should also be permitted when there is no necessity?
If that were so, it should be permitted to put incense on coals on a festival, for since the kindling of fire has been allowed on a festival for a necessity, it should be allowed also when there is no necessity!
He said to him: 
Concerning this the verse said, “Except for that which is eaten by every person,” something that is equally used by every person.
Aha, the son of Rava, said to R. Ashi:
If this were so, then if a deer happened to come to a person on a festival, since it is not of equal usefulness for every person, it would be forbidden to kill it?  
He said to him:
I say: a thing that is needed every person, [and] a deer is needed every person.
Jacob bar Idi said:
R. Yohanan instructed in Sidon:
It is forbidden to have first intercourse on Shabbat.
And is there instruction for a prohibition?
Yes
as we have learned in a Mishnah:
Bet Hillel instructed her that she should be a Nazirite for another seven years.
Alternatively like that which has been taught: 
If the cord of the spinal column is severed in its larger portion [the animal is trefa], the words of Rabbi.
R. Jacob says:
Even if it is only perforated [the animal is trefa].
Rabbi instructed according to R. Jacob.
Huna said:
The halakhah is not according to R. Jacob.
Nahman b. Isaac taught it thus:
R. Abahu said:  R. Ishmael b. Jacob from Tyre asked R. Yohanan in Sidon, and I heard: 
Is it allowed to have first intercourse on Shabbat?
And he said to him:
It is forbidden.
And the law is:
It is allowed to have first intercourse on Shabbat.
Helbo said in the name of R. Huna in the name of R. Abba bar Zavda, in the name of Rav: 
Both a virgin and a widow requires a blessing.
But did R. Huna say this? 
Did not R. Huna say:
A widow does not require a blessing?
It is not difficult:
Here it refers to a young man who marries a widow, there to a widower who marries a widow.
And when a widower marries a widow a blessing is not required?
Did not R. Nahman say: Huna b. Natan said to me: A tanna taught: 
From where do we know that the blessing of the bridegrooms requires the presence of ten? 
Because it is said, “And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said: ‘Sit down.’ And they sat down” (Ruth 4:2). And Boaz was a widower who married a widow! 
What is it that R. Huna meant, “she does not require a blessing”? She does not require a blessing during all the seven days but on one day she requires a blessing.
But that which has been taught:
The Sages were concerned for the welfare of the daughters of Israel that he may rejoice with her for three days: when does this occur?  
If [it speaks] of a young man, did you not say seven days;  If of a widower, did you not say one day?
If you want, you may say that  
it refers to a widower: One day is for the blessing and three days are for rejoicing. And if you wish, 
you may say that it refers to a young man: Seven days are for the blessing and three days for rejoicing.


Daf 7b

They objected:
They bless over a virgin for seven days and over a widow one day.
Is this not even [in the case of] a widow who marries a young man?
No [only when the widow marries] a widower.
But [if a widow is married to] a young man, what is the rule?
Seven days? If that is so, let it be taught: They say the blessing for a virgin for seven days, and for a widow who marries a young man seven [days], and for a widow [who marries a widower] one day?
It taught a decided thing: That there is no virgin who has less than seven days and there is no widow who has less than one day.
The above text says: R. Nahman say:
Huna b. Natan said to me: A tanna taught:
From where do we know that the blessing of the bridegrooms requires the presence of ten? Because it is said, “And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said: ‘Sit down.’ And they sat down” (Ruth 4:2).
But R. Abahu said from here:
“In assemblies you shall bless God, the Lord, from the fountain of Israel” (Psalms 68:27). And R. Nahman, what does he expound with verse used by R. Abahu?
He requires it for the following teaching:
R. Meir used to say:
From where do we know that even fetuses in the wombs of their mothers sang a song by the sea?
Because it is said, “In assemblies you shall bless God, the Lord, from the fountain of Israel” (Psalms 68:27).”
And the other one? If [that were] so, let the verse say, “From the womb.” Why “from the fountain”? Concerning the matters of the fountain.
And R. Abbahu how does he expound that verse of R. Nahman? He requires it for expounding:
An Ammonite, and not an Ammonitess, a Moabite, and not a Moabitess. 
For if you would think that he needed ten to recite the blessing, would it not have been sufficient for them not to be elders?
And the other one?
If you would think [that the verse was to be used] for that midrash, would it not have been sufficient if there had not been ten [persons]?
Yes, to publicize the matter,
and as Shmuel said to R. Hanna of Baghdad:
Go out and bring me ten and I will say to you in their presence;
If one assigns [property] to an embryo, it acquires it....
But the law is:
If one assigns [property] to an embryo, it does not acquire it.      
Our rabbis taught: 
The bridegrooms’ blessing is recited in the house of the bridegroom.  
Judah says:
Also in the house of the betrothal they bless it.
Abaye said:
And in Judah they taught [R. Judah’s opinion] because [in Judah] he is secluded with her.
Another [baraita] teaches:
The bridegrooms’ blessing is said in the house of the bridegrooms and the blessing over betrothal
in the house of betrothal. [As to] the blessing over betrothal, what does one bless?
Rabin b. R. Adda and Rabbah son of R. Adda both said in the name of Rav Judah:
 Blessed are You, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who has sanctified us by His commandments and has commanded us concerning the forbidden relations and has forbidden to us the betrothed   and has allowed to us the married through huppah and kiddushin.
Aha the son of Rava, concludes it in the name of Rav Judah: 
Blessed are You, O Lord, who sanctifies Israel through huppah and kiddushin.
He who does not conclude [holds that] it is like the blessing over deriving benefit and the blessing [said on performing] mitzvot. And he who concludes [holds that] it is like kiddush.
Our Rabbis taught:
They bless the bridegrooms’ blessing in the presence of ten persons all the seven days.
Rav Judah said:
And that is only if new guests come.
What does he bless?
Rav Yehudah said: Blessed are You, LORD, our God, sovereign of the universe,

Daf 8a

who created everything for His Glory. [Blessed are You, LORD, our God, sovereign of the universe,] who creates man. [Blessed are You, LORD, our God, sovereign of the universe,] who creates man in your image, fashioning perpetuated life. Blessed are You, LORD, creator of man. May the barren one exult and be glad as her children are joyfully gathered to her (in haste). Blessed are You, LORD, who gladden Zion with her Children. Grant perfect joy to these loving companions, as you did your creations in the Garden of Eden. Blessed are You, LORD, who grants the joy of groom and bride. Blessed are You, LORD, our God, sovereign of the universe, who created joy and gladness, groom and bride, mirth, song, delight and rejoicing, love and harmony and peace and companionship. Soon, LORD our God, may there ever be heard in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem voices of joy and gladness, voices of groom and bride, the jubilant voices of those joined in marriage under the bridal canopy, the voices of young people feasting and singing. Blessed are You, LORD, who causes the groom to rejoice with his bride. 
Levi came to the house of Rabbi at the wedding-feast of R. Shimon his son [and] said five blessings.  
Assi came to the house of R. Ashi at the wedding-feast of Mar his son [and] said six blessings.
Shall we say that they argue about this: One holds that there was one formation, and the other holds that 
there were two formations?
No. All agree that there was only one formation, [but they disagree over this:] 
One holds that we go according to the intention, and the other holds [that] 
we go according to the act,
as in the statement of Rav Judah who contrasted the following verses:
It is written, “And God created man in His own image,” (Genesis 1:27) and it is written, “Male and female He created He them” (Genesis 5:2). How is this [to be understood]?
In the beginning it was God’s intention to create two human beings, and in the end only one was created. 
Rav Ashi came to the house of Rav Kahana. The first day he said all the blessings. From then and on; if there were new guests he said all the blessings, but if not it is just a continuation of the same joy he blesses, “In whose dwelling there is joy” and “Who has formed.”
From the seventh day to the thirtieth day whether he said to them “Because of the wedding”   or whether he did not say to them “Because of the wedding,” one says the blessing “In whose dwelling there is joy.”
From then and on: If he said to them “Because of the wedding” he says the blessing “In whose dwelling there is joy,” but otherwise not.
And if he says to them “Because of the wedding,” until when [do they say the blessing]? 
Rav Papi in the name of Rava: 
Twelve months, a year.
And at the outset from when [do they recite the special blessing]? 
Rav Papa said:
From the time that they put barley into the mortar.
But is this so? 
Did not Rav Papa busy himself for his son Abba Mar and say the blessing from the time of the betrothal?
It was different [in the case of] Rav Papa, for all the preparations were made for him.
Ravina busied himself [preparing for the wedding] for his son in the house of Rav Habiba and said the blessing from the time of the betrothal. 
He said:
 I am sure with regard to them that they will not retract [the betrothal]. The matter was not successful and they did retract.
Rav Tahlifa of the West, came to Babylon [and] said six long blessings.  
But the law is not according to him.
Rav Habiba came into the house of a circumcision [and] said the blessing “In whose dwelling there is joy.” But the law does not follow him, since they are distressed because the child has pain.
Rav Nahman said in the name of Rav: 
Bridegrooms count in the minyan, and mourners do not count in the minyan.  
They objected:
Bridegrooms and mourners count in the minyan!
You cast a baraita against Rav? Rav is a Tanna and disagrees.
It was stated: R. Yitzhak said that R. Yohanan said:
Bridegrooms count in the minyan, but mourners to do not count in the minyan.
They objected:
Bridegrooms and mourners count in the minyan!

Daf 8b

That was taught with regard to birkat hamazon and R. Yohanan referred to the line [in which mourners are comforted].
But what about the statement of R. Yitzhak in the name of R. Yohanan: 
They say the blessing of the bridegrooms in the presence of ten and the bridegrooms count in the minyan, and they say the blessing of the mourners in the presence of ten and the mourners do not count in the minyan.
Is there a blessing said in the line of comforters? 
Rather, R. Yohanan made that statement with regard to the [blessing recited in the] plaza.
But what about the statement of R. Yitzhak in the name of R. Yohanan:
They say the blessing of the bridegrooms in the presence of ten all the seven [days] and the bridegrooms count in the minyan and they say the blessing of the mourners in the presence of ten all seven and the mourners do not count in the minyan. Is the blessing [recited in] the plaza? 
It is possible in the presence of new guests.
As in the case of R. Hiyya bar Abba, [who was] the teacher of written Torah to the son of Resh Lakish, or, as some say, the teacher of oral Torah to the son of Resh Lakish. 
 A child of his died.
The first day [of mourning] he [Resh Lakish] did not go to him. The next day he [Resh Lakish] took with him Judah the son of Nahmani, his meturgaman. He said to him:
Rise, say something about the child.
He began to speak:
“And the Lord saw and spurned, because of the provoking of His sons and His daughters” (Deuteronomy 32:19). A generation in which the fathers spurn the Holy One, blessed be He, He becomes angry with their sons and their daughters and they die when they are young.
And some say 
he was a young man and that this is what he said to him:
“Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men, neither shall He have compassion on their fatherless and widows; for everyone is profane and an evil doer, and every mouth speaks folly. For all this His anger is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still” (Isaiah 9:16). What is the meaning of “but His hand is stretched out still”?
Rav Hanan bar Rav said:
All know why a bride goes into the bridal chamber, but whoever disgraces his mouth and lets a disgraceful word out of his mouth even if a decree of seventy years of happiness were sealed for him it is turned for him into evil.
He came to comfort, he caused him pain?
This is what he said to him:
You are important enough to be punished for the sins of the generation.
He said to him:
Rise, say something with regard to the praise of the Holy One, blessed be He.
He spoke and said:
The God, who is great in the abundance of His greatness, mighty and strong in an abundance of awesome deeds, who revives the dead with His word, who does great things that are beyond knowing and wondrous works without number. Blessed are you, O Lord, who revives the dead.
He said to him:
Rise, say something with regard to the mourners.
He spoke and said: 
Our brethren, who are worn out, who are crushed by this bereavement, set your heart to consider this:
This is what stands forever, it is a path from the six days of creation. Many have drunk, many will drink, as the drinking of the first ones, so will be that of the last ones. 
Our brethren, may the Lord of consolation comfort you. Blessed be He who comforts the mourners.
Abaye said:
Let him say, “Many have drunk” but “many will drink”  he should not say;
Let him say, “the drinking of the first ones,” but “the drinking of the last ones” he should not say, 
for R Shimon, the son of Lakish said, and so it was taught in the name of R. Yose: 
A person should never open his mouth to Satan.
Rav Joseph said:
What is the verse, “We would have been like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah” (Isaiah 1:9)? What did He reply unto him? “Hear the word of the Lord, you rulers of Sodom” (Isaiah 1:10).
He said to him:
Rise, say something with regard to the comforters of the mourners.
He spoke and said:
Our brethren, performers of acts of loving kindness, children of performers of acts of loving kindness, who hold fast to the covenant of Abraham our father [as it is said, “For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children…” (Genesis 18:19)],
our brethren, may the Lord of reward pay you your reward.  Blessed are you who pays a reward.
He said to him:
Rise, say something with regard to the whole of Israel. 
He spoke and said:
Master of the world, redeem and save, deliver and help Your people Israel from pestilence,   and from the sword, and from plundering, and from the blast, and from the mildew, and from all kinds of calamities that come into the world. 
Before we call, You answer. Blessed are you who stops the plague.
Ulla said, and some say it was taught in a baraita:
The sages established ten cups of wine for the house of the mourner: 
Three before the meal in order to open up the stomach, three during the meal in order to soak the food in the stomach, and four after the meal: one corresponding to “who sustains,” one corresponding to the blessing over the land, one corresponding to “who rebuilds Jerusalem,” and one corresponding to “who is good and does good.”
They added to them four more cups:
ne in honor of the officers of the town, and one in honor of the leaders of the town, and one in honor of the Temple, and one in honor of Rabban Gamaliel.
They began to drink and to become intoxicated,
they restored the matter to its original state. 
What does it mean “Rabban Gamaliel?”
As it has been taught:
At first the carrying out of the dead was harder for his relatives than his death, so much so that they would leave him and run away,
until Rabban Gamaliel came and treated himself lightly, and they carried him out in garments of linen,
and then all the people followed his example and carried out the dead in garments of linen. Rav Papa said: 
And now the common practice to carry out the dead even in rough cloth worth only a zuz.
Rabbi Elazar said:

Daf 9a

He who says: I have found an “open opening” is trusted to make her forbidden for him. Why?
 It is a double doubt:
It is a doubt [whether she had the intercourse with the other man while] married to him, or before married to him. And if you say that [she had that intercourse] while married to him, there is still a doubt [whether she had intercourse] by violence or according to her own free will!
It was necessary [to state this rule] in the case of the wife of a priest. 
And if you want, you may say [that it speaks of] the wife of an Israelite, and for instance when her father received the betrothal for her when she was less than three years and one day old. 
What does teach us?
We have already learned:
One who says to a woman, "I have betrothed you [to myself]” and she says, "You did not betroth me," she is permitted to his relatives, but he is forbidden to her relatives.
What you might have said? 
There he is certain, but here he is not certain. Therefore he teaches us [this rule].
But did R. Elazar really say this? 
Did not R. Elazar say:
A woman does not become forbidden to her husband
except with warning and seclusion, as we find in the occurrence that happened?
But is this reasonable?  Was the occurrence that happened accompanied by warning and seclusion?
And furthermore,
did they prohibit her to him?
This is not a difficulty,
for thus he means to say:
A wife does not become forbidden to her husband except in the case of warning and seclusion, [and this we learn] from the occurrence that happened, where there was no warning and seclusion and therefore she was not prohibited.
But in any case, there is still a difficulty. 
Where there was warning and seclusion [she is prohibited to him] but if [he said, “I found] an open opening” she is not prohibited! 
But according to your argument you could deduce:  [In the case of] warning and seclusion, yes, [and in the case of] witnesses, no!
Rather this is what he means:
The wife does not become forbidden for her husband through one witness but through two witnesses; but in the case of warning and seclusion, even through one witness, and “an open opening” is like two witnesses.
And if you will say: 
[In the case of] the occurrence that happened why did they not declare her forbidden? There it was rape.
And if you wish you can say like that of R. Shmuel the son of Nahmani said in the name of R. Yonatan: 

Daf 9b

Everyone who goes out into the battle of the House of David writes for his wife a bill of divorce, for it is written, “And to your brethren bring greetings, and take their pledge” (I Samuel 17:18). 
What does it mean “and take their pledge”? Rav Joseph taught:
Things which are mixed between him and her.
Abaye said: 
We have also taught this: A virgin is married on the fourth day of the week.
On the fourth day, but not the fifth day. What is the reason? On account of the cooling of his temper.
With regard to what [do we care if he cools off]?
If with regard to giving her the ketubah, let him give it to her. Rather it is with regard to making her forbidden to him.
And when he claims a claim is it not that he claims the claim of “an open opening”?
No, [it is a case where] he claims the claim of blood.
Rav Judah said [that] Shmuel said:
If any one says: “I have found an open opening,” he is believed to cause her to lose her ketubah.
Rav Joseph: 
What does he teach us?
We have already learned this:
He who eats at his father-in-law’s [between the time of betrothal and the time of marriage] in Judaea, without witnesses, cannot [after the marriage] make a virginity, because he was secluded with her.  
In Judaea he cannot make a claim, but in Galilee he can make it.
Now in which respect? 
If to make her forbidden for him, why should he not be able to make this claim in Judaea?
 Rather it is to cause her to lose her ketubah.
And when he claims a claim, is it not that he claims the claim of “an open opening”?
No, when he claims the claim of blood.

Daf 10a

It was stated: Rav Nahman said in the name of Shmuel who said in the name of R. Shimon ben Elazar:
The rabbis enacted for the daughters of Israel, for a virgin two hundred zuz and for a widow a maneh [one hundred zuz]. 
And they believed him, so that if he said, “I have found an open opening,” he is believed.
If so, what have the Sages accomplished with their enactment?
Rava said:
The presumption is [that] no one will take the trouble of preparing a wedding feast and will then spoil it.
It was taught:
Since it is a fine instituted by the sages she collects only from the worst land  [of the husband’s estate].
A fine!
Why is it a fine? 
Rather say:
Since it is an enactment of the sages, she collects only from the worst land [of the husband’s estate].
Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says:
A woman’s ketubah is from the Torah.
But did Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel really say this?
But it has been taught:
[It is written in the Torah] “He shall pay money according to the bride-price of virgins” (Exodus 22:16); that this is as much as the dowry of the virgins and the dowry of the virgins is as much as this.
 From here the Sages found a support for [the rule that] a woman’s ketubah is from the Torah. 
Rabban Shimon b. Gamaliel says:
A woman’s ketubah is not from the words of the Torah, but from the words of the scribes.
Reverse it.
And what did you see to reverse the latter? 
Reverse the former!
We have heard that R. Shimon ben Gamaliel said that the ketubah is from the Torah, for we learned: 
Rabban Shimon b. Gamaliel says: 
He gives her [the ketubah] in Cappadocian coins.
And if you wish, you may say:
The whole of it follows Rabban Shimon b. Gamaliel and it is defective and it teaches thus:
From here the sages found a support from the Torah for a woman’s ketubah.
The ketubah of a widow is not from the Torah but from the words of the scribes, for Rabban Shimon b. Gamaliel says:
The ketubah of a widow is not from the words of the Torah but from the words of the scribes.
A certain man came before R. Nahman and said to him:
I have found an open opening.  
Nahman answered:
Lash him with palm branches; prostitutes were available to him.
But it is R. Nahman who said that he [the husband] is believed!
He is believed, but they also lash him with palm-branches.
Ahai answered:
Here [it refers] to a young man, there [it refers] to one was married before.
A certain came before Rabban Gamaliel [and] said to him,
I have found an “open opening”.
He [Rabban Gamaliel] answered him:
Perhaps you moved aside.
I will give you a parable: To what is this like? To a man who was walking in the deep darkness of the night [and came to his house and found the door locked]. If he moves aside [the bolt of the door] he finds it open, if he does not move aside [the bolt of the door] he finds it locked.
There are those who say [that] he [R. Gamaliel] answered him thus:
Perhaps you moved aside intentionally and you tore away the door and the bar.
 I will give you a parable: To what is this like? To a man who was walking in the deep darkness of the night [and came to his house and found the door locked];
if he moves aside [the bolt of the door] intentionally he finds it open,
if he does not move aside [the bolt of the door] intentionally he finds it locked.
A certain man came before Rabban Gamaliel the son of Rabbi [and] said to him:
My master, I have had intercourse and I have not found any blood.
She said to him: 
My master, I was a virgin.
He said to them:
Bring me that cloth. 
They brought him the cloth, and he soaked it in water and he washed it and he found on it a some drops of blood. 
He [Rabban Gamaliel] said to him [the husband]:
Go, be happy with your acquisition.
Huna Mar the son of Rava of Parazikia said to R. Ashi:
We should also do this?  
He answered him: 

Daf 10b

Our  laundry work is like their  washing.
And if you will say let us do laundry work, [my answer is] the smoothing stone will remove it. 
A certain man came before Rabban Gamaliel the son of Rabbi [and] said to him:
My master, l have had intercourse and I have not found any blood.
She [the wife] said to him:
My master, I am still a virgin.
He said to them:
Bring me two handmaids, one who is a virgin and one who was not a virgin.
They brought them to him, and he placed them upon a cask of wine.
The one who was not a virgin, the smell wafted through; the virgin, the smell did not waft through.
He [then] placed this one [the wife] also [on a cask of wine] and the smell did not waft through. He said to him:
Go, be happy with your acquisition.
But he should have examined her from the very beginning!
He had heard a tradition, but he had not seen it done in practice. And he thought, lest the matter might not be certain and it would not be proper to deal lightly with daughters of Israel.
A certain man came before Rabban Gamaliel the elder [and] said to him: My master,
I have had intercourse and I have not found any blood.
She [the wife] said to him:
My master, I am of the family of Dorkati, [the women of] which have neither blood of menstruation nor blood of virginity.
Rabban Gamaliel investigated among her women relatives and he found in accordance with her words.
He [then] said to him: 
Go, be happy with your acquisition. Happy are you that you merited a woman of the family of Dorkati.
What is [the meaning of] Dorkati? A cut-off generation. 
Hanina said:
Empty consolation Rabban Gamaliel offered that man,
for R. Hiyya taught:
As the leaven is good for the dough, so is blood good for a woman.
And one has [also] taught in the name of R. Meir: 
Every woman who has abundant blood has many children.
It was said: R. Jeremiah b. Abba said:
He [Rabban Gamaliel] said to him [the husband]: Be happy with your acquisition.
But R. Jose b. Avin said: He said to him: You have been made liable with your acquisition.  It is understandable for the one who says, You have been made liable with your acquisition,  this follows the view of R. Hanina. But according to the one who says, “Be happy”, what is the merit [of such a marriage]?
He [the husband] does not come to any doubt regarding menstruation.
Someone came to Rabbi [and] said:
My master, I have had intercourse and I have not found any blood.
She said:
My master, I was [and am] still a virgin, and it was during years of famine. 
Rabbi saw that their faces were black, [and] he gave some orders concerning them, and they brought them to a bath and gave them to eat and to drink and brought them to the bridal chamber, and he (the husband) had intercourse with her and found blood.
He  said to him:
Go, be happy with your acquisition.
Rabbi applied to them the verse:
“Their skin is shriveled upon their bodies, it is withered, it is become like a stick” (Lamentations 4:8).
1) A virgin — her kethubah is two hundred [zuz], and a widow — a maneh (100 zuz).
2) A virgin, who is a widow, [or] divorced, or a halutzah from betrothal — her kethubah  is two hundred [zuz], and there is upon her a claim of non-virginity.
GEMARA. Why [is a widow called] “almanah”? 
R. Hana of Baghdad said:
Because of the maneh (al shum maneh).
But what can be said with regard to a widow from the betrothal?
Because that one is called “almanah” this one is also called “almanah.” 
What can be said with regard to [the word] “almanah,” that is written in the Bible? 
That the Rabbis will in future enact for her a maneh.
But does the Bible speak of a thing which will be in the future?
Yes, for it is written:  “And the name of the third river is Hiddekel, that is it which goes towards the east of Ashur” (Genesis 2:14), and R. Joseph taught:
Ashur, that is Seleucia.
But was [Seleucia] already then in existence?
But because it will exist in the future. Here too because it will exist in the future. 
And R. Hana of Baghdad also said:
“Rain” (matar)—waters, saturates and enriches [the earth] and refreshes and enlarges [the fruits].
Rava the son of R. Ishmael, and some say R. Yemar the son of Shelemyah, said: 
What is the verse?   “Saturating its furrows, leveling its ridges. You soften it with showers, You bless its growth” (Psalms 65:11). 
Elazar said:
The altar removes and feeds, makes beloved, atones.
“Atones” is the same as “removes” the same meaning?  
It removes [evil decrees] and atones for sins.
Hana of Baghdad also said:
Dates warm, satisfy, act as a laxative, satisfy and do not make [one] delicate.
Rav said:
If one has eaten dates, he should not give a legal decision.
They objected:
Dates in the morning and evening are wholesome, in the afternoon they are bad, at noon there is nothing like them
and they remove three things:
evil thought, gastrointestinal disorders, and bowel disorders!
Did we say that they are no good? 
They are indeed good, only for the moment [they cause] unsteadiness.
Just like wine, for the Master said: He who has drunk one-fourth [of a log] of wine shall not give a legal decision. 
And if you wish you may say:
There is no difficulty: 
This is before a meal and that is after a meal,
for Abaye said: Mother told me:
Dates before a meal are as an axe to the palmtree, after a meal as a bar to the door.
Dasha [door]: Rava explained:
Derekh sham  [that is the way].  
Darga [stairs, ladder]: Raba explained:
Derekh gag [by way of the roof].  
Puria [bed]: R. Papa explained:
Sheparin verabin aleha [because one is fruitful and multiplies on it].
Nahman b. Isaac said: 


Daf 11a

We also teach
“aylonit”—a “duchranit” for she cannot give birth.
A female proselyte, a woman captive, and a woman slave, who have been redeemed, converted, or freed [when they were] less than three years and one day old — their kethubah is two hundred [zuz] there is upon them a claim of non-virginity.
GEMARA. R. Huna said:
A minor convert is immersed on the consent of the court.
What you might have said? That it is an advantage to him and one may act for a person in his absence to his advantage? We have learned this already: 
One may act for a person in his absence to his advantage, but one may not act for a person in his absence to his disadvantage!
What you might have said?
A non-Jew prefers a life without restraint because it is established for us that a slave certainly prefers a life without restraint, therefore, he teaches us
that this is said only in the case of an adult who has already tasted sin,
but [in the case of] a minor, it is an advantage to him.
Should we say that [this Mishnah] supports him: 
A female proselyte, a woman captive, and a woman slave, who have been redeemed, converted, or freed [when they were] less than three years and one day old?
Is it not that they immersed them on the consent of the court?
No. What are we dealing with here? A proselyte whose sons and daughters were converted with him, that it is comfortable for them to do what their father does.
Joseph said: 
When they become of age they can protest [against their conversion].
Abaye raised a difficulty: 
 A female proselyte, a woman captive, and a woman slave, who have been redeemed, converted, or freed [when they were] less than three years and one day old — their kethubah is two hundred [zuz] there is upon them a claim of non-virginity.
Now if you indeed think that when they have become of age they can protest [against their conversion], would we give her the ketubah that she may go and consume [it] in her Gentile state?
When she has become of age.  
When she has become of age, she can protest and go out [of her marriage]! 
As soon as she was of age one hour and did not protest she cannot protest any more.
Rava objected:
 These young girls receive the fine:
If a man has intercourse with mamzeret, a netinah, a Samaritan, a convert, a captive or a slave, who have been redeemed, converted, or freed [when they were] less than three years and one day old–they have to be paid the fine. 
Now if you say [that] when they have become of age they can protest, would we give her the fine that she may go and consume it in her Gentile state?
When she has become of age.
When she has become of age she can protest and go out!
As soon as she was of age one hour and did not protest she cannot protest any more.
Abaye did not say as Rava [said] because there, with regard to the fine, the reason might be that the sinner should not have any benefit.  
Rava did not say as Abaye said because in the case of the ketubah the reason might be that it   should not easy for him to send her away.
When an adult has had sexual intercourse with a young girl, or when a small boy has had intercourse with an adult woman, or a girl who was injured by a piece of wood   — [in all these cases] their kethubah is two hundred [zuz], the words of Rabbi Meir.
But the Sages say:
a girl who was injured by a piece of wood — her kethubah is a maneh.
1. A virgin, who was a widow, a divorcee, or a halutzah from marriage— her kethubah is a maneh,

Daf 11b

and there is no claim of non-virginity upon her.
A female proselyte, a woman captive and a woman slave, who have been redeemed, converted, or freed [when they were] more than three years and one day old — their kethubah is a maneh, and there is no claim of non-virginity upon her.
GEMARA. Rav Judah said that Rav said: 
A young boy who has intercourse with an adult woman makes her [as though she were] injured by a piece of wood. 
When I said this before Shmuel he said: 
There is no such thing as “injured by a piece of wood” when done by flesh.
Some teach this teaching on its own:
[As to] a young boy who has intercourse with an adult woman: Rav said:...
He makes her [as though she were] injured by a piece of wood; whereas Shmuel said: 
There is no such thing as “injured by a piece of wood” when done by flesh.
Oshaia objected: 
When an adult has had sexual intercourse with a young girl, or when a small boy has had intercourse with an adult woman, or a girl who was injured by a piece of wood — [in all these cases] their kethubah is two hundred [zuz], the words of Rabbi Meir.
But the Sages say: 
a girl who was injured by a piece of wood — her kethubah is a maneh
Rava said.
It means this: When adult man has intercourse with a young girl it is nothing, for when the girl is less than this, it is like putting a finger into the eye....
But when a young boy has intercourse with an adult woman he makes her as “a girl who is injured by a piece of wood.” And “a girl injured by a piece of wood” is a dispute between R. Meir and the Sages.
Rami b. Hama said:
The dispute is only when he knew that she was [a mukat etz],
for R. Meir compares her to a mature girl, and the Sages compare her to a woman who had intercourse with a man.  
But if he did not know that she was a [mukat etz] , all agree that she receives nothing.
And why does R. Meir compare her to a mature girl? 
Let him compare her to a woman who had intercourse with a man!
[In the case of] a woman who had intercourse with a man, something had been done to her by a man; but in the case of a mukat etz, nothing had been done to her by a man.
And why do the Rabbis compare her to a woman who had intercourse with a man? Let them compare her to a mature girl!
[In the case of] a mature girl nothing whatsoever has been done to her, but in the case of a mukat etz something has been done to her. “But if he did not recognize that she was a mukat etz, all agree that she receives nothing.”
Nahman objected: 
If she says: “I was injured by a piece of wood,” and he says. ‘No, you had intercourse with a man,”...
Rabban Gamaliel and R. Eliezer say [that]
she is believed.
Rather Rava said: 
Whether he knew that she was a mukat etz or did not know according to R. Meir [her ketubah is] two hundred [zuz]. 
According to the Rabbis, if he knew that she was a mukat etz, [her ketubah is] a maneh, [if] he did not know, she gets nothing. 
Rava changed his opinion, for it has been taught: 
How does the bringing out of an evil name take place? 
 He comes to court and says,
“I, So-and-so, have not found your daughter to be a virgin.”
If there are witnesses that she fornicated while betrothed to him, she gets a ketubah of a maneh. 
If there are witnesses that she fornicated while betrothed to him,...
she is to be stoned! 
It means this: 
 If there are witnesses that she fornicated while betrothed to him, she is to be stoned; if she fornicated before the betrothal, she gets a ketubah of a maneh.
And R. Hiyya b. Abin said that R. Sheshet said: 
This means: If he married her in the presumption that she is a virgin and she was found to have had intercourse with a man, she gets a ketubah of a maneh.
And R. Nahman objected:
One who marries a woman and does not find her to be a virgin, and she says, “After you betrothed me I was raped and your field has been flooded,” and he says, “No, before I betrothed you, you had intercourse with a man and my acquisition was a mistake”–and she gets nothing!
And R. Hiyya b. Abin said to them: 
Is it possible! R. Amram and all the great ones of the generation sat when R. Shesheth said that teaching and they found it difficult and he   answered: 
What does it mean that it is a mistaken acquisition? In respect of two hundred [zuz], but she does receive a maneh. 
And you say that she receives nothing!
And Rava said:
He who asked [this question] has asked well, for a “mistaken acquisition” means entirely.
But [then] that [other teaching] presents a difficulty.  
Resolve it and say it this:
If there are witnesses that she fornicated while betrothed to him she is to be stoned, if she fornicated before [the betrothal], she gets nothing. If she was found to be injured by a piece of wood, she has a ketubah of a maneh.
But it was Rava who said [above that], according to the Rabbis, if he did not know that she was a mukat etz, she gets nothing!
Rather you must conclude from this that
Rava retracted that opinion.
Our Rabbis taught: 
If the first husband brought her [the bride] into his home for the sake of marriage and she has witnesses that she was not secluded with him,
or even if she was secluded with him, she did not stay with him as much time as is needed for intercourse, the second husband cannot make a virginity claim for the first [husband] had taken her into his home for the purpose of marriage. 

Daf 12a

Rabbah said:
This means that
if he married her in the presumption that she was a virgin and she was found to have had intercourse she gets a ketubah of a maneh. 
Ashi said:
In general I could say to you that she receives nothing; but it is different here, because the first one had married her.
But let us be concerned that she fornicated while betrothed to him!
Sheravia said:
For instance he betrothed her and immediately had intercourse with her.
There are those who teach this in reference to our Mishnah:
 A virgin, who was a widow, a divorcee, or a halutzah from marriage— her kethubah is a maneh, and there is no claim of non-virginity upon her.
A virgin from marriage- how is it possible?
When she was brought into the bridal chamber and no intercourse took place.
Rabbah said: This means that if he married her in the presumption that she was a virgin and she was found to have had intercourse she gets a ketubah of a maneh.
Ashi said:
In general I could say to you that she receives nothing; but it is different here, because the first one had married her.
But let us be concerned that she fornicated while betrothed to him!
Sheravia said:
For instance he betrothed her and immediately had intercourse with her.
He who teachs this in reference to the baraita, how much more [could he teach it in reference] to our Mishnah.  But he who teaches this in reference to our Mishnah might not teach it in reference to the baraita, because he could say to her,
“I have relied on the witnesses.”
He who eats with his father-in-law in Judea without the presence of witnesses cannot raise a virginity claim against his wife because he has been alone with her.
GEMARA. Since it says in the Mishnah “one who eats”, it follows that there are places also in Judea where one does not eat.  
Abaye said:
Conclude from this that in Judea, too, there are different places [with different customs].
As it was taught: R. Judah said:
In earlier times in Judea they used to leave the bridegroom and the bride alone one hour before their entry into the bridal chamber, so that he may become intimate with her,
but in Galilee they did not do so.
In earlier times in Judea they used to set up two groomsmen, one for him and one for her, in order to examine the bridegroom and the bride when they enter the bridal chamber, and in Galilee they did not do so.
In earlier times in Judea the groomsmen used to sleep in the house in which the bridegroom and the bride slept, and in Galilee they did not do so.
And anyone who did not act according to this custom could not make a virginity claim.
To which [does this refer]?
If I say [that it refers] to the first clause?  [If so,] It should have read, “He who acted [according to this custom]!”
And [if you will say that it refers] to the last clause, it should have read, “He who was not examined.”
Abaye said:
Indeed [it refers] to the first clause, and recite it [thus]:
“He who acted [according to this custom].
Rava said to him:
But it reads, “He who did not act [in this way]!”
Rather Rava said this is what it says: 
He who did not act according to the custom of Galilee in Galilee but [acted] according to the custom of Judea in Galilee cannot make a virginity claim.
R. Ashi said:
Indeed [it refers] to the last clause, and read it this way,
“He who was not examined.”
It is the same whether [the woman is] an Israelite widow or a priestly widow  — her kethubah is a maneh.
The court of the priests collected for a virgin four hundred zuz, and the sages did not protest.
GEMARA. A Tanna taught:
And the widow of a priest -her ketubah is two hundred.
But we have taught in our Mishnah:
 It is the same whether [the woman is] an Israelite widow or a priestly widow  — her kethubah is a maneh.
Ashi said: 
There were two enactments.
 At first they enacted for a virgin four hundred zuz and for a widow a maneh.

Daf 12b

When they saw that the treated them  lightly, they enacted for them two hundred zuz.
When they saw again that they stayed away from them, saying,
“Instead of marrying a priestly widow, we will rather marry the virgin Israelite,” they restored their [former] enactment.
The court of the priests, etc.: Judah said that Shmuel said: 
They did not say this only regarding the court of the priests, but even families of good lineage in Israel, if they want to do as the priests do, they may do so.
They objected:
If one wants to do as the priests do, for instance [if] the daughter of an Israelite [gets] married to a priest or the daughter of a priest [gets married] to an Israelite, one may do [so].
A daughter of an Israelite to a priest or a daughter of a priest to an Israelite [can do this] because one side belongs to the priesthood, but if the daughter of an Israelite [gets married] to an Israelite, it is not allowed!
It is a case of “not only”;
not only [is it allowed in the case of] the daughter of an Israelite [getting married] to an Israelite, who cannot say to her, “I am raising you up [to a higher social status”]; but [in the case of] the daughter of an Israelite [getting married] to a priest who can say to her, “I am raising you up [to a higher social status]” I might say that it is not allowed, therefore he teaches us that it is permitted.
If a man marries a woman and does not find her to be a virgin: She says,
 “After you betrothed me I was raped, and so your field has been washed away”
And he says,
“No, rather [it occurred] before I betrothed you and my acquisition was a mistaken acquisition” —
Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Eliezer say:
she is believed. Rabbi Joshua says:
We do not live by her mouth, rather she is in the presumption of having had intercourse before she was betrothed and having deceived him, until she brings proof for her statement.
GEMARA. It was stated: [One who says to another], “I have a maneh in your hand,” and the latter responds, “I do not know”:
Rav Judah and Rav Huna say: 
He is liable [to pay]. And R. Nahman and R. Yohanan say: 
He is exempt [from paying].  
Huna and R. Judah say:
He is liable [to pay]–in the case of “certain” and “perhaps” “certain is preferable.
Nahman and R. Yohanan say:
He is exempt [from paying]–leave the money in the possession of its present owner.
Abaye said to R. Joseph:
The opinion of R. Huna and Rav Judah corresponds with that of Shmuel,
for we have learned:
She was pregnant and they said to her,
“What is the nature of this fetus?’
[And she answered, “It is] from so-and-so and he is a priest.”
Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Eliezer say:
she is believed. 
And R. Judah said in the name of Shmuel:
The halakhah follows Rabban Gamaliel.
And R. Shmuel b. Judah said to Rav Judah:
Toothy one! You said to us in the name of Shmuel [that] the halakhah follows Rabban Gamaliel even in the first Mishnah.
[Now what does it mean]: “Even in the first [Mishnah]”? 
Even though one could say, “Leave the money in the possession of its [present] owner” [still] Rabban Gamaliel would say: “certain” is preferable.
Shall we then say that R. Judah and R. Huna follow the opinion of Rabban Gamaliel, and R. Nahman and R. Yohanan follow the opinion of R. Joshua?
Nahman could say to you:
I follow even the opinion of Rabban Gamaliel; 
only Rabban Gamaliel says it there because there is “migo”. But what “migo” is there here?
Alternatively: Rabban Gamaliel says it only there, because we say: “Leave her in her presumptive state,” but here what presumptive state has he got?
It is also reasonable, as we have answered, that R. Nahman follows the opinion of Rabban Gamaliel,

Daf 13a

 for if it were [not] so, there would be a difficulty between one halakhah and another halakhah, for we hold [that] in civil matters the halakhah follows R. Nahman, whereas in this [case] R. Judah [said] in the name of Shmuel [that] the halakhah follows Rabban Gamaliel.
Rather, it is as we resolved, conclude [so] from this.
She says,
“I was struck by a piece of wood”,  And he says,
“No, you, rather you have been trampled by a man:”
Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Eliezer say:
she is believed, And Rabbi Joshua says:
We do not live by her mouth, rather she is in the presumption of having been trampled by a man, until she brings proof for her statement.
GEMARA. What are their claims?
Yohanan says:
Two hundred zuz and a maneh. Elazar says:
A maneh and nothing.
Yohanan says:
Two hundred zuz and a maneh, he holds like R. Meir who says 
that whether he knew or did not know [she was a mukat etz] she gets as her kethubah two hundred zuz.
And R. Elazar says:
A maneh or nothing, because he holds like the Rabbis who say that
whether he knew of her or did not [she was a mukat etz], she gets a maneh.
It is understandable why R. Elazar does not say as R. Yohanan says because he interprets it  according to the Rabbis.But why does R. Yohanan not say as R. Elazar?
He holds that if he married her in the presumption of her being a virgin and she is found to have had intercourse, she has a ketubah of a maneh.
If so, here he would say “a maneh,” and she would say “a maneh,” and what difference would there be between his claim and her claim?
It is understandable, why, according to R. Elazar we have taught two cases [in the Mishnah]
one to exclude the opinion of Rami b. Hama, and one to exclude the opinion of R. Hiyya b. Abin in the name of R. Sheshet.
But according to R. Yohanan why are two cases necessary?
One to show you the strength of Rabban Gamaliel, and one to show you the strength of R. Joshua.
The first case to show you the strength of R. Joshua, that, although one could say there migo, she is not believed. The second case to show you the strength of Rabban Gamaliel, that, although one cannot say there migo, she is believed.
They saw her talking with someone in the marketplace, and they said to her,
“What sort of a man is he?”
And she answered, “He is so-and-so and he is a priest” —
Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Eliezer say: she is believed, 
And Rabbi Joshua says: we do not live by her mouth, rather she is in the presumption of having had relations with a natin or a mamzer, until she brings proof for her statement.
She was pregnant and they said to her,
“What is the nature of this fetus?’  
And she answered, “It is from so-and-so and he is a priest.” —
Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Eliezer say:
she is believed, And Rabbi Joshua says:
we do not live by her mouth, rather she is in the presumption of having had relations with a natin or a mamzer, until she brings proof for her statement.
GEMARA. What is the meaning of “talking”?
Ze’iri said:
She was secluded. R. Assi said:
She had intercourse.
It is understandable according to Ze’iri, for that is why it says, “talking.” But according to R.Assi why does it say “talking”?
It is a euphemism, as it is written: “She eats, and wipes her mouth, and says, ‘I have done no wickedness’” (Proverbs 30:20).
It is understandable according to Ze’iri that it teaches in the Mishnah two cases: “talking” and “pregnant,”
but according to R. Assi, why does the Mishnah teach two cases?
One case to declare her fit and one case to declare her daughter fit.
This goes well according to him who says that
he who declares her fit declares also her daughter fit. But according to him who says that
he who declares her fit declares her daughter unfit, what is there to say?
Assi holds like the one who says that he who declares her fit declares also her daughter fit.
1. Papa said to Abaye: 
According to Ze’iri who said: What is “talking”? She was secluded, and R. Joshua said that she is not believed, did not Rav say: 
We punish with lashes for seclusion but we do not prohibit on account of seclusion? Should we say that this does not follow R. Joshua?
You may even say that it follows R. Joshua, for they set a higher standard in matters of priestly lineage.
They objected:
If they saw her go in with someone into a hidden place

Daf 13b

or into a ruin, and they said to her,
“What sort of a man is he?”
and she answered, “He is a priest and he is the son of the brother of my father”:
Rabban Gamaliel and R. Eliezer say:
She is believed.
R. Joshua says:
We do not live by her mouth, rather she is in the presumption of having had intercourse with a natin or a mamzer, until she brings proof for her words.
It goes well according to Ze’iri, that it teaches two cases: into a hidden place or into a ruin.
But according to R. Assi who said: “she had intercourse,” why does it teach two cases?
It teaches only one case: Into the hidden place of a ruin.
But it teaches: Into a hidden place or into a ruin! 
Rather say one refers to the ruin of a town and one refers to the ruin of a field.
And they are both necessary. For if it had taught us only concerning a ruin of a town, I might have said that in this case Rabban Gamaliel declares her fit because most of the men of the town are fit with regard to her,
but in the case of  a ruin of a field, where most of the men are unfit with regard to her, I might say that he agrees with R. Joshua.
And if it  had told us only this case, I might have said that only in this case did R. Joshua say that she is not believed, but in that case I might say that he agrees with Rabban Gamaliel; therefore it was necessary to state both cases.
They objected:
This is testimony which a woman is fit to give. But R. Joshua says: 
She is not believed.
Joshua said to them:
Do you not agree that in the case of a woman who was captured, and there are witnesses that she was captured, and she says, “I am pure,” that she is not believed?
They said to him:
Yes, but
what a difference there is between this case and that case.
 In that case there are witnesses, and in this case there are no witnesses.
He said to them:
In this case too there are witnesses, for her stomach reaches up to her teeth.
They said to him:
Most non-Jews are unrestrained in sexual matters.
He said to them:
There is no guardian in sexual matters.
This applies only in the case of the testimony of the woman with regard to herself but in the case of the testimony of the woman with regard to her daughter all agree that the child is a shetuki.
What did he say to them and what did they answer him?
This they said to him:
You have answered us with regard to the pregnant woman, what will you answer us with regard to the woman whom they saw talking to a man? 
He said to them:
The woman whom they saw talking to a man is the same as the captive woman.
They said to him:
The captive woman is different, for most of the idolators are unrestrained in sexual matters.
He said to them: 
Here also, since she hid herself, there is no guardian in sexual matters.
Now in any case it teaches two cases: he woman whom they saw talking to a man and the pregnant woman! This is a refutation of R. Assi,
 this is indeed a refutation.
But let him note this difference–there most of the men are unfit with regard to her, but here most of the men are fit with regard to her!
This supports R. Joshua b. Levi, for R. Joshua b. Levi said:
He who declares her fit declares her fit even when most of the men are unfit, and he who declares her unfit declares her unfit even when most of the men are fit.
Yohanan says:
He who declares her fit declares also her daughter fit, and he who declares her unfit declares also her daughter unfit.
And R. Elazar says:
He who declares her fit declares her daughter unfit.
Rabbah said:
What is the reason of R. Elazar?
It is understandable with regard to her, she has the presumption of fitness, but her daughter has no presumption of fitness.
Elazar raised an objection to R. Yohanan:
This only applies to the testimony of the woman with regard to herself, but in the case of the testimony of the woman with regard to her daughter, all agree that the child is a shetuki.
Does this not mean a shetuki and unfit?
No, a shethuki and fit.
But is there such a thing as a shetuki who is fit?
Yes, according to Shmuel, for Shmuel said
If ten priests are standing together and one of them goes away and has intercourse with a woman, the child is a shetuki.
Now what does shetuki mean here?
Is it to say that he is “silenced” from the property of his father? This is obvious! Do we even know who his father is?
Rather it means that he is silenced from the rights of being a priest, for it is written: “And it shall be for him and for his seed after him the covenant of an everlasting priesthood” (Numbers 2513): ne whose seed legitimately descends from him, excluding this one, whose seed does not descend from him.
A betrothed couple once came before R. Joseph. She said, 
“It is from him.”  And he said: 


Daf 14a

“Yes. It is from me.”
Joseph said:
What should we be concerned about?
First, he admits, and moreover,
Rav Judah said that Shmuel said:
The halakhah is according to Rabban Gamaliel.
Abaye said to him:
And in this case, if he did not admit [that it was his], would Rabban Gamaliel declare fit?
Did not Shmuel say to Rav Judah:
Toothy one!
The halakhah is according to Rabban Gamaliel, but you should not act on it, unless most men are fit for her,
whereas here most men are unfit for her!
And according to your reasoning is not this statement in itself difficult? First he says 
‘The halackah is…” and then “do not act on it”!
Hence you must say:
The one ruling applies ab initio, the other ex post facto, and in this case it is ex post facto.
Abaye asked Rava:
Did R. Joshua say: She is not believed?
But this contradicts the following:
R. Joshua and R. Judah b. Batera testified concerning the widow [of one who was] of a mixed family that she is fit to marry a priest.
He said to him:
Now is this so?
There the woman marries, and she examines [his lineage] and [then] marries; but here the woman who is licentious; does she first examine and then act licentiously?
Rava said:
One statement of R. Joshua and the other statement of R. Joshua contradict each other, but one statement of Rabban Gamaliel does not contradict the other statement? 
But does not the concluding clause teach: Rabban Gamaliel said to them: 
We accept your testimony, but what can we do, since Rabban Yohanan b. Zakkai decreed that no court be set up for this purpose because the priests will obey you to distance but not to bring near?
Rather Rava said:
There is no contradiction between the statement of Rabban Gamaliel and the other statement of Rabban Gamaliel,
because there it is “certain” and here it is “perhaps.”
Neither is there a contradiction between the one statement of R. Joshua and the other statement of R. Joshua,
because in that case there is one doubt and here there is a double doubt.
Therefore, according to Rabban Gamaliel the “the certain” is so strong that even where there is only one doubt he declares her fit,
and the “perhaps” is so weak that even where there is a double doubt he declares her unfit.
And according to R. Joshua one doubt   is so strong that even in the case where she stakes a “certain” claim he declares her unfit, and a double doubt is so light that even in the case where she stakes a “perhaps” claim he declares her fit.
Our Rabbis taught:
Which is the widow of one of a mixed family? Anyone about whom there is no doubt on account of mamzerut, natinut or on account of slaves of the kings.
Meir said:

Daf 14b

I have heard that when there is none of these defects in the family, they may marry her into the priesthood.
Shimon b. Elazar said in the name of R. Meir and R. Shimon the son of Menasia also said it: 
Which is the widow of one of a mixed family? When a doubtful halal was mixed up in it,
for the Israelites know the mamzerim who are among them, but they do not know the halalim who are among them.
The Master said: 
Which is the widow of one of a mixed family? Anyone about whom there is no doubt on account of mamzerut, natinut or on account of slaves of the kings.
[By implication] if there is a doubt on account of a halal in the family she is fit. 
Why should these be different? Because these are Biblical? A halal is also Biblical.
And further: R. Meir said: 
I have heard that when there is none of these defects in the family they may marry her into the priesthood. This is the same as that which the first Tanna taught!
And further: R. Shimon b. Elazar said in the name of R. Meir and R. Shimon b. Menasia also said like him: 
Which is the widow of one of a mixed family? When a halal was mixed up in [his lineage], for the Israelites know the mamzerim who are among them, but they do not know the halalim who are among them. But it says in the first clause [that if there is a doubt regarding] a halal [in the family], she is fit to marry into the priesthood!
Yohanan said: 
There is a difference between them concerning a person who when he is called a mamzer protests and when he is called a halal is silent.
The first Tanna holds that every person who when called “unfit” is silent is considered unfit, and thus the first Tanna said:
Which is the widow of one of a mixed family? When with regard to her there is no one who is silent if he is called mamzer or natin, or slave of the king, or halal.
Our Rabbis taught: 
Which is the widow of one of a mixed family? Anyone about whom there is no doubt on account of mamzerut, natinut or on account of slaves of the kings.  
Meir said:
I have heard that when there is none of these defects in the family, they may marry her into the priesthood.
Shimon b. Elazar said in the name of R. Meir and R. Shimon the son of Menasia also said it:
Which is the widow of one of a mixed family? When a doubtful halal was mixed up in it, for the Israelites know the mamzerim who are among them, but they do not know the halalim who are among them.
The Master said: Which is the widow of one of a mixed family? Anyone about whom there is no doubt on account of mamzerut, natinut or on account of slaves of the kings.
And R. Shimon b. Elazar said to the first Tanna of R. Meir: 
If you have heard that R. Meir declares the person fit in the case of silence, this is not when he is called halal and is silent, but when he is called mamzer and is silent. And why is he silent? Because he says to himself. a mamzer is well-known.  
But if he is called mamzer and he protests or he is called halal and is silent he is unfit, for the reason he is silent is because he thinks,
it is enough if he is not excluded from the congregation.
One baraita taught: 
R. Yose says:If he is called mamzer and is silent, he is fit, and if he is called halal and is silent, he is unfit.
And another baraita taught: 
If he is called halal and is silent he is fit, but if he is called mamzer and is silent, he is unfit.
Rabbi Yose said:
it happened that a young girl went down to draw water from a spring and she was raped.
Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri said:
if most of the inhabitants of the town marry [their daughters] into the priesthood, this [girl] may [also] marry into the priesthood.
GEMARA. Rava said to R. Nahman:
According to whom did R. Yohanan b. Nuri say [his statement in the Mishnah]?
If according to Rabban Gamaliel, he declares her fit even when there is a majority of unfit!  And if it is according to R. Joshua, he declares her unfit even when there is a majority of fit! 
He said to him:
Rav Judah said that Rav said:

Daf 15a

The incident happened in the marketplaces of Tzippori, and this follows R. Ammi, 
for R. Ammi said:
And that is when a company of fit men passed by there, and it also follows R. Yannai
for R. Yannai said:
If she had intercourse in the marketplaces she is fit for the priesthood.
In the marketplaces, does that make sense?
Rather say:
If she had intercourse at the time of [the wagons arriving at] the marketplaces she is fit for the priesthood.
But if someone went out from Tzippori and had intercourse with her, the offspring is a shetuki.
Like the following: When R. Dimi came he said in the name of Ze’iri who said in the name of R. Hanina, and some say: Ze’iri said in the name of R. Hanina:
We go after the majority of the town and we do not go after the majority of the passing company.
Just the reverse!
These move about and these are stationary!
Rather
we go after the majority of the inhabitants of the town, but only when there is also the majority of the passing company with it,
but only when there is also the majority of the passing company with it, of the town alone, nor after the majority of the passing company alone.
What is the reason? It is a decree not to go after the majority of the passing company in order to prevent going after the majority of the inhabitants of the town.
But even in the case of the majority of the inhabitants of the town, if he, went to her, he who separates himself separates himself from the majority?  
It is only necessary when she went to him so that he was stationary, and R. Zera said:
All that is stationary is considered as half to half. 
But do we require two majorities?
Has it not been taught:
Nine [butcher] shops, all of them  sell ritually slaughtered meat and one sells meat not ritually slaughtered and he bought from one of them and he does not know from which one he bought it is prohibited because of the doubt.
But if [meat] was found, follow the majority?
And if you will say that this refers to a case when the gates of the city are not closed, so that a majority came also from outside, did not R. Zera say:
Even when the gates of the city are closed?
They added an extra degree of stringency in matters of lineage.
The text says: R. Zera said:
All that is stationary is considered as half to half. Whether this results in a leniency or in a stringency.
From where does R. Zera derive this?
If I say from [the following baraita]: nine butcher shops, all of them sell ritually slaughtered meat and one sells meat not ritually slaughtered and he bought in one of them and he does not know in which of them he bought, it is prohibited because of the doubt; But if [meat] was found, one goes after the majority? There it leads to a stringency!
Rather [he derives it] from [the following]: If there were nine frogs and one sheretz and he touches one of them and he does not know which of them he touched he is unclean because of the doubt?
There it also leads to a stringency.
But [rather] from [the following]: If there were nine sheratzim and one frog and he touches one of them and he does not know which of them he touched: In the private domain he is unclean because of the doubt; in a public domain, he is clean because of the doubt.
And how do we know this from the Torah?
The verse says: “And if he lie in wait for him and rise up against him.” [He is not guilty of murder] until he intended [to kill] him.
 And the Rabbis?
they said in the school of R. Yannai:
This excludes one who throws a stone into [a group of people].
What was the exact case?
What was the exact case? If you say there were nine non-Jews and one Israelite? Let it be sufficient for him that the majority are non-Jews.
Alternatively, if it was half and half, [the rule is that] when there is a doubt in capital cases one takes a lenient view!
Rather it is necessary when there were nine Israelites and one non-Jew, so that the non-Jew is stationary, and whatever is stationary is considered as half and half.
It was stated: R. Hiyya b. Ashi said in the name of Rav:
The halakhah follows R. Yose. And R. Hanan b. Rava said in the name of Rav:
It was a temporary decision.
Yirmiyah raised an objection: 
 And for matters of lineage we do not require two majorities?
Have we not learned: 

Daf 15b

If one found in it an abandoned child — if the majority were non-Jews [the child is] a non-Jew, if the majority are Jews [the child is] a Jew, half and half, [the child is] a Jew. 
And Rav said:
They have taught this only with regard to sustaining it, but not with regard to lineage. And Shmuel said:
[They have taught this only] with regard to removing stones from on top of it.








But did Shmuel really say this?
Did not R. Joseph say that R. Judah said in the name of Shmuel:
We do not follow the majority when it comes to saving a life?
Rather when Shmuel said it, it referred to the first clause:
If the majority [of the inhabitants of the town are] non-Jews [the child is] a non-Jew. [On this] Shmuel said:
And with regard to removing stones from on top of it.
If the majority [of the inhabitants of the town consist of] non-Jews [the child is] a non-Jew: For what practical purpose [was this taught]?
Papa said:
To feed him meat not ritually slaughtered.
If the majority [of the inhabitants of the town are] Jews [the child is] a Jew: For what practical purpose [is this taught]?
Papa said:
That one returns to him a lost object.
If [the inhabitants of the town are] half and half [the child is] Jewish: For what practical purpose [is this taught]?
Resh Lakish said:
With regard to damages.  
What is the exact case?
If it was an ox of ours that gored an ox of his?  
[In this case] let him say to him: “Bring evidence that you are an Israelite — and take!”
Rather it is necessary when an ox of his gored an ox of ours:
One half he pays, and with regard to the other half he says to them:
“Bring evidence that I am not an Israelite and I will pay you.”
May we return to you “A virgin is wedded.”
A woman became a widow or was divorced. She says, 
“I was a virgin when you married me” and he says, 
“Not so, rather you were a widow when I married you”, —
If there are witnesses that she went out with a hinuma, and with her head uncovered, her ketubah is two hundred [zuz.]  
Rabbi Yohanan ben Beroka says:
the distribution of roasted ears of corn is also evidence.
And Rabbi Joshua admits that, if one says to his fellow,
“This field belonged to your father and I bought it from him”, he is believed,

Daf 16a

for the mouth that forbade is the mouth that permitted.
But if there are witnesses that it belonged to his father and he says,
“I bought it from him”, he is not believed.
GEMARA. The reason is that there are witnesses, but if there are no witnesses the husband is believed.
Shall we say that it is taught anonymously not according to Rabban Gamaliel? For if it were according to Rabban Gamaliel, did not he say that she is believed?
You may even say [that it accords with] Rabban Gamaliel: for Rabban Gamaliel says [it]  only there in a case of “certain” and “perhaps.” But here where they are both “certain” he did not say it.
But now that you have said that, why did you say that?
Clearly this is a case where they are both “certain”! 
Since most women get married as virgins [you might say that] it is like “certain and perhaps.”
This is also reasonable from that which it teaches
“and Rabbi Joshua agrees.”    
If you say that it refers to Rabban Gamaliel with whom he agrees, then it is understandable. But if you say it does not refer to Rabban Gamaliel with whom he agrees, then with whom does R. Joshua agree?
Do you think [that] R. Joshua refers to this chapter?
He refers to a “miggo” in the first chapter.
To which [does he refer]?
If you [that he refers] to this:
If she was pregnant, and they said to her:
What is the nature of this fetus?
[And she answered: It is] from So-and-so and he is a priest. 
Rabban Gamaliel and R. Eliezer say:
She is believed, [and] R. Joshua says:
We do not live from her mouth! What miggo is there in that case?
 Behold, her stomach reaches up to her teeth!  
Rather, it [might] refer to this:
They saw her talking with someone 
and they said to her: “What is the nature of this man?”
[And she answered, “He is] So-and-so and he is a priest.”
Rabban Gamaliel and R. Eliezer say:
She is believed. And R. Joshua says:
We do not live from her mouth. 
What miggo is there in that case?
This works for Ze’iri, who says
[that] “she was talking” means “she was secluded [with a man].” [In which case she has] a miggo, for if she wished she could say, “I did not have intercourse” and [still] she said, “I had intercourse,” [therefore] she is believed.
But according to R. Assi,
who says that
“she was talking” means “she had intercourse,” what miggo is there?
Rather, he might refer to this:
She says,
“I was injured by [a piece of] wood,” and he says. 
“Not so, rather you were trampled [i.e. had sex] with a man.” 
Rabban Gamaliel and R. Eliezer say:
She is believed, and R. Joshua says:
We do not live from her mouth.  
What miggo is there?
This works according to R. Eliezer, who says that [the dispute between the husband and the wife is] with regard to a maneh and nothing. She has] a miggo, for if she wished she could have said, “I was injured by a piece of wood under you [after betrothal],”  and she would get two hundred [zuz], and [still] she said [that she was injured] earlier, [therefore] she is believed.
But according to R. Yohanan who says that
[the dispute between the husband and the wife is] with regard to two hundred and a maneh, what miggo is there? 
Rather he refers to this:
If one has married a woman and has not found her to be a virgin [and] she says, 
“After you betrothed me I was raped and your field was flooded,”
and he says,
‘Not so, but rather it happened before I betrothed you.”
Rabban Gamaliel and R. Eliezer say:
She is believed, and R. Joshua says:
 We do not live from her mouth.
For [here there is] a miggo, because if she wished she could say, “I was injured by a piece of wood after betrothal,” and [by saying this] she would not make herself unfit for the priesthood and [still] she said, “I have been raped,” and she makes herself unfit for the priesthood; therefore Rabban Gamaliel said that she is believed.
And R. Joshua said to Rabban Gamaliel: 
With regard to this miggo here, I agree with you, but with regard to that miggo there, I disagree with you.
Now, this is a miggo and that is a miggo, what difference is there between this miggo and that miggo?
Here there is no slaughtered ox before you, there, there is a slaughtered ox before you.
But since most women get married as virgins, [even] if no witnesses came, why is that important?
Ravina said:
Because one could say, most women are married as virgins and a minority as widows.
And whenever a virgin gets married, it has a voice, 

Daf 16b

and since this one does not have a voice, [the presumption that she belonged to] the majority has been undermined.
But if [you maintain that] whenever a virgin gets married she has a voice, [then even] when witnesses come, what of it?
They are false witnesses!
Rather Ravina said:
Most marriages of virgins have a voice, and [in the case of] this one, since there is no voice, [the presumption that she belonged to] the majority has been undermined.
If there are witnesses that she went out with a veil (himuna), etc.
But let us be concerned that she might produce witnesses before this court and collect her ketubah and then later produce the ketubah before another court and collect [a second time] by that [document]!
Abbahu said:
That is to say
they write a receipt.
Rav Papa said:
We are dealing with a place where they do not write a ketubah.
Some teach this with regard to the following baraita:
If she lost her ketubah document, or she hid it, or it was burned: If they danced before her, played before her, passed before her the cup of [glad] tidings, or the cloth of virginity, if she has witnesses with regard to one of these, her ketubah is two hundred [zuz].
But let us be concerned that perhaps she might produce witnesses before this court and collect her ketubah and then later produce the ketubah before another court and collect [a second time] by that [document]!
Abbahu said:
That is to say
they write a receipt.
Rav Papa said:
We are dealing with a place where they do not write a ketubah.
But does it not say “If she lost her ketubah document”?
He wrote her [one].
But in the end, she will still produce it and collect [her kethubah a second time] with it!
What does it mean “she lost [it]”? [It means:] “she lost [it] in fire.”  
If so, it is the same as “it was burned!”
Furthermore,
what can you say with regard to “she hid [it]?”  
And furthermore,
why [mention] “she lost [it]”?
Rather [this is what the baraita means]:
If she lost it, it is as if she had hidden it before us, and we do not give her [the ketubah money] until witnesses say [that] her ketubah document has been burned.
He who teaches this in reference to the baraita, all the more [does he refer it] to the Mishnah. But he who teaches this in reference to our Mishnah [does] not [teach it] in reference to the baraita, because of the difficulty.
If there are witnesses, etc. But let us be concerned that perhaps she might produce witnesses of the veil before this court and collect [her ketubah] and [later] she might produce [other] witnesses of the veil before another court and collect [her ketubah a second time]!
In a case where it is not possible otherwise, we certainly write a receipt.
“[If] they passed before her the cup of glad tidings.”
What is the cup of [glad] tidings?
Rav Adda the son of Ahava said:
They pass before her a cup of wine of terumah, as if to say,
“This one is worthy of eating terumah.”
Rav Papa raised an objection:
Does not a widow eat terumah?  
Rather Rav Papa said [as if to say]:
This one is “first” just as terumah is “first”. 
It has been taught: R. Judah says:
They pass before her a cask of wine.
Rav Adda the son of Ahava said:
[If she was] a virgin they pass before her a closed one, [and if] she had had intercourse with a man they pass before her an open one.
Why?
Let us pass [a cask of wine] before a virgin and let us not pass [a cask of wine] at all before one who had intercourse?
[It could happen] some times that she would seize two hundred [zuz] and [then] say,
“I was a virgin and they did not pass [a cask of wine] before me because they were prevented by an accident.”
Our rabbis taught:
How does one dance before the bride?
Bet Shammai say:

Daf 17a

The bride as she is. And Bet Hillel say:
“A beautiful and graceful bride”!
Bet Shammai said to Bet Hillel:
If she was lame or blind, does one say of her, “Beautiful and graceful bride”?
Whereas the Torah said, “Keep away from a lie” (Exodus 23:7).
Bet Hillel said to Bet Shammai:
According to your words, if one has made a bad purchase in the market, should one praise it in front of him or denigrate it?
Surely, one should praise it in front of him.
Therefore, the sages said:
One should always have a pleasing disposition in front of other people.
When Rav Dimi came, he said:
Thus they sing before the bride in the West:
No blue makeup and no rouge and no braiding [of the hair], and still a graceful gazelle.
When the Rabbis ordained R. Zera they sang before him:
No blue makeup and no rouge and no braiding [of the hair], and still a graceful gazelle.
When the Rabbis ordained R. Ammi and R. Assi they sang before them thus:
All such as this, and all such as this ordain for us, but do not ordain for us of those who garble or babble, and some say: of the one-fifth scholars or one-third-scholars. 
When R. Abbahu came from the Yeshiva to the court of the Emperor, handmaids from the Emperor’s house went out towards him and sang before him thus:
“Prince of his people, leader of his nation, shining light, blessed be your coming in peace!”
They tell of R. Judah b. Ilai that he used to take a myrtle twig and dance before the bride and say:
“Beautiful and graceful bride.”
Rav Shmuel the son of Rav Yitzchak danced with three [twigs].  
Zera said:
The old man is putting us to shame.
When he died, a pillar of fire came between him and the rest of the world. And we have a tradition that a pillar of fire has made such a separation only either for one in a generation or for two in a generation only. 
Zera said:
His twig (shotiteh) [benefited] the old man, and some say:
His craziness (shtuteh) [benefited] the old man, and some say:
his method (shitateh) [benefited] the old man
Rav Aha took her on his shoulder and danced [with her].
The Rabbis said to him:
Can we also do this?
He said to them:
If they are like a beam to you, [then it is] permitted and if not, [you may] not.
Shmuel b. Nahmani said [that] R. Yonatan said:
It is permitted to look at the face of the bride all the seven days in order to make her beloved to her husband.
But the halakhah is not according to him.
Our Rabbis taught:
They move aside a funeral procession to make way for a bridal procession, and both of them for the King of Israel. 
They said of King Agrippa that he made way for a bride, and the sages praised him.
They praised him,
from this we can conclude that what he did was appropriate.
But did not R. Ashi say:
Even according to he who says [that] if a prince forgoes his honor, his honor is forgone, if a king forgoes his honor, his honor is not forgone
for a Master said:
You shall set over yourself a king” (Deuteronomy 17:15) [this means] that his awe shall be over your? 
It was [at] a crossroads.
Our Rabbis taught:
One interrupts the study of the Torah for the sake of a funeral procession and bringing the bride [into the huppah].
They said about R. Judah b. Ila’i that he would interrupt the study of Torah for the sake of a funeral procession and bringing the bride [into the huppah].
When is this so? When there are not sufficient people at the funeral procession,   but if there are sufficient people one does not interrupt [the study of the Torah].
And how many are sufficient?
R. Shmuel the son of Ini said in the name of Rav:
Twelve thousand men and six thousand trumpets.
And some say:
Twelve thousand men and among them six thousand trumpets.
Ulla said:
For instance when people form a line from the city-gate to the burial place.
Sheshet, and some say R. Yohanan said: 
Its taking away is like its giving. Just as its giving was in [the presence of] sixty myriads of people, so its taking away should be in [the presence of] sixty myriads of people.
And this is the case only with regard to one who read [the Bible] and recited [the oral Torah.]  

Daf 17b

But there is no measure for one who teaches [the oral Torah].
And if there are witnesses that she went out with a hinuma etc. What is hinuma?
Surhab b. Papa said in the name of Ze’iri:
A myrtle-canopy. Yohanan said:
 A veil under which the bride naps.
Yohanan ben Beroka says, etc.
It was taught:
This was [regarded as] a proof in Judaea.
What is the proof in Babylonia?
Rav said:
The dripping of oil on the heads of the scholars. 
Papa said to Abaye:
Did the master refer to oil [used] for cleaning [the head]?
He said to him:
You orphan, did your mother not do the dripping of the oil on the heads of the scholars at the time of the event?
As that [case when] one of the scholars was occupied with the wedding of his son in the house of Rabbah b. Ulla,
and some say, Rabbah b. Ulla was occupied with the wedding of his son in the house of one of the scholars, and he dripped oil on the heads of the scholars at the time of the event.
What [sign is there at the wedding of] a widow?
Joseph taught: 
A widow has no roasted ears of grain [distributed at her wedding].
And R. Joshua agrees that if one says to his fellow etc.
But let him teach:
R. Joshua agrees that if one says to his fellow, “This field belonged to you and I have bought it from you” [he is believed]?
Because he would have to teach [in] the last clause:
If there are witnesses that it was his and he says,
“I have bought it from you” he is not believed.
[And] what was this case?
If he ate [the produce of] it [during the] years of hazakah why should he not be believed?
And if he did not eat [the produce of] it [during the] years of hazakah it is obvious that he is not believed!
If so, with regard to his father also [one could argue]: If he ate [the produce of] it [during the] years of hazakah
why should he not be believed?   And if he did not eat [the produce of] it [during the] years of hazakah, it is obvious that he is not believed!
It works with regard to [the field belonging to] his father, [because] it could happens for instance, when he ate [the produce of] it two [years] during the life of the father and one [year] during the life of his son. And [this would be] according to R. Huna, 
for R. Huna said:
One does not acquire the ownership of the property of a minor through hazakah even if [he continued in the possession after] the minor had become of age.
But does R. Huna comes to teach [what is already taught In] our Mishnah!
If you wish you may say,
R. Huna says what is to be derived from our Mishnah by implication.
And if you wish, you may say,
 “He teaches us, even if he had become of age.”
But let him teach with regard to himself and stand the case where he ate [the fruits of] it two [years] in his presence and one [year] in his absence, and, for instance, when he fled?
Because of what did he flee? 
If he fled because of [danger to his] life, it is obvious that he is not believed. since he cannot protest!
And if he fled because of money [matters] he ought to have protested because we hold [that] a protest in his absence is a [valid] protest! 
For we have learned: 
There are three regions with regard to hazakah: Judea, Trans-Jordan and Galilee. 
[If] he was in Judea and someone took possession [of his land] in Galilee, [or he was] in Galilee and someone took possession [of his land] in Judea, it is not a hazakah until he is with him in the [same] province.
And we asked concerning this, 
what does he hold?
If he holds that a protest in his absence is a [valid] protest, this should apply also to Judaea and Galilee.  
And if he holds [that] a protest in his absence is not a [valid] protest, it should not he [a valid protest] even if they are both in Judaea?
Abba bar Mamel says: 
He always holds that a protest in his absence is a valid protest,
but our Mishnah refers to a time of emergency.
And why are Judea and the Galilee different such that he mentions them?

Daf 18a

For in general Judea and the Galilee are like a time of emergency.
But let it teach:
R. Joshua admits that when one says to his fellow,
“I borrowed from you a maneh and paid it back to you” he is believed!
Because he would have to teach in the last clause:
“If there are witnesses that he borrowed from him [a maneh] and he says ‘I have paid it back,’ he is not believed.”
But we hold the principle that if one lends money to his fellow in front of witnesses, he need not pay it back to him before witnesses.
But let him teach:
R. Joshua admits that if one says to his fellow,
“I owed to your father a maneh and I returned to him half,” he is believed! 
According to whose opinion?
 If according to the opinion of the Rabbis. surely they say [that he is regarded as] one who returns a lost thing, [and] if according to R. Eliezer b. Yaakov.  Surely he says that he must take an oath! 
For it has been taught: R. Eliezer b. Yaakov says:
Sometimes a person has to take an oath because of his own statement.
How so? 
[If one says to his fellow], ‘I owed your father a maneh and I returned to him half,” he must take an oath. And this is [a case] where one takes an oath because of his own statement. 
But the Sages say: 
He is only as one who returns a lost thing and he is exempt.
And does R. Eliezer b. Jacob not hold [that] one who returns a lost thing is exempt [from an oath]? 
Rav said: 
[It speaks here of a case] when a minor claimed from him.
But did not a Master say:
One does not take an oath because of a claim by a deaf-mute, a person lacking sound senses, or a minor? 
What is [meant by] “minor”? An adult, and why does he call him a “minor”? Because with regard to the affairs of his father he is [regarded as] a minor.
If so, [it is not] “his own statement?” 
It is a claim made by others!
It is a claim [made] by others and [also] his own admission.
But all claims are really a claim made by others and one’s own admission!
They differ here with regard to [an opinion of] Rabbah, 
for Rabbah said: 
Why did the Torah say that he who admits a part of the claim must take an oath? [Because] it is assumed that no man is brazen in the face of his creditor. 
He would indeed like to deny the whole debt. But he does not deny the whole debt because no one is so brazen.

Daf 18b

He would like to admit that he owes the whole debt, and the reason he does not admit, is that he would like to elude him [for the time being]. And he thinks,
“as soon as I will have money I will pay it,”
and [therefore] the Torah said: 
Impose an oath on him, so that he should admit the whole of it.
Eliezer b. Jacob holds [that]
he is not brazen against him nor against his son, and therefore he is not like one who returns a lost thing.
And the Rabbis hold [that] 
against him he is not brazen, but against his son he might be brazen, and since he is not brazen, he is like one who returns a lost thing.
 If witnesses said,
“This is our handwriting, but we were forced, [or] we were minors, [or] we were disqualified witnesses” they are believed.  
But if there are witnesses that it is their handwriting, or their handwriting comes out from another place, they are not believed. 
GEMARA. Rami b. Hama said:
They taught this only when they said: We were forced by threats with regard to money. But if they said we were forced [by threats] to our life, they are believed.
Rava said to him: 
Does he really have this power?
Once he has once testified he cannot again testify!
And if you will say [that]
this applies only to oral testimony but not to testimony in a document, did not Resh Lakish say:
If witnesses are signed on a document it is as if their testimony had been examined in court?
Rather, if it has been said, it has been said with regard to the first clause:
they are believed. Rami b. Hama said: 
They taught this only when they said,
“We were forced [by threats] to [our] life.” But if they said,
We were forced [by threats] with regard to money” they are not believed because no one makes himself out to be wicked.
Our rabbis taught:
They are not believed to disqualify it, the words of R. Meir.
But the Sages say [that]
they are believed.
This goes well according to the rabbis, who follow their reasoning, “the mouth that prohibits is the mouth that permits,”
but what is the reason of R. Meir?
It works [with regard to] those disqualified from testifying [because] the creditor himself checks beforehand and [then] he signs.
With regard to] “minors” also [it can be explained] according to R. Shimon ben Lakish. for Resh Lakish said:

Daf 19a

It is a presumption that the witnesses do not sign a document unless [everything] was done by adults.
But when it comes to “we were under duress” what is his reasoning?
Hisda said:
R. Meir holds that
if one said to witnesses, “sign a falsehood and you will not be killed,” they should rather be killed and not sign a falsehood.
Rava said to him:
Now. if they would come to us to ask advice, we would say to them:
Go [and] sign and do not be killed,
for a Master said:
“There is nothing that comes before the saving of life except idolatry, fornication and murder.” 
Now that they have signed, can we say to them: why have you signed? 
Rather the reason of R. Meir is in accordance with what R. Huna that Rav said:
for R. Huna said that Rav said:
If he  admits that he has written the document, there is no need  to confirm it.
[To revert to] the main text: R. Huna said that Rav said:
If he admits that he has written the document, there is no need to confirm it.
Nahman said to him: 
Why do you say this in a sneaky way? 
If you hold with R. Meir, say:
the halakhah is according to R. Meir.
He said to him:
And how does the Master [you], hold? 
He said to him:
When they come before us in court, we say to them:
go [and] confirm your documents and [then] come to court.
Rav Judah said that Rav said:
If one said: This is a loan document of trust he is not believed.
Who said it?
If the debtor said it, it is obvious; why should he be believed?
If the creditor said it, may a blessing come upon him!
Rather, the witnesses said it.
If their handwriting comes out from another place, it is obvious that they are not believed,
and if their handwriting does not come out from another place, why should they not be believed?
Mnemonic: BASH)  Rava said: 
Indeed, the debtor said [it], and [it is] follows R. Huna,
for R. Huna said that Rav said:
If he admits that he has written the document, there is no need to confirm it.
Abaye said:
Indeed, the creditor said it, and it is a case where he would cause a debt to others.
And it follows R. Natan, for it has been taught: R. Nathan says:
From where [do we learn that], if one has a claim of a maneh against his fellow and that fellow against another fellow, we take from this one and give it to that one? Scripture says, “And he shall give to whom he owes” (Numbers 5:7).
Ashi said:
Indeed, the witnesses said it, and [it is in a case] where their handwriting does not come out from another place;
and when you asked why should they not be believed, it is as stated by R. Kahana, for R. Kahana said:
It is forbidden for a man to keep a loan deed of trust in his house, because it is said: “Let not unrighteousness dwell in your tents” (Job 11:14).

Daf 19b

And R. Sheshet the son of R. Idi said:
From [the words of] R. Kahana we can learn [the following]: Witnesses who said,
“Our words were [regarding a matter of] trust,” they are not believed,
or this reason: Since it is “unrighteousness,” [we say that] on unrighteousness they would not have signed.
Joshua b. Levi. said:
It is forbidden for a man to keep a paid bill of debt in his house, because it is said: “Let not unrighteousness dwell in your tents.”
In the West they said in the name of Rav: [It is said]:
“If iniquity be in your hand, put it far away” (Job 11:14) this refers to a loan deed of trust and a deed of sale for accommodation; [and it is said]: “And let not unrighteousness dwell in your tents” (ibid). This is a paid bill of debt.
He who says [that it applies to] a paid bill of debt, how much more [does it apply to] a loan deed of trust. But he, who says [that it applies to] a loan deed of trust, [would hold that it does not apply to] a paid bill of debt, because sometimes they keep it on account of the scribe’s fees.
It was stated: A scroll that has not been corrected: Ami said:
For thirty days one is allowed to hold on to it, from that point and onward, it is forbidden to hold on to it, because it is said: “Let not unrighteousness dwell in your tents.”
Nahman said:
Witnesses who said, “Our words were [regarding a matter of] trust” are not believed. [If they said], “Our words were [accompanied by a] declaration,” they are [also] not believed.
Mar the son of R. Ashi said:
[If witnesses said] “Our words were [regarding a matter of] trust,” they are not believed; [But if they said], “Our words were [accompanied by] a declaration,” they are believed.
What is the reason? 
This one was allowed to be written and that one was not allowed to be written.
Rava asked of R. Nahman:
[If witnesses say], “Our words were [accompanied by] a condition,” what is the law?
 “A declaration” and “trust” are not believed because they overturn [the validity] of the document, and this overturns [the validity] of the document?
Or perhaps
“condition” is a different situation?
He said to him:
When they come before us in court, we say to them:
go fulfill your conditions and then come to court.
If one witness says [that there was]
a condition, and one witness says
[that there was] no condition: R. Papa said:
They both testify to a valid document and only one says [that there was] a condition, and the words of one [witness] have no value where there are two witnesses.
Huna the son of R. Joshua objected:
If so, even if they both say [that there was a condition] [their words should] also [have no value]!
Rather we say [that]
they have come to uproot their testimony, and this one also comes to uproot his testimony.
And the law is according to R. Huna the son of R. Joshua.
Our rabbis taught:
If two [witnesses] were signed on a document and died, and two [other witnesses] came from the street and said,
“We know that it is their handwriting, but they were forced, they were minors, or they were disqualified witnesses,” they are believed.
But if there are other witnesses that this is their handwriting or their handwriting comes out from another place, from a document which was challenged and then confirmed in a court of law, they are not believed.
And we collect with it as with a valid document? 
Why?
They are two and two!
Sheshet:
This teaches [that] contradiction is the beginning of rebuttal, 

Daf 20a

and just as witnesses can be rebutted only in their presence, so too they can be contradicted only in their presence.
Nahman said to him:
If they had been before us and [the other two witnesses] had contradicted them, it  would have been a contradiction,  and we would not have paid any attention to them, because it  is a contradicted testimony.
Now that they are not here, and perhaps if they had been before us, they might [even] have admitted to them, why should they be believed?
Rather R. Nahman said;
set the two [witnesses] against the two [witnesses] and leave the property in the possession of its master.
This is like the case of the property of a certain lunatic.
A certain lunatic sold property.
Two came and said that
he sold [the property] when he was insane, and two came and said that
he sold [the property] when he was sane.
R. Ashi said:
Set the two [witnesses] against the two [witnesses] and leave the property in the possession of the lunatic.
And we say this only when he has the presumption of ownership from his ancestors, but if he does not have the presumption of ownership of his ancestors, we say that
he bought [the property] when he was insane and that he sold [it] when he was insane. 
Abbahu said:
They rebut witnesses only in their presence, but they contradict them also in not in their presence.
And a rebuttal in their absence — granted that it does not count as rebuttal, but it does count as contradiction.
The Master said [above]:
If there are witnesses that this is their handwriting, or their handwriting came out from another place, [namely] from a document which was contested and was confirmed in court, they are not believed.”
If it was contested, but not if it was not contested.  This is a support for R. Assi, for R. Assi said: 
They uphold a document only from a document which was contested and was confirmed in court.
The Nehardeans say:
A document is confirmed only from two ketubot or from two fields, and [only] when their owners used them for three years, and in comfort.
Shimi b. Ashi said:
And only when it is produced by another person, but not [if it is produced] by himself.
What is the difference if he himself produces it? Because he may have forged [the signatures of the witnesses]. [If so] even when produced by another person also, perhaps he went and saw [the signatures] and forged [them]?
All of this, it is too difficult to direct [his handwriting].
Our Rabbis taught:
A person may write [down] his testimony in a document and may through it give evidence even after some years.
Huna said:
Only when he remembers it by himself.Only when he remembers it by himself.
Yohanan said: 
Even if he does not remember it by himself.
Rabbah said:
Learn from [the words of] R. Yohanan [the following]:
These two people who know evidence and one of them has forgotten it, the other one may remind him of it.
They asked:
In the case of the litigant himself what is the law? 
Haviva said:
Even he himself may do so.
Mar b. R. Ashi said: 
He himself may not.
And the law is:
He himself may not.

Daf 20b

But if he is a scholar even he himself may remind the witness. 
As that case of R. Ashi who knew evidence for R. Kahana,
and he (R. Kahana) said to him (R. Ashi):
Does the master remember that evidence? 
And he said to him:
No. 
But was it not so and so?
He replied:
I do not know.
In the end, R. Ashi remember, and he testified for him. 
He saw that R. Kahana was surprised,
so he said to him:
Do you think that I relied upon you? I took it on myself and I remembered it.
We taught elsewhere: 
Those mounds which are near, whether to a town or a road, both new and old, are unclean. Those which are distant: If they are new, they are clean,
 and if they are old, they are unclean.  
What is near?
Fifty cubits. And what is old?
Sixty years,
the words of R. Meir.
Judah says:
“Near”—when there is none nearer; “old,” when no one remembers it.
What is a town and what is a road?
If I say: A town actually means a town, and a road is actually a road, do we presume uncleanness out of doubt?
Did not Resh Lakish say:
They found some pretext and purified the land of Israel?
Zera:
A town—this is a town which is near a burial place, 
and a road—this is a road [leading] to a burial place.
This makes sense [in the case of] a road [leading] to a burial place, because sometimes it might happen [that a funeral took place] at twilight, and that they buried it in the mound.
But [in the case of] a town which is near a burial place, all go to the burial place!   
Hanina said:
Because women bring there their abortions and lepers their arms. [And it is assumed that] to a distance of fifty cubits she goes alone, but for a longer distance she takes a man with her and [then] she goes to the burial place.
Therefore, we do not presume uncleanness in Eretz Israel.
Hisda said:
Learn from [the words of] R. Meir:
This testimony, for sixty years one will remember it, for longer one does not remember.
But this is not so:
There [he does not remember the evidence after sixty years] because it is not his concern, but here, since it has been given to him [as a responsibility], even for a longer [period he] also [remembers the evidence].
1) [If] one witness says,
“This is my handwriting and that is the handwriting of my fellow”, and the other [witness] says,
“This is my handwriting and that is the handwriting of my fellow”, they are believed.
2) [If] one says,
“This is my handwriting” and the other says,
“This is my handwriting” they must join to themselves another [person], the words of Rabbi [Judah Hanasi].
But the Sages say:
They need not join to themselves another [person], rather a person is believed to say,
“this is my handwriting.
When you think about it, according to Rabbi [Judah Hanasi]  

Daf 21a

they give evidence with regard to their handwriting, according to the Sages they give evidence with regard to the maneh in the deed.
This is obvious!
You might have said 
that Rebbe was in doubt whether they testified to their signature or to the maneh in the deed.
And the ramification would be
when one of them died. [Here] we would need two witnesses from the street to testify regarding it, because otherwise the [whole of the money] less a quarter would go out by the mouth of one witness, 
and both here and there the stricter rule would prevail.
Therefore, he teaches that it is clear to Rebbe, whether the result is lenient or strict.
For Rav Judah said that Rav said:
If two [witnesses] are signed on a document and one of them died, two from the street must give evidence with regard to him. In this case Rebbe would be lenient and the Rabbis would be strict.
And if there are not two, but there is only one, what [then]?
Abaye said:
He [the second witness] writes his signature on a piece of clay and places it before the court, and the court confirms it, and he need not testify to his own signature, and he goes with that one and they testify to [the signature of] the other [witness].
And specifically only on a piece of clay but not a scroll, lest a person of bad character find it and write on it whatever he likes, and we have learned: 
If one person produces the handwriting   of another person that he owes him [money], he collects [the debt] from unencumbered property.
Rav Judah said [that] Shmuel said.
The halakhah is according to the sages  
This is obvious! A singular sage and the many–the halakhah follows the many.
What might you have thought:
Since the halakhah follows Rebbe as against one of his fellow-scholars, it is also against many of his fellow-scholars, that is why he teaches us.
(Mnemonic: Nah, Nad, Had)
R. Hinena b. Hiyya said to R. Judah, and some say R. Huna b. Judah said to Rav Judah, and some say R. Hiyya b. Judah said to Rav Judah:
Did Shmuel really say this?
Surely there once was a document that came out of the court of Mar Shmuel and there was written in it: 
When R. Anan b. Hiyya came and testified to his own signature and to that of his fellow-witness, namely, R. Hanan b. Rabbah, and when R. Hanan b. Rabbah came and testified to his own signature and to that of his fellow-witness, namely R. Anan b. Hiyya, we verified it, and we have confirmed it, as it is proper!
He said to him:
That deed belonged to orphans, and Shmuel was concerned of an errant court,
and Shmuel thought:
Lest there be someone who held that the halakhah is [generally] according to Rebbe against one fellow-scholar, and not against many of his fellow-scholars but [that] in this [the halakhah is according to Rebbe] even against many of his fellow-scholars,
I will leave some room, so that the orphans should not suffer any loss.
Rav Judah said that Shmuel said:
A witness and judge can be joined together [to create one set of witnesses].
Rami b. Hama said: 
How excellent is this tradition!
Rava said:
What is the excellence?
What the witness testifies to the judge does not testify to, and what the judge testifies to the witness does not testify to?.
Rather, when Rami b. Ezekiel came he said:
Do not listen to those rules which my brother Judah laid down in the name of Shmuel.

Daf 21b

Rabbanai, the brother of R. Hiyya b. Abba, came to buy sesame and he said:
Thus Shmuel said:
Witness and judge are joined together.
Amemar said:
How excellent is this tradition!
Ashi said to Amemar: 
Because the father of your mother praised it, you also praise it!
Rava has already refuted it.
Safra said that R. Abba said that R. Isaac b. Shmuel b. Martha said that R. Huna said, and some say that R. Huna said that Rav said: 
Three that sat together to uphold a document, and two of them know the signatures of the witnesses and one does not know, before they sign, they may testify before him, and he  then signs  with them; after they have signed, they may not testify before him and he may not sign.  
But do we write the attestation [to such a document]? 
Did not R. Papi say in the name of Rava:
The judge’s attestation which is written before the witnesses give evidence as to their signatures is invalid, because it looks like a lie? 
And here also it looks like a lie!
Rather say:
Before they have written the attestation they may testify before him and he then signs with them; after they have written the attestation, they may not testify before him and he may not sign.
Learn from this three things:
Learn from this that...
a witness may be  a judge;
Learn from this tha...
if the judges know the signatures of the witnesses, here is no need to testify before them;
and learn from this that 
if the judges do not know the signatures of the witnesses, it is necessary to testify before every one
Ashi raised a difficulty on this:
It makes sense that we learn from this that a witness may be a judge, 
but [how can we learn that] if the judges know the signatures of the witnesses, there is no need to testify before them? Perhaps I could say to you
that this is [generally] necessary, but it is different here, because the telling has been fulfilled before one.
And [how can we learn that] if the judges do not know the signatures of the witnesses, it is necessary to give evidence before every one?  Perhaps I could say to you...
 that this is not necessary, but it is different here, because the telling would not have been fulfilled at all.
Abba sat and said this tradition, that a witness may be a judge.
Safra objected to R. Abba:
If three saw it and they are the court, two shall stand up and seat two of their colleagues beside the one, and they shall testify before them, and [then] they say: Sanctified is the new moon, sanctified; for one person is not believed by himself.
Now, if you should think that a witness may be a judge, why go through all this?
Let them sit in their places and sanctify [the new moon]!
He said to him:
That was also difficult to me, and I asked R. Yitzchak b. Shmuel b. Martha. and R. Yitzchak [asked] R. Huna, and R. Huna [asked] Hiyya b. Rav, and Hiyya b. Rav [asked] Rav, and he said to them:
Leave alone the testimony as to the new moon, [for it is] biblical, and the upholding of documents is rabbinic.
Abba said [that] R. Huna said [that] Rav said:
If three sit to uphold a document and an objection was raised against one of them: If before they have signed [the attestation], they may give evidence regarding him, and he may [then] sign; after they have signed, they may not give evidence regarding him and he may not sign.
What was the nature of the protest?
If the protest was on the grounds of robbery,


Daf 22a

they are two and two. [And] if it is a protest regarding family blemish, then it just a matter of revealing the truth.
In any case, I can tell you,
it is a protest regarding robbery, and these say:
We know of him that he has repented.
Zera said:
This matter I have heard from R. Abba, and if not for R. Abba of Acco, I would have forgotten it:
If three sit to confirm a document and one of them dies, they must write,
“We were in a session of three, and one is no more.”
Nahman b. Yitzchak said:
And if it is written in it: This document has been produced before us [as] a court of law, they need not do anymore
But perhaps it was an arrogant court, and it follows Shmuel,
for Shmuel said:
If two have judged, their judgment is a judgment, only they are called an arrogant court?
When it is written in it,
“The court of our Master Ashi.”  
But perhaps the scholars of the school of R. Ashi hold like Shmuel?
When it is written in it,...
“And our Master Ashi told us.”
If a woman says,...
“I was married and I am divorced”, she is believed, for the mouth that forbade is the mouth that permitted.
But if there are witnesses that she was married, and she says,
“I am divorced”, she is not believed.
If she says,
“I was taken captive but I have remained clean”, she is believed, for the mouth that forbade is the mouth that permitted.
But if there are witnesses that she was taken captive and she says,
“I have remained clean” she is not believed.
But if the witnesses came after she had married, she shall not go out.
Assi said:
From where in the Torah is [the principle of] “the mouth that forbade is the mouth that permits”?
Because it is said: “My daughter I gave to this man as a wife” (Deuteronomy 22:16): “To a man” he made her forbidden, “This,” he made her permitted.
Why do I need a verse?
It is logic—
he made her forbidden, and he made her permitted!
Rather, the verse is required according to what R. Huna said in the name of Rav,...
or R. Huna said in the name of Rav: 
From where do we know from the Bible that the father is believed to make his daughter forbidden? Because it is said: “My daughter I gave to [this] man as his wife.”
Why do I need the word “this”? It is required for what R. Jonah taught, for R. Jonah taught:
“My daughter I gave to this man”: “To this”, and not to the brother-in-law.
Our Rabbis taught:
If a woman says,
“I am married,”and then she says,
“I am unmarried,” she is believed.
But she made herself forbidden!
Rava the son of R. Huna said:
When she has given a plausible reason for her words.
It was also taught in a baraita:
If she says,
I am married’, and then she says,
‘I am unmarried’, she is not believed, but if she gives a plausible reason for her words, she is believed. And so it once happened with a great woman, who was great in beauty, and men were eager   to betroth her, and she said to them,
“I am betrothed.”
After some time she betrothed herself. 
The Sages said to her:
Why did you do this?
She answered them,
“At first, when unworthy men came to me, I said, “I am betrothed”; now that worthy men come to me, I betrothed myself.”
And this law R. Aha, the officer of the castle, brought before the Sages in Usha, and they said:
If she gives a plausible reason for her words she is believed.
Shmuel asked Rav: 
If [a woman] says,
“I am unclean,”and then she says,
“I am clean,” what is [the law]?  
He answered him: 
Also in this case if she gives a plausible reason for her words she is believed.

Daf 22b

Also in this case if she gives a plausible reason for her words she is believed.
He learned it from him forty times, and still Shmuel did not act accordingly with regard to himself.
Our Rabbis taught:
Two [witnesses] say [that the husband of the woman]
has died, and two [witnesses] say [that]
he has not died, or two [witnesses] say
[that] she has been divorced, and two [witnesses] say [that]
she has not been divorced, she shall not marry [again],ut if she has married [again], she need not go out.
R. Menahem b. Yose says:
She must go out.
Menahem b. Yose said:
When do I say [that] she must go out [of the second marriage]? — When witnesses came and then she married, but if she married and then witnesses came, she need not go out.
Now, they are two and two, [and] he who has intercourse with her should be liable to bring a doubtful guilt-offering! 
Sheshet said:
For instance, when she was married to one of her witnesses.
She herself should bring a doubtful guilt offering!
When she says,
“I am sure.”
Yohanan said:
Two [witnesses] say [that the husband]
has died, and two [witnesses] say 
he has not died, she shall not remarry, but if she has remarried, she need not go out [of the second marriage].
two [witnesses] say [that] 
she has been divorced, and two [witnesses] say [that] 
she has not been divorced, she shall not remarry and if she has married, she must go out.
What is the difference between the first case and the second case?
Abaye said
Interpret it [that it speaks] of one witness.
One witness says [that]
he has died, the rabbis believe him as two [witnesses], and [this is] according to Ulla,
for Ulla said:
Wherever the Torah believes one witness, [it is as if] there are two, 
whereas he who said that he has not died is one, and the words of one have no strength against the [words of] two.
If so, [she should be allowed to marry again] ab initio!
Because of R. Assi,
for R. Assi said
“Turn away from yourself a twisted mouth, and keep away from perverse lips” (Proverbs 4:24).
In the second case [however] one witness says [that] she has been divorced, and one witness says [that] she has not been divorced, they [therefore] both testify that she was a married woman, and he who says [that] she has been divorced is one, and the words of one have no validity against two.
Rava said:
Indeed, they are two and two, and R. Yohanan agreed with the words of R. Menahem b. Yose in [the case of] divorce, but not in [the case of] death.
Why?
In the case of death, she cannot contradict him, [but] in the case of divorce, she can contradict him.
But would she really have so much chutzpah?  
Did not R. Hamnuna say: 
f a woman says to her husband, “You have divorced me,” she is believed, for it is a presumption [that] a woman would not be so bold before her husband?
This is the case only when there are no witnesses who support her; but when there are witnesses who support her, she is indeed bold.
Assi says:
This is a case where the witnesses say,
He has died now,” [or] “He has divorced her now.”
Death one cannot prove, divorce one can prove, 
for we say to her,
If it is so, show us your get.”
Our rabbis taught: 
Two [witnesses] say that
he has been betrothed, and two [witnesses] say [that] 
she has not been betrothed, she may not marry, and if she has married, she need not go out.
Two [witnesses] say [that] 
she has been divorced, and two [witnesses] say [that] 
she has not been divorced, she may not marry, and if she has married, she must go out.

Daf 23a

What is the difference between the first case and the second case?
Abaye said: 
Interpret it [as referring] to one witness. 
One witness says [that] she has been betrothed and one witness says [that] she has not been betrothed, they both testify to an unmarried woman, and he who says [that] she has been betrothed is one, and the words of one have no validity against two.
In the second case, one witness says [that] she has been divorced and one witness says [that] she has not been divorced, they both testify to a married woman, and he who says that she has been divorced is one, and the words of one have no validity against two.
Ashi said:
Indeed, they are two and two, and reverse it. Two say, “We have seen that she has been betrothed,” and two say, “We have not seen that she has been betrothed,” she shall not marry [another man], and if she has married she must go out.
[But] this is obvious!
“We have not seen” is no evidence!
It is necessary for the case when they dwelt in one courtyard;
one might say,
“If she had been betrothed it would have been known,”
therefore it teaches us there are people who get betrothed in private.
In the second case, when two say, “We have seen that she has been divorced,” and two say, “We have not seen that she has been divorced,” she shall not marry again, and if she has married she need not go out.”
What does it teach us?  Although they live in the same courtyard!
[But then] this teaches the same thing as the first case!
What might you have said?
That with regard to betrothal it happens that people get betrothed quietly, but with regard to divorce, if she had been divorced, it would have been known, so it teaches us that there are people who get betrothed and get divorced in private.
And if witnesses come after she got married she need not go out [of the marriage].
Oshaia teaches it in reference to the first clause. Rabbah b. Avin teaches it in reference to the second clause.
He who teaches it in reference to the first clause, how much more [does he refer it] to the second clause, for in the case of a captive woman they ruled leniently.  
But he who teaches it in reference to the second clause does not refer it to the first clause.
Shall we say that they disagree concerning the view of R. Hamnuna: that he who teaches it in reference to the first clause holds the view of R. Hamnuna, and he who teaches it in reference [only] to the second clause does not hold the View of R. Hamnuna?
No, they all hold the view of R. Hamnuna
and here they differ in this.
One reasons:
when R. Hamnuna’s statement was made, it referred to a case [where she said so] in his presence, but in his absence she is bold [enough to lie], and one reasons [that]
even in his absence she is not bold.
And if witnesses came after she got married etc.
Avuha DeShmuel said:
“She got married,” does not mean she actually got married. Rather as soon as they allowed her to get married even if she did not get married yet.
But it says: “She shall not go out”! 
[This means] she shall not go out from her first permission.
Our rabbis taught: 
If she says, “I was taken captive and I am pure, and I have witnesses that I am pure”
they do not say
“Let’s wait until the witnesses come,” Rather they allow her at once [to marry].
If they allowed her to marry and then the witnesses came and said, “We do not know,” then she need not go out [of the marriage].
But if witnesses of defilement came, even if she has many children she must go out.
Certain women captives once came to Nehardea.
Avuha DeShmuel placed watchmen over them. 
Shmuel said to him:
And who watched them till now? 
He said back to him:
If they had been you daughters would you have treated them so cheaply?
It was, “As an error which proceeds from before the ruler” (Ecclesiastes 10:5) and the daughters of Mar Samuel were taken captive. And they were brought to the Land of Israel.
They had their captors stand outside and they went in into the school of R. Hanina.
This one said,
“I was taken captive and I am pure,” and that one said.
“I was taken captive and I am pure,” 
and they allowed them [to marry a priest].
In the end the captors entered.
R. Hanina said:
They are the children of a teacher [of Torah].
It [then] became known that they were the daughters of Mar Shmuel.
R. Hanina said to R. Shaman b. Abba: 
Go and take care of your relatives.
He said to R. Hanina:
But there are witnesses in the country beyond the sea!
Now, however they are not before us. Witnesses are in the north, and [therefore] she shall be forbidden [to marry]?
[Now] the reason is because no witnesses came, but if witnesses came she is forbidden!
But did not Avuha DeShmuel say: 
As soon as they allowed her to get married, even if she did not get married?  
Ashi said: 
Witnesses of defilement were referred to here.

Daf 23b

Two women were taken captive: one says, 
“I was taken captive and I am pure”, and the other one says, 
“I was taken captive and I am pure”– they are not believed.
But when they testify regarding one another, they are believed. 
GEMARA. Our Rabbis taught:
[If she says], “I am impure and my friend is pure,” she is believed; “I am pure and my friend is impure,” she is not believed; “I and my friend are impure,” she is believed as to herself and she is not believed as to her friend; 
“I and my friend are pure,” she is believed as to her friend and she is not believed as to herself.
The Master said:
“[If she says] “I am pure and my friend is impure” she is not believed.
What was the actual case?
If there are no witnesses, why is she not believed as to herself? She says,
“I was taken captive and I am pure!”
Hence it is obvious that there are witnesses. 
[Now] say the middle clause:
“I and my friend are impure”; she is believed as to herself and she is not believed as to her friend.”
But if there are witnesses, why is she not believed? 
Hence it is obvious that there are no witnesses.
[Now] read the last clause:
I and my friend are pure,” she is believed as to her friend and she is not believed as to herself.”
But if there are no witnesses, why is she not believed as to herself?
Rather it is obvious that there are witnesses.
The first clause and the last clause refer to a case when there are witnesses, [and] the middle clause when there are no witnesses?
Abaye said: 
Yes, the first clause and the last clause refer to a case when there are witnesses, [and] the middle clause when there are no witnesses?
Papa said:
All of it refers to where there are witnesses, but there is one witness who states the opposite.
[If] she says, “I am impure and my friend is pure,” and the one witness says to her, “You are pure and your friend is impure,”
she has declared herself forbidden, [and] her friend becomes permitted through her testimony.
If [she says], “I am pure and my friend is impure,” and the one witness says to her, 
“You are impure and your friend is pure’, since there are witnesses, she is not believed [as to herself], [and] her friend becomes permitted through the testimony of the [one] witness.
[If she says], “I and my friend are impure” and the one witness says to her, “You and your friend are pure,” she has declared herself forbidden, [and] her friend becomes permitted through the testimony of the [one] witness.
Why do I need this again? 
It is the same 
as the first clause!
You might have said [that] they are both pure and the reason she says so is “Let me die with the Philistines,” so he teaches us [that this is not s
[If she says] “I and my friend are pure,” and the one witness says to her, “You and your friend are impure,” since there are witnesses, she is not believed, [and] her friend becomes permitted through her testimony.  
What need is there again for this? 
It is the same as in the very first clause! 
What might you have said?
She is believed only when she declares herself unfit, but when she declares herself fit I might say that she is not believed, so he teaches us [that this is not so].
And likewise two men, [if] one says, “I am a priest”, and the other says, “I am a priest”, they are not believed. But when they testify about one another, they are believed.
Rabbi Judah says: 
one does not raise [a person] to the priesthood through the testimony of one witness.
Rabbi Elazar says:
When is this true? When there are people who object;
but when there are no people who object, one raises [a person] to the priesthood through the testimony of one witness.
Rabbi Shimon ben Gamaliel says in the name of Rabbi Shimon the son of the assistant chief of priests:
one raises [a person] to the priesthood through the testimony of one witness.
GEMARA. Why do I need all of these [cases]?
They are needed.
For if he had stated [only the case of] “R. Joshua admits”: [I might have said that only in that case is that principle invoked] because there is a possible loss of money but [in the case of] witnesses where there is no possible loss of money, I would not say so.
And if he had stated [the case of] witnesses, for [their statement concerns] other people but where it concerns himself I would not say so.

Daf 24a

I would not say so.
And if he would let us hear these two [cases I might have said] because [both cases deal with] money matters but [in the case of] “a married woman” which is a matter of [sexual] prohibition I would say no.
Why do I need [the case of] “I was taken captive and I am pure”?  
Because he wants to teach, “But if witnesses came after she got married, she shall not go out.”
This goes well according to him who teaches this in reference to the second clause, but according to him who teaches it in reference to the first clause, what is there to say?
Because he wants to teach [the case of], “If two women were taken captive.”
And why do I need [the case of] “If two women were taken captive”?
What might you have said?
Let us be concerned lest they collude, therefore he teaches us [that we are not concerned].
And also why do I need the case of “and also two men”? 
Because he wants to teach the dispute between R. Judah and the rabbis.
Our rabbis taught:
[One who says:] I am a priest and my friend is a priest, he is believed in order that others may allow him to eat terumah, but he is not believed that he would be allowed to marry a woman until there are three, [and] two testify to one and two testify to the other.
R. Judah says:
He is not believed even with regard to allowing him to eat terumah until there are three, [and] two testify to one and two testify to the other.
That is to say that R. Judah is concerned about collusion,  and the rabbis are not concerned about collusion?
But we have heard the opposite, as it is taught: 
Donkey-drivers who come to a town and one of them says,
“Mine is new and my friend’s is old” [or] “Mine has not had tithes removed and my friends has tithes removed”; he is not believed. R. Judah says: He is believed!
Ada b. Ahava, in the name of Rav: 
The statement must be reversed.
Abaye said: 
Indeed, do not reverse it; 
they were lenient with regard to demai, for most ammei haaretz separate tithes.
Rava said: 
Is the question [only] of R. Judah against R. Judah? Are the rabbis against the rabbis not a difficulty? 
Rather, R. Judah against R. Judah is not a difficulty 
as we have [just] explained, [and] the rabbis against the rabbis is not a difficulty for it is as R. Hama b. Ukba said that [it speaks of]
when he has his trade-tools in his hand;  

Daf 24b

so too here it refers to a case when he  has his trade-tools in his hand
And in what context was that of R. Hama. b. Ukba said? 
On this which we have learned: If a potter left his pots  and went down to drink [water from the river,]  the inner ones are pure and the outer ones are impure. 
But it has been taught
that these and those are impure?
Hama b. Ukba said:
[It refers to a case] when he had his trade-tools in his hand, so that everyone’s hand touches them.
But [then] the case that we have learned, “The inner ones are pure and the outer ones are impure,” where would it be found? 
These and those are pure?
Hama b. Ukba said: 
When his trade-tools are not in his hand.
But [then] the case that we have learned, 
“The inner ones are pure and the outer ones are impure,”  
where would it be found?
When they are near the public road and [they are impure] because of border stones of the public road.
When they are near the public road and [they are impure] because of border stones of the public road.
R. Judah and the rabbis differ as to whether one raises [a person] from terumah to the status of a kohen.
It was asked of them:
Does one raise [a person] from documents to [the full status of a priest] with regard to lineage? 
What is this case?
If we say that it is written in it: “I, So-and-so, a priest have signed as witness,” who has testified about him?
Rather, it is necessary when it is written in it: “I, So-and-so, a priest, have borrowed a maneh from so-and-so,” and witnesses have signed [the document]. What [then] is [the law]? 
Do they testify [only] to the maneh [mentioned] in the document, or do they testify to the whole matter? 
Huna and R. Hisda
One says:
They raise [him] and one says:
They do not raise [him].
It was asked of them: 
Do they raise [a person] from the lifting up of the hands to the status of a priest with regard to lineage?
Ask this according to him who says [that] they raise [a person] from terumah to the status of a priest and ask it according to him who says [that] they do not raise [a person from terumah to the status of a priest].  
Ask it according to him who says [that] they raise: 
This is said in the case of terumah, which [if eaten by one who is not a kohen] is punishable with death; 
but [in the case of] “lifting up the hands,” which is only the prohibition of a positive commandment, [I would say] no.  Or perhaps there is no difference.
And ask it according to him who says [that] they do not raise [from eating terumah to being a priest]:
This is in the case of terumah, which is eaten in privacy; but “lifting up the hands,” which [is done] in public [I might say that] if he were not a priest he would not have the chutzpah [to do so]. Or perhaps there is no difference?
Hisda and Rabbi Avina: 
One says they raise,
and one says
they do not raise.
Nahman b. Yitzhak said to Rava:
Do they raise [a person] from “lifting up the hands” to the full status of a priest for matters of lineage?
He said to him:
This is a dispute between R. Hisda and R. Avina.
What is the halakhah?
He said to him:
I know a baraita: 
For it has been taught:R. Yose said:
Great is presumption, for it is said: “And of the children of the priests: the children of Havayah, the children of Hakkoz, the children of Barzillai, who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their name. 
These sought their register of those that were reckoned by genealogy, and they were not found, therefore were they deemed polluted and sent away from the priesthood.
And the Tirshatha said to them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and Tummim” (Ezra 2:61-63).  
He said to them:
You remain in your presumptive state; what have you eaten in exile? The holy things eaten outside of Jerusalem. So too here also [you may eat] the holy things eaten outside of Jerusalem.
Now if we were to assume [that] one raises [a person] from “lifting up the hands” to the state of full priesthood, since these spread out their hands, they might come to raise them?
It is different here, for their presumption has been damaged. 
For if you do not say so [then] according to him who says [that] they raise [a person] from terumah to being a priest, since they eat terumah they might come raise them!
Rather it is because their presumption has been damaged.

Daf 25a

If so, what is so great about presumption?
Until now they ate [only] rabbinical terumah [and] now they ate toraitic terumah.
And if you wish you may say:
Now also they ate [only] rabbinic terumah [and] did not eat toraitic terumah,
and when they raise [a person] from terumah to the status of a priest, it is only in the case of toraitic terumah, but in the case of rabbinic terumah they do not raise.
If so, what [is the meaning of the words] “Great is presumption?”
Although one might have forbidden them [from eating rabbinic terumah] because of toraitic terumah, they did not forbid them.
But did they not eat toraitic terumah?
Surely it is written: “That they should not eat of the most holy things” (Ezra 2:63) of “the most holy things” they did not eat, but toraitic terumah they did eat!
Rather this is what he says:
They did not [eat] anything that is called a “holy thing” as it is written: “And no stranger shall eat of the holy thing” (Leviticus 22:10), nor anything which is called “holy thing” for it is written: “And if a priest’s daughter be married to a stranger she shall not eat of that which is separated from the holy things” (Leviticus 22:12) and 
a Master said:
That which has been set aside from the holy things she shall not eat.
Come and hear:
A presumption for the priesthood: The “lifting up of the hands” in Babylonia, and the eating of the hallah in Syria, and taking a share in [the priestly] gifts in large cities.
In any case he teaches the “lifting up of the hands,” is it not with regard to the full status of the priest? 
No, with regard to terumah.
But he teaches it as similar to the eating of hallah, just as the eating of hallah [is sufficient to prove that he has] the full status of a priest, so does the lifting up of the hands [prove that he has] the full status of a priest?
No the eating of the hallah itself merely [serves as evidence] regarding terumah,
[for] he holds that
hallah in our days is of rabbinical status and terumah is Biblical and one raises [a person] from rabbinic hallah to Biblical terumah
and [it is] as R. Huna the son of R. Joshua reversed [the words of] the rabbis.
Come and hear:
[The following constitutes a] presumption for the priesthood: the lifting up of the hands and [taking a share] at the distribution at the threshing floors in the Land of Israel;  in Syria and in all places to which the messengers of the New Moon come the lifting up of the hands is evidence, but not [taking a share] at the distribution at the threshing floors.
Babylonia is like Syria. R. Shimon b. Gamaliel says: 
Also Alexandria in Egypt in earlier times because there was there a permanent court of law. 
In any case he teaches the lifting up of the hands. Is this not with regard to the full status of the priest?
No, with regard to hallah. 
But he teaches [the rule regarding the lifting up of the hands] as similar to taking a share at the threshing floors: just as taking a share at the threshing floors [serves as evidence] in respect of the full status of a priest, so does the lifting up of the hands [serve as evidence] in respect of the full status of a priest!
No, taking a share at the threshing floor itself [serves as evidence only as] to hallah, 
for he holds that 
terumah in our days is rabbinical and hallah is biblical and one raises [a person] from rabbinical terumah to biblical hallah.
As the rabbis found by R. Huna the son of R. Joshua. 
For R. Huna the son of R. Joshua said:
 I found the rabbis in the Bet Rav sitting and saying: 
Even according to him who says that terumah in these days is rabbinical, hallah is biblical, for during the seven [years] that they conquered [the Land] and during the seven [years] that they distributed [it] they were obligated in hallah and not obligated in terumah.
Even according to him who says that terumah in these days is rabbinical, hallah is biblical, for during the seven [years] that they conquered [the Land] and during the seven [years] that they distributed [it] they were obligated in hallah and not obligated in terumah.
On the contrary, even according to him who says [that] terumah in these days is biblical, hallah is rabbinical,
for it has been taught: [It is written:] “In your coming into the land:” If “in your coming” you might think as soon as two or three spies had entered it? [Therefore] it is said “in your coming” (Numbers 15:18). I have spoken of the coming of all of you and not of the coming of a portion of you.
Now when Ezra brought them up

Daf 25b

not all of them went up.
Come and hear:
A presumption for the priesthood [is constituted by] the “lifting up of the hands” and taking a share at the threshing floors and testimony. 
Now is testimony a presumption? 
Rather this is what he means:
 The “lifting up of the hands is like a testimony:” Just as testimony [raises one] to the status of a priest, so too the “lifting up of the hands’ [raises one] to the status of a priest!
No. Testimony that comes on the strength of a presumption is like a presumption.
Like that man who came before R. Ammi [and] said to him: 
I am convinced that he is a priest. 
He said to him: 
What have you seen? 
And he answered him: 
He read first in the synagogue.
 [He responded] As a priest or as a great man?
After him a Levite read.
And R. Ammi raised him to the priesthood on the strength of his testimony.
Someone came before R. Joshua b. Levi, [and] said to him:
I am convinced that he is a Levite.
He said to him:
 What have you seen?
He answered him:
He read second in the Synagogue. 
As a Levite or as a prominent man?
A priest read before him. 
And R. Joshua b. Levi raised him to the status of Levite on the strength of his testimony.
Someone once came before Resh Lakish [and] said to him: 
I am convinced that he is a priest. 
He said to him:
What have you seen? 
[He answered him:]
 He asked him:
He read first in the Synagogue. 
Have you seen him take a share at the threshing floors?
 R. Elazar said to him: 
And if there is no threshing floor, is the priesthood annulled?
Once they were sitting before R. Yohanan [and] there came such a case before them.
Resh Lakish asked him:
Have you seen him take a share at the threshing floor? 
R. Yohanan said to him: 
And if there is no threshing floor, is the priesthood annulled?
He turned round and looked at R. Elazar with displeasure. He said:
You have heard something from the smith’s son and you did not say it to us in his name.
Rabbi and R. Hiyya: one raised a son to the priesthood on the testimony of his father, and one raised a brother to the state of Levite on the testimony of his brother.
Conclude that it was Rabbi who raised the son to the priesthood on the testimony of his father, for it has been taught:
If one comes and says: “This is my son and he is a priest,” he is believed with regard to allowing him to eat terumah, but he is not believed with regard to allowing him to marry a woman, the words of Rabbi.
R. Hiyya said to him:
If you believe him to allow him to eat terumah, believe him to allow him to marry a woman, and if you do not believe him so as to allow him to marry a woman, do not believe him also as to allow him to eat terumah. 
He answered him:
I believed him to allow him to eat terumah because it is in his hands to let him eat terumah, but I do not believe him so as to allow him to marry a woman because it is not in his hands to let him marry a woman. 
 Conclude [that this opinion belongs to Rabbi].
And since it was Rabbi who raised the son to the priesthood on the testimony of his father, [it must have been] R. Hiyya who raised the brother to the status of Levite on the testimony of his brother.
But [according to] R. Hiyya, why is the son different that [he is] not [raised]? Because he is related to his father. A brother too is related to his brother! 

Daf 26a

When he was innocently talking. 
As that which Rav Judah said in the name of Shmuel:
 It happened that a man was talking innocently and said: 
“I remember when I was a child and riding on my father’s shoulder, they took me out from school and stripped me of my shirt and immersed me  so that I could eat terumah in the evening.”
And R. Hiyya added: 
And my friends kept away from me 
and called me ‘Yohanan the hallot-eater.” And Rabbi raised him to the priesthood on his testimony.
It was taught R. Shimon b. Elazar says:
Just as terumah is a presumption for the priesthood, so is the first tithe a presumption for the priesthood, but he who takes a share through the court, [this] is not a presumption.
The first tithe belongs to the Levite?!
[This] follows R. Elazar ben Azariah,
for it has been taught:
Terumah belongs to the priest, the first tithe to the Levite, the words of R. Akiva.
Elazar ben Azariah says: 
The first tithe belongs also to the priest.
Say that R. Elazar ben Azariah says: “Also to the priest” does he say: to the priest and not to the Levite?
Yes. after Ezra had punished them.
But perhaps it happened that they gave it to him?
Hisda said: 
What are we dealing with here? A case where we know that his father was a priest and a rumor came out concerning him that he was the son of a divorced woman or a halutzah and [yet] they gave him tithe at the threshing floor.
[He could not be regarded as] a Levite, because he was not a Levite. What then could you say? That he was the son of a divorced woman or the son of a halutzah? Even so there is no question, for according to the one who says [that] the first tithe is forbidden to strangers they would not have given [it] to him. And even according to the one who says that the first tithe is permitted to strangers, this refers only to give to them but as part of the distribution, they would not give it to him.
But he who takes a share through the court, [this] is not a presumption.
If through the court it is not a presumption, what is presumption?
Sheshet said: This is what he means: 
One who shares with his brother’s at the court terumah that was part of his father’s property, it is not a presumption.
This is obvious!
What might you have said?
Since these [get their share of terumah] in order to eat it, so too this one also [gets his share of terumah] in order to eat it. So he teaches us [that]
those [get the terumah] for eating and this one for selling. 
Judah says: 
One does not raise [a person] to the priesthood on the testimony of one witness, etc… [ Rabbi Shimon ben Gamaliel says in the name of Rabbi Shimon the son of the assistant chief of priests: [a person] to the priesthood through the testimony of one witness.]
Shimon b. Gamaliel is the same as R. Eliezer?
 And if you will say [that]
they differ with regard to an objection raised by one person [in] that...
R. Eliezer holds that an objection
[can be accepted from] one [person] and R. Shimon b. Gamaliel holds that
 an objection [must come from at least] two [people], 
did not R. Yohanan say:
All agree that an objection [must come from] at least two persons?
Rather here we are dealing with a case where we have a presumption that the father of this [person] is a priest and a rumor came out concerning him that he is the son of a divorced woman or the son of a halutzah and they demoted him from the priesthood, and one witness came and said,
“I know that he is a priest” and they raised him [again]

Daf 26b

and they raised him [again]
and [then] came two [other witnesses]
and said [that] he is the son of a divorced woman or the son of a halutzah and they demoted him [again]
and [then] one witness came and said,
“I know that he is a priest.
All agree that the [two witnesses] are joined into one testimony, but they differ as to whether we are afraid of disgracing the court.
The first Tanna holds: 
Since we demoted him we do not raise him, [again] because we are afraid of disgracing the court. 
And R. Shimon b. Gamaliel holds: 
We have demoted him and we can raise him and we are not concerned of bringing disgrace on the court.
Ashi asked against this: 
If so, even [when there are] two and two also?
Rather R. Ashi said 
they differ as to whether they are joined into one testimony. And they are arguing about the same issue as the following tannaim, 
for it has been taught:
Their testimonies are not joined together unless they have both seen [the event] at the same time. Joshua b. Korha says: 
Even when [they have seen] one after another.
And their testimonies cannot be upheld in court until they both testify at the same time Natan says: 
 We hear the evidence of one today and when the other one comes tomorrow we hear his evidence.
A woman was imprisoned by non-Jews: If for the sake of money, she is permitted to her husband, And if in order to take her life, she is forbidden to her husband..
GEMARA. R. Shmuel b. Yitzchak said in the name of Rav: 
They have taught [this] only when the hand of Israel is strong over the non-Jews but when the hand of the non-Jews is strong over themselves, even if for the sake of money, she is forbidden to her husband.
Rava objected:
R. Yose the priest and R. Zechariah b. HaKatzav testified regarding an Israelite woman, who had been taken as collateral in Ashkelon and her family distanced her and her witnesses testified that she had not been secluded [with a man] and that she was not defiled [by a man].
And the Sages said to them:
If you believe [the witnesses] that she had been taken as collateral, believe [them also] that she was not secluded and that she was not defiled, and if you do not believe [them] that she was not secluded and that she was not defiled, do not believe [them] that she was pledged.
Now Ashkelon [was a town in which] the hand of the non-Jews was strong over themselves

Daf 27a

and he teaches when she was taken as collateral” but not “when she was imprisoned”?
[No] the same applies also to [the case if] she had been imprisoned, and the case just happened this way.
There are those who say: Rav said:
We have also learned this [in a Mishnah]:
R. Yose the priest and R. Zechariah b. HaKatzav testified regarding an Israelite woman, who had been taken as collateral in Ashkelon and her family distanced her and her witnesses testified that she had not been secluded [with a man] and that she was not defiled [by a man].
And the Sages said to them:
If you believe [the witnesses] that she had been taken as collateral, believe [them also] that she was not secluded and that she was not defiled, and if you do not believe [them] that she was not secluded and that she was not defiled, do not believe [them] that she was pledged.
Now Ashkelon where [it happened] for the sake of money, and [yet] the reason [why she was permitted her to her husband was] because witnesses testified concerning her, but if witnesses did not testify concerning her [she would] not [have been permitted]; and is it not [also to be supposed] that there is no difference whether she was pledged or imprisoned?
No, when she was pledged it is different.
Some put in the form of a contradiction. We have learned:
if for the sake of money she is permitted to her husband.
But they raise a contradiction: 
R. Yose testified etc. [Now] in Ashkelon [it happened] for the sake of money and [yet] the reason [why she is permitted to her husband] is because witnesses testify concerning her, but if no witnesses testify concerning her, [she would] not [have been permitted].
And they resolve:
R. Shmuel b. Yitzhak said:
It is no contradiction; here  [it speaks] when the hand of Israel is strong over the non-Jews, [and] there when the hand of the non-Jews is strong over themselves.
If for the purpose of [taking her] life she is forbidden [to her husband].
Rav said:
As for instance the wives of thieves.
Levi said:
As for instance, the wife of Ben Dunai.
 Hezekiah said: 
This is only when they have [already] been sentenced to death.
Yohanan says:
Even if they have not yet been sentenced to death.
