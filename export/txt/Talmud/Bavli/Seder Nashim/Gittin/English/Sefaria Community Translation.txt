Daf 9a





















Should a messenger bring a Get from a place beyond sea, and is not able to testify that it was written and signed in his presence, its validity must be proved by the signatures of the attesting witnesses.
Both Gittin of women and deeds of manumission for slaves, are alike in respect to the person who brings them from, or carries them to [a distant country], and this is one of the points in which the laws respecting Gittin and deeds of manumission are alike.

Daf 9b



Daf 10a







All legal documents, on which the attestation of a Samaritan witness appears, are void, Gittin and deeds of manumission excepted.
It once happened that a Get was brought to Rabbon Gamaliel in the village Otnay, which was attested by Samaritans, which he nevertheless declared to be a valid instrument.

Daf 10b
























All legal documents made in courts of justice of non-Israelites are valid, even when the attesting witnesses are not Israelites, Gittin and deeds of manumission excepted.
R. Simeon declares
these also to be valid, the contrary was only mentioned to apply to the case when they were prepared in an extra judicial manner.

Daf 11a



Daf 11b










 When a person says,
"Give this Get to my wife, or this deed of manumission to my slave," he can, if he repents of his purpose, take it back. Such is the dictum of R. Meir,
but the sages hold
"That this is only allowable with a Get, and not with a deed of manumission, because it is permitted to confer advantages on a person in his absence, but not to deprive him of any advantage, except in his presence;
for, if a person refuses to maintain his slave, he may do so, but he may not refuse maintenance to his wife."
He [R. Meir] thus argued to them:
"Does he not surely disqualify both his slave and wife from the right of eating heave?"
But they [the sages] replied,
"It is because the slave is the priest's property [and is considered in the same light as his cattle, that he has a right to eat of the heave.]"

Daf 12a



Daf 12b



Daf 13a











Should a person say, "Give this Get to my wife, and this deed of manumission to my slave," and dies [before it was delivered], they may not be delivered to the parties mentioned after his decease;
but if he said, "You are to give a maneh to A.B.," and dies, that money must be paid [to the legatee].

Daf 14b



Daf 15a




























When a person who brings a Get from a foreign country declares, "It was written, but not signed in my presence," or the reverse, or, "The whole [Get] was written, but only in part attested in my presence," or, "Only half of the writing [of the Get] but the whole of the signatures were written in my presence," it is void.
Also in case one [witness] says, "It was written," and another, "It was signed in my presence."
When two say, "It was written in our presence," and one, "It was signed in my presence," it is also void. But R. Jehudah declares it valid.
When one declares, "It was written in my presence," and two declare "It was signed in our presence," it is valid.

Daf 15b



Daf 16a



Daf 16b



Daf 17a


































If it were both written and signed in the day time, or that both writing and signatures were done at night, or that it was written at night, but signed by day, it is valid.
If it were written by day, but signed at night, it is void,
but R. Simeon declares it valid; for he established it as a rule
"That all documents written by day and signed at night are void, except letters of divorce."

Daf 17b



Daf 18a



Daf 18b



Daf 19a








The writing of a Get may be done with any material,
with ink, paint, ruddle, gum, or with vitriol black, and with every other indelible material,
but not with any liquor, the juice of fruit, nor with any delible material.
It may be written on any thing, even on a leaf of an olive tree or on a cow's horn. In the latter case, however, the husband is bound to give her [the wife] the cow along with it. He may write it on the hand of a slave, but then he must give her the slave also;
but R. José
prohibits the writing of a Get on any thing endowed with life, or on edible articles.

Daf 19b



Daf 20a



Daf 20b



Daf 21a



Daf 21b




























A Get may not be written on any thing that is yet attached or fixed to the soil.
If it was so written, and it was afterwards severed from the soil, and then signed and delivered to the woman, it is valid.
But R. Jehudah declares it void, for it must be written and signed on what is detached from the soil.
R. Jehudah ben Beterah saith,
"It must not be written on papyrus, on which an erasure or abrasion appears, nor on unfinished vellum, because it affords opportunity for falsification;" but the sages permit it.

Daf 22a



Daf 22b















All are qualified to write a Get, even deaf and dumb, or foolish persons and minors.
A woman may write her own Get, and the husband his acquittance [for the amount of the Ketubah he has paid her], because the validity of legal documents depends solely on the signature of the attesting witnesses.

Daf 23a













































All are qualified [to act as missionaries or agents] to bring over a Get, except deaf and dumb or foolish persons, minors, a blind person, and a non-Israelite.
When a minor received [a commission to deliver] a Get and became of age [before he delivered it], or a deaf person whilst in that state, and who afterwards recovered his hearing, or a blind person who subsequently recovered his sight, or a demented person, who was afterwards cured, or a non-Israelite, who subsequently became a proselyte, the Get is void.
But when a person received it whilst in possession of his faculty of hearing, and before he delivered he became deaf, and again recovered his hearing, or a person who could see, had become blind, and again recovered his sight, or a person of sound mind who had become demented, and was cured: the Get is valid,
because the rule is,
that when the commencement and end of the act took place, whilst the person was in possession of his faculties, it is valid.

Daf 23b

































Those females who are not considered competent witnesses to testify to a woman in respect to the decease of her husband, are to be credited when [as messengers] they bring over a Get to her,
viz., her mother-in-law, the daughter of her mother-in-law, her rival, the wife of her husband's brother, and her husband's daughter.
Why is this difference in respect to the evidence as to a Get, or as to the death of a husband?
Because there is [in the first mentioned case] a document in existence to confirm the evidence.
A woman may bring her own Get with her, but she must declare at the same time, "It was written and signed in my presence."

Daf 90a














































It was taught [in a baraita]: Rabbi Meir says:
Just as there are different attitudes in consumption of food, so are there different attitudes with regards to women.
Some men, if a fly falls into his cup, he throws it out and does not drink it. And this is the trait of Papus ben Yehuda, who would lock [the door of the house] before his wife, and would leave.
And there is a man where, if a fly falls in his cup, he throws [the fly] out and then drinks it. This is the trait of any man who lets her be to speak with her brothers and relatives.
And there is a man where, if a fly falls into the plate, he crushes it and eats it. And this is the trait of a corrupted man who sees his wife go out with her head uncovered and spins cloth in the marketplace,

Daf 90b

and [whose shirt is] open on both sides and bathes with the men.
Do you truly think "with the men"?
Rather, [it means] in a place where men bathe.
This is the command from the Torah to divorce her, for it is stated
[Deuteronomy 24:1-2] "[When a man takes a wife, and marries her, then it comes to pass, if she find no favor in his eyes,] because he hath found some unseemly thing in her, [that he writes her a bill of divorce, and gives it in her hand,] and sends her out of his house... [and she departs out of his house, and goes and becomes another man's wife.]" The text calls him 'another', implying that he is not of similar constitution as the first, [for] the first one sent away a wicked woman from his household, and the other took a wicked woman into his house.
