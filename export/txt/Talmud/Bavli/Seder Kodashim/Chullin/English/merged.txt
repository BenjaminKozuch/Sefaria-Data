Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a

Everyone [may] slaughter and his slaughter is valid: except  a deafmute, a simpleton or a minor, so that they will not spoil the slaughter. But [if they] all slaughter and others see them, their slaughter is valid.

Mishna: One who slaughters on Shabbat or on Yom Kippur, even though he's liable for his soul, his slaughtering is Kosher.
Gamarra: Rav Huna says that Hiiya bar Rav expounded in the name of Rav, [that this slaughtered animal] is forbidden to eat on the day. The Yeshiva Bochrim in the academy came to think that this ruling of rag reflects the view of Rabbi Yehuda. Which of Rabbi Yehuda's mishnayot? It's Rabbi Yehuda about preparation. For it was taught in a mishnah that one can chop up gourds for an animal, or a carcass for a dogs. But Rabbi Yehuda says that if it wasn't a carcass as of shabbat eve, then it's forbidden...

Mishnah: In the case where one is obligated [in tithing] in bitter almonds they are exempt from sweet ones, when they are obligated in sweet ones, they are exempt from bitter ones.
Gemarra: The rabbis taught in a beraita, Almonds that are bitter and small are obligated. Big ones are exempt. Sweet ones that are big are obligated, while the small ones are exempt. Rabbi Yishmael in the name of Rabbi Yossi says in the name of his father: Both this one and that one are exempt. And some say [that he said] both this and this are obligated. Rabbi Ilai says....
Mishnah: The grape seeds that did not ferment, are not able to be redeemed with silver of tithe money, and they invalidate a mikvah. Once it ferments, it can be redeemed on silver of tithe money and does not invalidate a mikvah. Brothers that are in a partnership, when they are obligated in the Kalbon [extra bit on the shekel] they are exempt from the first born animal tithe, when they are obligated in  the first born animal tithe, then they are obligated in Kalbon.
Germara: Who is the author of our mishnah? It is not Rabbi Yehuda, nor is it the Rabbis. For it was taught in a Beraita, one who has temed and adds water in a certain quantity, and then [when removing the temed] finds it as it's [original] volume, he is exempt [from tithing], But Rabbi Yehudah obligates him [to tithe]. Who is it [the author of our mishnah] ? If it's the Rabbis, even though it fermented [they would still exempt him], if it was Rabbi Yehudah, even though it did not ferment [he would obligate in tithing].  Rabbi Nachman says in the name of Rabba Bar Avuah.

[this demon entity] saw that they were spilling water out from the mouth of the pitcher, saying
...If I knew that you had the custom to do this, I would not have delayed
Upon Rav Dimi's coming he said;
... [failing to do] The first waters fed him pig meat, the last removed a woman from her husband
...Upon Ravin's arrival he said;
...[Failing to do] The first waters fed him neveilah meat, the last killed somebody
Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak said; and your mnemonic [is this]
Rav Dimi came [the husband] removed her; Ravin came [and] killed her
... R' Abba taught; one of these [is not] and one of these [is] reflecting the most [more] severe
...It was told [about water] heated by fire
... Chizkiyah said;
...We cannot use them to wash the hands. But R'Yochanan said:
We can use them to wash the hands
R' Yochanan said:
I asked of Rabban Gamliel the son of Rebbi, and he was the one who ate only tohoros and he said to me:
All the great of Galil do so
the Hot springs of Tiberias; Chizkiyah said
We cannot use them to wash hands, but we can immerse hands in them.
but R' Yochenan said:
One may immerse his whole body in [the springs], but not his face hands and feet.

Daf 108a




... (M') [If] A drop of milk falls on a slice of meat and imparts a flavor to it, prohibited. 
If it falls into a [meat] soup and imparts a flavor, prohibited. 
...(G') Abaye said 
... [The issue of] Taste without the object [giving off the taste] is, in general, [prohibited] by the Torah. And if you should think that it is [only prohibited] by the Rabbis [and that the reason] that we don't learn it from [the prohibition of not mixing] meat and milk is because it is a new  case. But if this is a new case then it wouldn't matter about if it imparted taste [or not].
...Rava said in response:
...[only] cooking was prohibited by the Torah. 
...Rav said:
...When the contact happens and the taste is transferred the mixture is forbidden like neveilah which can in turn render other pieces [of meat] prohibited, because they are the same type of substance.
