Daf 40b

But perhaps we should say that each case is as written,1 for if it be so,2 the Divine Law should have
stated them in a single case?3 — Since all [seven] are severally prescribed,4 [the requirements of]
each is inferred from the other,5 and that being so, it is as though all [seven] were written with
reference to each. But surely they [the cases in question] are not similar to each other!6 (Mnemonic:
Spared, Sword, Warning.) Thus: The condemned city is unlike the other two,7 for their possessions
[the condemned's, in the latter two charges,] are spared.8 Again, idolatry differs from the other two
cases, for in them [execution is] by the sword.9 Again, witnesses proved Zomemim are unlike the
other two cases, since they require a formal warning?10 — We infer it11 from the identical use of
‘diligently’12 and the gezerah-shawah13 is free,14 for otherwise, it [the deduction] could be refuted.15
And it is truly free: since Scripture could have read,16 And they shall inquire and they shall search,17
and yet changes its expression [by employing the word] ‘diligently’,18 it follows that the purpose
thereof was to leave it free.19 But it [the analogy] is free only on one side!20 [For] granted that it is
free in these two cases,21 since [another expression] could have been used:22 in the case of the
condemned city,23 what else could have been written:24 for are not all [three]25 employed?26 —
There too it [sc. ‘diligently’] is truly free, for Scripture could have read, Inquiring thou shalt
inquire,27 or searching thou shalt search;28 and varies the idiom by the use of ‘diligently’; it may
therefore be inferred that this was in order to leave it free.29
 Now,30 we infer [the same requirement for charges punishable by] strangulation a minori from
cases punishable by stoning or decapitation.31 Again, the same is deduced for cases of burning a
minori from those of stoning.32 This [however] is right on the view of the Rabbis that stoning is
severer [than burning]. But what is to be said on the view of R. Simeon that burning is the severer?33
— Rab Judah therefore said: [Scripture states,] Behold if it be truth and the thing certain,34 [and
again] Behold if it be truth and the thing certain:35 this gives eleven [expressions implying
inquiry].36 Seven [are employed] to indicate the seven queries: then subtracting the three needed for
the gezerah shawah,37 one still remains, whose purpose according to R. Simeon, is to include the
cases of burning,38 whereas according to the Rabbis,39 [the necessary explanation is that] Scripture
[sometimes] takes the trouble of stating a fact which can be deduced a minori. R. Abbahu ridiculed
this [explanation]: Perhaps it [the eleventh expression] indicates an eighth query!40 But are eight
queries [hakiroth] conceivable?41 Why not? Surely, What part of the hour, may be added [as the
eighth question]! And indeed, it has been taught even so: ‘They examined him with eight queries.’
Now, that is correct42 according to Abaye on R. Meir's ruling, viz., A man is [to be treated as] not
liable to make even the slightest error.43 And even according to the version which states, A man is
liable to make a slight error: it is also right.44 But according to Abaye on R. Judah's ruling, viz., A
man is liable to err to the extent of half an hour, and according to Raba, who said, People are liable
to err to even a greater extent, what can you say? — Well then, [the eleventh expression] may be
intended to add, ‘Which year of the Jubilee’ as a query. But that is identical with: ‘In what
septennate?’! — Rather this is the additional question: ‘In what Jubilee? And the other Tanna? —45
Since he [the witness] tells us in which septennate, it is necessary to ask: ‘In which Jubilee?’46 R.
JOSE SAID etc. it has been taught: R. Jose said to the Sages: According to your view, one who
comes and testifies, ‘He killed him last night,’ must be asked: ‘In which septennate? In what year? In
what month? On what day of the month?’ They retorted: And according to your view, one who
comes and declares, ‘He killed him just now,’ is to be asked: ‘On what day? At what hour? And
where?’ But [you too must answer that] even though the questions may be unnecessary, they are put
to them [the witnesses], in accordance with the view of R. Simeon b. Eleazar;47 so here too,48 even if
they are unnecessary, they are put to them [the witnesses], in accordance with R. Simeon b. Eleazar's
view. And R. Jose?49 — ‘He killed him last night,’ is a frequent testimony; whereas, ‘He has killed
him just now,’ is rare.50
 DID YE KNOW HIM? Our Rabbis taught: [The following questions are asked]: Do ye know him?
Did he kill a heathen? Did he kill an Israelite? Did ye warn him? Did he accept your warning?51 Did
he admit his liability to death?52 Did he commit the murder within the time needed for an
utterance?53 Where he committed idolatry, [the witness is asked:] Which [idol] did he worship? Did
he worship Peor?54 Did he worship Merkolis?55 How did he worship? By sacrifice, offering incense,
libations, or prostration? ‘Ulla said: Where is the need of warning intimated in the Torah? — In the
verse, And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or his mother's daughter, and see her
nakedness.56 Does guilt then depend upon [mere] seeing? Hence it must mean [that he is liable to
punishment] only if he ‘sees’ the reasonableness thereof.57 And since this is inapplicable to Kareth,58
