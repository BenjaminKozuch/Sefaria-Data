        "Mesechet A woman is acquired (betrothed) in three ways, and she acquires herself (regains independence) in two ways.  She is acquired with money, a document, or relations.  With money – Beit Shamay says, with a dinar or with (things which are) worth a dinar.  Beit Hillel says, with a pruta, or worth a pruta.  And how much is a pruta?  One of eight (an eighth) of an Italian issar (which makes a pruta worth 1/192 of a dinar).  And she acquires herself with a get (divorce document) or with the death of her husband.  A yevama (one whose husband died without having children, so she has a child with her husband’s brother) is acquired (by the yavam, the husband’s brother) with (only) relations.  And she acquires herself with chalitza (a process which signifies a rejection of yibum) and with the death of the yavam.An Ivri (Jewish) slave is acquired with money and with a document.  And he acquires himself with years (six years if he was sold by the court), yovel (all Ivri slaves are automatically released on the fiftieth year of the yovel cycle), or by a monetary reduction (he can pay part of what he owes to reduce his term of service).  An Ivri handmaid is greater than him in that she acquires herself with signs (of puberty, after which she goes free).  One who is pierced (in the ear to symbolize that he does not wish to leave his master after his term) is acquired by piercing.  And he (the pierced) acquires himself by yovel and the death of the master.A Cana’ani slave s acquired with money, a document, and chazaka (if he already does tasks for the owner).  And he acquires himself with money at the hands of others (others pay), and with a document on his own hands (if the master releases him) according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say, with money on his own hands, and with a document at the hands of others, as long as the money is that of others.A large animal (cattle) is acquired with mesira (handing over, for other forms such as raising are not practical), and a small one (flock) with hagba’a (raising) according to Rabi Meir and Rabi Elazar.  Chachamim say, a small animal is acquired (even) by meshicha (pulling to another place).Property which has security (referring to land for it is security on loans) is acquired with money, a document, and with chazaka (making an act of ownership).  And those which do not have security, they are not acquired except with meshicha.  Property which does not have security is acquired with property which has security (if they are acquired together, one may acquire with) money, a document, and chazaka.  And property which does not have security (make a) requirement for a swear about property which has security (we do not usually make swears about land, but if we are already swearing about non-land, we add a swear for land.All which is made the money of the other (evaluated as fit to be traded for some other thing), since he (the seller) merited this, he owes this (the object being traded for) as a chaliphin (trade).  How?  He traded an ox for a cow, or a donkey for an ox, because this one (the seller) merited, he owes this as a trade.  The higher right (treasury of the Beit Hamikdash acquires necessary objects) with money, and the layman’s right (title he has  he acquires) with chazaka.  What he says to the high (right) is like what he hands over to the layman (declaring something for the Beit Hamikdash is like handing it over).All mitzvot of the son (which deal which the son and the responsibility falls) on the father, men are chayav and women are patur.  And all mitzvot of the father on the son, whether men or women, they are chayav.  And all mizvot ase shehazman grama (positive commandments which have a set time), men are chayav and women are patur.  And all positive mitzvot which do not have defined time, whether men or women, they are chayav.  And al negative commandments, whether there is a set time or there is no set time, whether men or women they are chayav, except for, “do not destroy (the corners of your beard, which women do not do,” “you shall not round (the corners of your hair),” and, “do not become tame for the dead (for male kohanim only).”Leaning (on a korban), waving, bringing near (adding things to a mincha), taking up handfuls (of a mincha), smoking (of incense), pinching of necks (of bird offerings), sprinkling (blood), and accepting (collecting the blood of a sacrifice), are done with men and not with women, except for the mincha of a sota and a nezira, for they wave.Any mitzva which is dependant on the land, isn’t done except in the land (of Israel), and (a mitzva) which is not dependant on the land is done whether in the land or outside of the land, except from orla and kilayim (which while dependant on the land are done outside Israel).  Rabi Eliezer says, also from chadash (grain which there has not been a Pesach since its harvesting, making it assur).All who do one mitzva is rewarded and they lengthen his days (life) and he inherits the land (the World to Come).  And all who do not do one mitzva, they do not reward him, they do not lengthen his days, and he does not inherit the land.  All who have (knowledge) in the torah, the mishna, and the ways of the world (proper actions), he does not sin quickly, as it says, “and the string is tripled, it does not quickly disconnect.”  And all who are not in the torah, not mishna, and not the ways of the world, he is not one of those of the settlement (settled community, and derives no benefit from them).A man betroths by him and his messenger.  A woman is betrothed by her and her messenger.  A man betroths his daughter when she is a young girl by him or by his messenger.  One who says to a woman, become betrothed with me by this date (the fruit), be betrothed to me by this (some random object), if one of them is worth a pruta, she is betrothed, and if not, she is not betrothed.  (If he says it) with this, with this, and with this, if there is the worth of a pruta (together) in all of them, she is betrothed, and if not, she is not betrothed.  If she eats them one by one, she is not betrothed, until one of them is worth a pruta.Be betrothed to me in this cup of wine, and it was found that it was honey, of honey and it was found to be of wine; with this silver dinar, and it was found (to be of) the golden dinar, of gold and it was found of silver.  On condition that I am rich and he is found out as poor, poor and he was found to be rich, she is not betrothed.  Rabi Shimon says, mistake is not to be praised, she is married.(If one engages a woman) on condition that I (the one engaging) am a kohen, and he was found to be a levi, a levi and he was found to be a kohen, a natin and he was found to be a mamzer, a mamzer and he was found to be a natin, a city dweller and he was found to be the resident of a village, the resident of a village and he was found to be a city dweller, on condition that my house is near a bathhouse and it was found to be far, far and it was found to be near, on condition that I have a a daughter or maidservant who is a grown up and he doesn’t, I don’t have and he does, on condition that I don’t have children and he has, or that I have and he doesn’t, and in all of them even though she said, in my heart had (intention) to become engaged to him despite that (regardless of the condition he made), she is not engaged.  And so to she who deceived him (is not engaged).One who says to his messenger, go out and engage for me such-and-such a girl in such-and-such a place, and he went and engaged her in another place, she is not engaged.  (If he said,) behold she is in such-and-such a place, and he engaged her in another place, behold this one is engaged.One who engages a woman on condition that there are no vows on her, and vows were found on her, she is not engaged.  If he married her without condition and there were vows found on her, she exits (the marriage) without a ktuba.  On condition that she has no blemishes, and blemishes were found on her, she is not engaged.  If he married her without condition and blemishes were found on her, she exits without a ktuba.  All blemishes which make a kohen invalid (from service) make a woman invalid.One who engages two women with (objects of a total) value of a pruta, or one woman with less than the value of a pruta, even if he sent gifts afterwards, she is not engaged, for (only) because of the first engagement did he send (the gifts).  And so too with a minor who engaged (as a minor and then sent gifts as an adult).One who engages a woman and her daughter, or a woman and her sister together, they are not engaged.  There was a case with five women, among them two sisters, one (man) gathered a large basket of figs, it was theirs, and it was shvi’it, and he said, behold you are all engaged to me by this basket.  One of them accepted on behalf of all of them, and the Chachamim said, the sisters are not engaged.One (a kohen) who engages with his portion (of a sacrifice), whether of the most holy (korbanot) or minor holy things, she is not engaged.  With ma’aser sheni, whether by accident or intentionally, he did not engage her, according to Rabi Meir.  Rabi Yehuda says, by accident he did not engage, intentionally he engaged.  An with hekdesh, he intentionally he engaged, and accidentally he did not engage, according to Rabi Meir.  Rabi Yehuda says, accidentally he engaged, intentionally he did not engage.One who engages with orla (fruit from the first three years of a tree which is forbidden), kilay hakerem (mixed seeds from a vineyard), an ox to be stoned, an egla arufa, the birds of a metzora (which he brings at the end of his term), the hair of a nazir (which he burns at the end of his term), the redeemed of a donkey (firstborn which has been redeemed from automatic dedication to the Beit Hamikdash) meat and milk, or everyday meat slaughtered in the sanctuary, she is not engaged.  If he sold them and engaged with their money, she is engaged.One who is engaged with trumot, ma’asrot, gifts (to the poor of leket, shichicha, and pe’ah), the water of chatat (made from the ashes of a red heifer), or the ashes of a chatat (the red heifer), behold she is engaged, even a yisra’el.One who says to his friend, go and betroth me such-and-such a woman, and he went and betrothed her for himself, she is betrothed.  And so too one who says to a woman, behold you are betrothed to me after thirty days, and another one came and betrothed her within thirty days, she is betrothed to the second.  A bat yisra’el to a kohen (if he was the second), she may eat truma.  (If one betroths) from now until thirty days, and another came and betrothed her within thirty days, she is betrothed and not betrothed (it is a doubt).  A bat yisra’el to a kohen or a bat kohen to a yisra’el, she may not eat truma.One who says to a woman, behold you are betrothed to me on condition that I give you two hundred zuz, she is engaged and he will give.  On condition that I will give you (two hundred zuz) from here until thirty days, if he gave her within thirty days, she is betrothed, and if not, she is not betrothed.  On condition that I have two hundred zuz, behold she is betrothed and he has.  On condition that that I will show you two hundred zuz, behold this on is engaged and he will show her.  And if he showed her on the table (if he is a moneychanger, it is the money of others), she is not betrothed.(If one engages a woman) on condition that I have a bet kor (enough land to sow a kor, 30 se’ah, of seeds), behold this one is betrothed if this one has.  On condition that I have in such-and-such a place, if he has in that place, she is betrothed, and if not, she is not betrothed.  On condition that I will show you a beit kor of earth, behold she is betrothed if he shows.  And if he showed her in a valley (which is not his), she is not betrothed.Rabi Meir says, all conditions which aren’t like the conditions of bnei gad and bnei reuven (when they wanted to settle across the Jordan), are not conditions, as it says, “and Moshe said to them, if bnei gad and bnei reuven cross (to help conquer Israel they will get the land they want),” and it is written, “and if they do not cross armed,” (showing that a condition needs to be made with both the positive and negative actions explained)  Rabi  Chanania ben Gamliel says, he had to say this (the second condition) for without this, there was reason (to believe that the consequence for not crossing would be losing all rights to land (whereas Moshe says they get land in Israel).One who betrothed a woman and said, I thought she was a kohenet, and behold she is a levi’a, a levi’a and behold she is a kohenet, poor and behold she is rich, or rich and behold she is poor, behold she is betrothed because she did not deceive him.  One who says to a woman, behold you are betrothed to me after I convert, after you convert, after I am freed (from slavery), after you are freed, after your husband dies, after your sister dies (he was married to her sister and therefore forbidden to marry the woman), or after your yavam does chalitza for you, she is not betrothed.  And so too one who says to his friend, if your wife gives birth to a girl, behold she is betrothed to me, she is not betrothed.  If the wife of his friend was pregnant and the pregnancy was known, his words stand, and if she gives birth to a girl, she is betrothed.One who says to a woman, behold you are betrothed to me on condition that I speak on your behalf to the governor, or I do for you like a laborer (work for you).  If he spoke about her to the governor or did for her like a laborer, she is betrothed, and if not, she is not betrothed.  On condition that (my) father wants (us to be engaged), if the father wants, she’s betrothed, and if not, she is not betrothed.  If the father died, behold she is betrothed.  If the son died, they instruct the father to say that he doesn’t want.(If a man says,) I betrothed my daughter but I don’t know who I betrothed her to, and one comes and says, I betrothed her, he is believed.  If one said, I betrothed her, and one said, I betrothed her, they both give a get, but if they want, one gives a get and one marries (her).(If a man says,) I betrothed my daughter I betrothed her and divorced her while she was a minor, and behold she is a minor, he is believed.  I betrothed her and divorced her while she is a minor, and behold she is an adult, he is not believed.  She was taken captive (making her assur to a kohen) and I redeemed her, whether she was a minor or an adult, he is not believed.  One who said at the time of his death, I have sons (meaning his wife does not need yibum), he is believed.  (If a dying person said,) I have brothers (and it is clear that he had no sons, and therefore his wife needs yibum), he is not believed.  One who betroths his daughter without specifying (which daughter), the bogrot (adults) aren’t included (in the possible spouses).One who has two sets of daughters from two wives and said, I betrothed my older daughter, and I do not know if it was the older of the older (daughters, the first born), the older of the younger (third born), or the younger of the older (second), for she is older than the older of younger (third), all of them are assur (to marry unless they get a get), except for the younger of the younger (fourth), according to Rabi Meir.  Rabi Yossi says, all of them are allowed, except for the older of the older (first).  (If the man says,) I betrothed my younger daughter, and I do not know if is the younger of the younger (fourth), the younger of the older (second), or the older of the younger (third), for she is younger than the younger of the older (second), all of them are assur except the older of the older (first), according to Rabi Meir.  Rabi Yossi says, all of the are permitted except the younger of the younger (fourth).One who says to a woman, I betrothed you, and she says, you didn’t betroth me, he is assur to her relatives and she is mutar to his relatives.  If she says, you betrothed me, and he says, I didn’t betroth you, he is mutar to her relatives, but she is assur to his relatives.  (If a man says,) I betrothed you, and she says, you didn’t betroth other than my daughter, he is assur to the relatives of the older (mother) and the older is mutar to his relatives, he is mutar to the relatives of the younger (the daughter) and the younger is mutar to his relatives.Yud (If a man says,) I betrothed your daughter, and she says, you didn’t betroth other than me, he is assur to the relatives of the younger and the younger is mutar to his relatives, he is mutar to the relatives of the older, and the older is assur to his relatives.  Yud Any place there is kiddushin (betrothal) and no transgression (in the marriage), the children go after the male (the father’s lineage).  And which is it?  This is a kohenet, a levi’a, and a yisra’elit who married a kohen, to a levi, and to a yisra’el.  And every place where there is kiddushin and there is transgression (the marriage is invalid), the offspring go after the blemished (who makes the marriage invalid).  And which is it?  A widow to a kohen gadol, a divorcee or a chalutza to a lay kohen, a mamzer or netina to a yisra’el, or the bat of a yisra’el to a mamzer or natin.  And all who do not have kiddushin for him (it is invalid), but she has kiddushin for others (she could get kiddushin, but there is something wrong with it being with this man), this is a mamzer.  And which is it?  This is one who has relations with any of the inappropriate relations which is in the torah.  And all who do not have kiddushin for him and does not have kiddushin for others (meaning they are forbidden to everyone), the offspring is like her.  And which is it?  This is the offspring of a maidservant and a non-Jew.Yud Rabi Tarfon says, mamzerim can become pure.  How?  A mamzer who married a maidservant, the offspring is a slave.  If he was freed, the son is found to be a freedman (and passes on pure lineage).  Rabi Eliezer says, behold, this is a mamzer slave.Ten relations (types of lineage) came up from Bavel (in the time of Ezra to rebuild the Beit Hamikdash), kohanim, levi’im, yisra’elim, chalalim (people whose kohen forefathers married a divorcee or chalutza), gerim (converts), charurim (freedmen), mamzerim, netinim, shtukim, and asufim (the last two will be explained in the next mishna).  Kohanim, levi’im, and yisra’elim are mutar to marry each other.  Levi’im, yisra’elim, chalalim, gerim, and charurim are allowed to marry each other.  Gerim, charurim, mamzerim, netinim, shtukim, and asufim are all married to marry each other.And which are shtukim?  Anyone who knows his mother (her lineage) and does not know his father (his lineage).  (Which are) asufim?  All who is taken from the shuk (adopted) ans sors not know is father or his mother.  Abba Shaul would call the shtukim bdukim.All who are assur to come into the congregation (from marrying any of the above forms of Jews, mamzerim, netinim, shtukim, and asufim) are mutar to marry each other, and Rabi Yehuda prohibits.  Rabi Eleizer says, their certain (a mamzer and natin) with their certain is mutar, but their certain with a doubt (explained below), doubt with a certain, or doubt with a doubt is assur.  And which are the doubt?  A shatuk, asuf, and kuti.One (a kohen) who marries a woman who is a kohenet must check (to ensure that her lineage is proper) after her four mothers (four women who make up her lineage) which are eight (for their mothers are checked as well), her mother, her mother’s mother, the mother of the father of her mother (he woman’s great grandmother) and her mother (great great grandmother), her (the woman’s) father’s mother and her mother (the woman’s great grandmother), and the mother of the father of her father (the woman’s great grandmother) and her mother.  For a levi’a and a yisra’el (to marry a kohen), they add upon he one more (generation to each woman listed).They do not check from the mizbe’ach and up (if one of the fathers listed served as a kohen, then they do not check any lineage above him because his lineage was known to pure when he served), not from the duchan and up (a levi who sang on the platform in the Beit Hamikdash), and not from the Sanhedrin and up (even a yisra’el who was on the Sanhedrin).  And all whose forefathers were known to be public officers and organizers of charity, they marry into kehuna (marry a kohen) and do not need to be checked after.  Rabi Yossi says, also one who was signed as a witness in the record office of Yeshana of Tzippori (for the court there kept of record to make sure that only people with proper lineage would be witnesses).  Rabi Chanina ben Antigonus says, also one who was registered in the army of the king (David, for his army only included people of proper lineage).The daughter of a male chalal is eternally pasul from the kehuna.  A yisra’el who married a chalala, his daughter is kasher to the kehuna.  A chalal who married a bat yisra’el, his daughter is pasul from the kehuna.  Rabi Yehuda says, the daughter of a male ger (convert) is like the daughter of a male chalal (pasul to the kehuna).Rabi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says, a yisra’el who married a giyoret (female convert), his daughter is kasher to the kehuna, and a ger who married a bat yisra’el, his daughter is kasher to the kehuna.  But, a ger who married a giyoret, his daughter is pasul to the kehuna.  Whether a ger or whether a freedman, even until ten generations, (they are pasul) until their mother is from yisra’el.  Rabi Yossi says, also a ger who married a giyoret, his daughter is kasher to the kehuna.One who says, this son of mine is a mamzer, he is not believed.  And even if both of them (the man and the pregnant woman) say about the fetus which is in her womb, he is a mamzer, they are not believed.  Rabi Yehuda says, they are believed.One who gave his agent the right to betroth his daughter (to a man while she is still a minor), and he (the father) went to betroth her (to a different man).  If his came first, his kiddushin is kiddushin, but if that of the agent came first, his (the agent’s) kiddushin is kiddushin.  If it is not known (who came first), they both (both of the men who were going to betroth her) give a get, and if they want, one gives a get and one marries.  And so too a woman who gave her agent the right to (accept) betrothal, and (then) she (the woman) went and betrothed herself.  If hers came first, her kiddushin is kiddushin, but if that of the agent came first, his kiddushin is kiddushin.  If it is not known, they both give her a get.  And if they want, one gives her a get and one marries.One who he and his wife went overseas, and he comes (with) his wife and his children and says, the wife I went overseas with, behold this is she, and these are her children, he does not need to bring proof, not on the wife and not on the children.  (If he says,) she died and these are her children, he brings proof about the children, but he does not bring proof about the wife (that she was of proper lineage, for that was done before the marriage).Yud (If a man comes from overseas and says,) I married this woman overseas, behold this is she, and these are her children, he brings proof about the wife and does not need to bring proof about the children.  (If he says,) she died and these are her children, he must bring proof about the wife and the children.Yud One may not be alone with two women, but one woman may be alone with two men (for a man would engage in relations in front of another woman, but not another man).  Rabi Shimon says, also one man may be alone with two women when his wife is with him, and he may sleep with them in an inn, since his wife guards him.  One may be alone with his mother or with his daughter, and he may sleep with them close by (naked), but if they have grown up (either a grown man with his mother or a man with his grown daughter), this one sleeps in her clothes and this one sleeps in his clothes.Yud A man who has never married may not be a teacher, and a woman may not be a teacher (for each may come to be alone with a person of the opposite gender).  Rabi Eliezer says, also one who does not have a wife (even if he has been married before) may not be a teacher.Yud Rabi Yehuda says, a man who has never married may not tend cattle, and two men who have never been married may not sleep in one cloak, and the Chachamim permit.  All who have (business) dealings with women may not be alone with women.  And a man may not teach his son a trade (which includes dealings) with women.  Rabi Meir says, a man must always teach his son a trade which is clean and easy and pray for the One who wealth and possessions are His, for there is no craft where there is no poverty and wealth, that there is no poverty from the trade, and no richness from the trade (meaning every trade has people who are rich and people who are poor), rather everything is according to his merit.  Rabi Shimon ben Elazar says, have you ever seen an animal or fowl which have a trade?  They are provided for without trouble, and weren’t they created to serve me?  I was created to serve my Master, so isn’t is logical that I will be provided for without trouble?  Rather I have made my actions bad and I have forfeited my sustenance.  Abba Gurin a man of Tzadin says in the name of Abba Guria, a man may not teach his son (to be a) donkey-driver, camel-driver, barber, sailor, shepherd, or storekeeper, for their craft is the craft of robbers (each tends towards inappropriate dealings).  Rabi Yehuda says in his name, donkey-drivers, most of them are wicked, camel drivers many of them are proper, sailors, most of them are pious, the best of the doctors (goes to) gehinom (hell), and the most proper of the butchers is partners with Amalek.  Rabi Nehorai says, I leave my craft in this world and I don’t teach my son other than torah, for a person eats from his salary in this world, and the principle lasts for him for the world to come, and the rest of all of the professions are not like this.  When a person comes to the hands of sickness, the hands of old age, or to the hands of troubles, and he cannot engage in his work, he dies in hunger.  But torah is not like this, rather it guards him from evil in his youth, and gives him a future and hope in his old age.  In his youth, what does he say?  “And those who wait for Hashem will renew their strength.”  In his old age what does he say?  “They shall string bring forth with age.”  And so too he says about Avraham our father, upon him may there be peace, “and Avraham was old… and Hashem blessed Avraham with everything.  We found that Avraham did all the torah, in its entirety, before it was given, as it says, “since Avraham heard My voice and kept My keepings, My commandments, My laws, and My statutes.”Mesechet Bava The four categories of damages (are), the ox, the hole, the maveh (animal which eats crops), and the fire.  The ox is not like the maveh, and not like the maveh is like the ox (the mishna is explaining that each category is different).  And this and that, which have in them (the damage) the spirit of life are not like the fire which does not have the spirit of life.  And this and that (the three mentioned categories), the way of which is to go and damage, are not like the pit, for its way is not to go and damage.  The side that is similar in them (all four categories) is that their way is to damage and one must guard them.  And when they damage, the damager is chayav to pay restitution for the damage with the best of the land (idit lands).All which I (any person) is obligated in guarding it, I caused its damage.  If I caused part of its damage, I became chayav in the restitution as if I caused all of the damage.  Objects which do not have me’ila (misappropriation of holy property), property of the people of the covenant (Jews), property which is designated (to owners), and in any place, except for the domain designated for the damager, a domain (shared by) the damaged and the damager, and when he damaged, the damager is chayav to pay restitution with the best of the land.We assess the money (meaning all damage is assessed and then the net is paid), monetary value (is paid from property also), (damages are paid after a ruling) before a court, and based on witnesses who are free men and people of the covenant, and women are included in the (laws of) damage.  And the damaged and the damager (sometimes share) the restitution (sometimes the damager only pays part).Five are tam (simple, the status an ox has if unwarned) and five are mu’ad (forewarned).  An animal is not mu’ad (without any warning) not for goring, not for its body (banging into things), not for biting, not for lying (on something), and not for kicking.  The tooth is mu’ad for something that is fit for it (to eat), the foot is mu’ad to break something while walking, a mu’ad ox (who has done one action three times), an ox who has damaged in the domain of the damaged (even if it has never been warned is considered mu’ad), and a person (who is held to a higher standard).  The wolf, the lion, the bear, the tiger, the panther, ad the snake, behold they are mu’ad.  Rabi Eliezer says, when they are those of culture (domesticated), they are not mu’ad, but the snake is always mu’ad.  What is the difference between tam an mu’ad?  Only that the tam pays half the damage from itself (the damaging ox is sold and the money is used to pay back), and the mu’ad pays the full damage from the best lands.How is the foot mu’ad to break while walking?  An animal is mu’ad to walk in its normal manner and break, (but) if it kicked or bits sprayed from under its foot and broke vessels, he pays half the damage.  If it stepped on the vessel and broke it, and it fell onto another vessel and broke that, one the first he pays the full damage and on the last he pays half damage.  Chickens are mu’ad to go in their normal manner and to break.  If a cord was tied on its foot, or it was scratching and breaking vessels (because it made them hit something hard and break) he pays half the damage.How is the tooth mu’ad to eat that which is fit for it?  An animal is mu’ad to eat fruits and vegetables.  If it ate clothes or vessels, he pays half damage.  What is this talking about?  On the property of the damaged, but in the public domain, he is exempt, but if it benefited, he pays what it benefited.  How does he pay what it benefited?  If it ate from the open square, he pays what is benefited (the money he saved by not having to feed the animal), from the sides of the open square, he pays what it damaged, from the storefront, he pays what it benefited, from inside the store, he pays what it damaged.The dog and the kid that jumped from the top of the roof (where animals would sometimes be kept) and broke vessels, he pays the full damage, since they are mu’ad (they are known to jump off sometimes).  A dog who took a cake, went to a pile of grain, ate the cake, and lit the pile of grain, for the cake he pays the full damage, and on the pile of grain he pays half the damage.Which is a tam and which is a mu’ad (by goring)?  Mu’ad (is) all who they testified about it (goring on) three days, and tam is when he returns from it (goring) for three days, according to Rabi Yehuda.  Rabi Meir says, mu’ad, that they testified about it three times, and tam, any which the children pet it and it does not gore.An ox which damages in the domain of the damaged (which is considered mu’ad), how?  It gored, pushed, bit, lay down, or kicked in the public domain, he (the owner) pays half the damage, (if it damaged) in the domain of the damaged, Rabi Tarfon says, he pays the full damage, and Chachamim say half the damage.  Rabi Tarfon said to them, just as in the place it (the torah) made lenient by tooth and foot (eating or walking on something) when in the public domain and he is patur, and it made strict in the domain of the damaged where he pays the full damage, isn’t it logical that we are strict on it (the types of damage he pays half damage for in the public domain) in the domain of the damaged that he should pay the full damage?  They said to him, it is sufficient for what we infer to be like (in terms of payment) what we inferred from, just as in the public domain he pays half the damage, so too in the domain of the damaged he pays half the damage.  He said to them, I will not infer (laws of) horn (goring) from horn, I will infer horn from foot (walking on something).  Just as a place where it was lenient on tooth and foot in the public domain (for the owner is exempt) it was strict about horn (he pays half damage), a place where it was stringent by tooth and foot in the domain of the damaged, isn’t is logical that we should be strict by horn?  They said to him, it is enough for what we infer to be like what we inferred from, just as in the public domain he pays half the damage, so too in the domain of the damaged he pays half the damage.A person is always mu’ad, whether (he damaged) accidentally or intentionally, whether awake or asleep.  If he blinded the eye of his friend (unintentionally) or broke his vessels, he pays full damage (even for unintentional bodily damage, which generally incurs other payments).One who puts down a jug in the public domain, and another comes and stumbles on it and breaks it, he is patur (for the owner was negligent in leaving it there).  And if he was damaged by it, the owner of the barrel is chayav for his damage.  If his jug broke in the public domain and one slipped on the water (that was in the jug), or he was struck by its shards, he (the owner) is chayav (to pay for the damage).  Rabi Yehuda says, if he intended (to keep the broken pieces or collect the water, it is still his and is like a pit) he is chayav, but if he does not intend, he is patur.One who pours water in the public domain, and one was damaged from them, he (the owner) is chayav for his damage.  One who conceals a thorn or glass, fences his fence with thorns, or a fence which fell into the public domain, and others were injured by them, he is chayav for their damage.One who takes out his hay and straw to the public domain to manure them (make them into fertilizer), and another was damaged by them, he is chayav for his damage, and whoever comes first to them merits to take them (as a fine for endangering others).  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, whoever deteriorates (leaves dung to become usable for fertilizing) in the public domain, and they damaged, they (the owners) are chayav to pay, and whoever comes first to them merits.  One who turns over dung into the public domain (to make an act of acquisition) and another was damaged by them, he is chayav for his damages.Two potters who were walking one after another, the first stumbled and fell, and the second fell on the first, the firs is chayav in the damages of the second.If this one (a person) came with his barrel, and that one (another person) came with his board, (they collided) and this one’s jug broke from the board of that one, he (the one with the board) is patur, for this one had a right to walk (there) and that one had a right to walk.  If the owner of the board was first and the owner of the barrel last (and they collided) and the barrel broke from the board, the owner of the board is patur, if the owner of the board stood (still, causing the owner of the barrel to bump into him), he’s chayav, but if the owner of the barrel said, stand (still), he’s patur.  If the owner of the barrel was first and the owner of the board was last, if the barrel broke on the board, he’s chayav, if the owner of the barrel stood, he’s patur, but if he said to the owner of the board, stand, he’s chayav.  And the same if this one comes with his (lighted) candle and that one comes with his flax (which burnt).Two (people) who were walking in the public domain, one running and one walking or both running, and they damaged each other, they are both patur.One who splits wood in a private domain and damaged (someone) in the public domain, (split wood) in the public domain and damages in a private domain, in a private domain and damaged in another private domain, (the one cutting wood) is chayav.Two tam oxen who wounded each other they pay half the excess of the damage (the one whose ox caused more damage pays half of the difference in damages).  If they are both mu’ad, they pay the full excess damage.  If one is tam and one ismu’ad, the (if the) mu’ad (caused more damage) to the tam, he pays the full excess damage, the tam to the mu’ad, he pays half the excess damage.  And so too two people who wounded each other, they pay the full excess damage.  A person and a mu’ad (ox) or a mu’ad and a person, he pays the full excess damage.  A person and a tam or a tam and a person, a person to a tam he pays the full excess damage, but a tam to a person he pays half the excess damage.  Rabi Akiva, also a tam who wounded a person, he pays the full excess damage.An ox worth a maneh (one hundred zuz) which gored an ox worth two hundred (zuz), and the carcass is worthless, he (the one damaged) takes the ox.  An ox worth two hundred which gored an ox worth two hundred, and the carcass is worthless, Rabi Meir said, on this it was said, “and they shall sell the living ox and split its money.”  Rabi Yehuda said to him, and the halacha is like that, (but) you have upheld, “and they shall sell the living ox and split its money,” but you have not upheld, “and also the dead (ox) they shall split.”  And which (is the case which upholds both)?  This is an ox worth two hundred which gored an ox worth two hundred and the carcass is worth fifty zuz (the hide etc.), that this one takes half the (value of the) living and half the (value of) the dead, and that takes half the living and half the dead.There is (a case where one is) chayav for the action of his ox and patur from his own action, or patur from the action of his ox and chayav for his action.  If his ox embarrassed (someone) he’s patur, but if he embarrassed, he is chayav.  If his ox blided the eye of his slave or knocked out his tooth, he is patur, but if he blinded the eye of his slave or knocked out his tooth, he’s chayav.  If his ox wounded his father or mother, he is chayav, but if he wounded his father or mother, he’s patur (since he incurs strangulation).  If his ox lit a pile of grain on Shabbat, he is chayav, but if he lit a stack of grain on Shabbat, he’s patur because he makes himself liable (to be punished) with his life (stoning for breaking Shabbat).Yud An ox which was chasing after another ox and was damaged (injured), this one says, your ox damaged, and this one says, not so, rather a rock hurt, the one who removes from his friend, upon him is the (burden of) proof.  If two (oxen) were chasing after one, this one (owner of one of the chasing oxen) says, your ox (the other one chasing) damaged (the ox being chased) and that one (the owner of the other chasing ox) says, your ox (owned by the first talker) damaged, they are both patur (because it is not known which one damaged).  If they both belonged to one person, they are both chayav (in a case where both are tam, the owner will only have to pay half of the lesser one, but the damages may be collected from either ox).  If one was large and one was small, the damaged says, the large one damaged, and the damager says, not so, rather the small one damaged or one was tam and on was mu’ad, and the damaged says, the mu’ad damaged, and the damager says, not so, rather the tam damaged, the one who removes from his friend, upon him is the proof.  If the damaged were two, one large and one small, and the damagers were two, one large and one small, the damaged says, the large damaged the large and the small damaged the small, and the damager says, not so, rather the small damaged the large and the large damaged the small, or one tam and one mu’ad, and the damaged says, the mu’ad damaged the large and the tam damaged the small, and the damager says, not so, rather the tam (damaged) the large and the mu’ad the small, the one who removes from his friend, upon him is the proof.An ox (which was tam) which gored four or five oxen, one after another, pays for the last of them (for he pays from the body of the ox, so he only pays the last), and if there is leftover (from paying for the last), he returns to the one before it (he pays the second to last), and if there is leftover from that, he pays to the one before, and the last one, the last one profits (has precedence in payment) , according to Rabi Meir.  Rabi Shimon says, an ox worth two hundred (zuz) which gored an ox worth two hundred, and the carcass is worthless, this takes a maneh and that takes a maneh.  If it went back and gored another ox worth two hundred, the last one takes a maneh and the one before it, this one takes fifty zuz and that one takes fifty zuz.  If it went back and gored another ox worth two hundred, the last one takes a maneh, the one before it fifty zuz, and the first two (involved), a golden dinar (twenty-five zuz each).An ox which is mua’d for its kind (other oxen) and is not mu’ad for other kinds, is mu’ad for people but is and mu’ad for animals, or is mu’ad for small ones (people or animals) but not for large ones, that which it is mu’ad for he pays the full damage, and that which he is not mu’ad for he pays half the damage.  They said before Rabi Yehuda, behold if there is (an ox) mu’ad for Shabbat and not mu’ad for weekdays?  He said to them, on Shabbat he pays the full damage, and on weekdays he pays half the damage.  When is he tam?  When he return from it (goring) three days of Shabbat.An ox of a Jew which gored an ox of hekdesh or an ox of hekdesh which gored an ox of a Jew, it is patur (for there is no damage liability where there is me’ila), as it says, “the ox of his friend,” and not an ox of hekdesh.  An ox of a Jew which gored the ox of a non-Jew, he is patur.  The ox of a non-Jew which gored the ox of a Jew, whether tam or mu’ad, he pays the full damage.The ox of a person of sound senses which gored that f a deaf-dumb, mentally infirm person, or minor, he’s chayav.  And of a deaf-dumb, mentally infirm person, or minor, which gored the ox of a person of sound senses, he’s patur.  The ox of a deaf-dumb, mentally infirm person, or minor which gored, the court enacts for them a guardian, and they testify for them (about the case) in front of the guardian.  If the deaf-dumb became of sound senses, if the mentally infirm person became sane, or the minor grew up, it returns to being a tam, according to Rabi Meir.  Rabi Yossi says, behold he is of his status.  An ox of the stadium (which was trained to gore) is not liable to death, as it says, “when it gores,” and not that they make it gore.An ox which gored a person and he died, if it’s mu’ad he pays the value (of the person), and if tam, he is patur from the value, but this and that are liable to death, like this with a son and like this with a daughter (if they were killed).  If it gored a slave or a maidservant, he gives thirty sela, whether he (the slave) is worth a maneh or if he’s worth only one dinar.An ox which was scratching on a wall and it (the wall) fell on a person, (the ox) intended to kill and animal and killed a person, (intended to kill) a non-Jew and killed a Jew, or an unviable child (which was born too early) but killed a viable child, it is patur.The ox of a woman, the ox of orphans, the ox of a guardian (for a person unable to take care of it), the ox of the desert (which has no owner), the ox of hekdesh, the ox of a convert who died and has no heirs, behold these are chayav death (if they kill a person).  Rabi Yehuda says, the ox of the wilderness, the ox of hekdesh, and the ox a convert who died (without heirs) are patur from death, since they do not have owners.An ox which was going out to be stoned and its owner made it hekdesh, it is not made hekdesh.  If he slaughtered it (though it was going to be stoned) its meat is assur.  And if its owner made it hekdesh before its judgment was finished, it is made hekdesh, and if he slaughtered it, its meat is mutar.If he gave it to an unpaid guardian, borrower, one (a guardian) who takes money, or a renter, they enter in place of the owners, a mu’ad pays the full damage and a tam pays half the damage.  If the owner tied it with its reins and locked (the opening) before it as is proper, and it went out and damages, whether tam or mu’ad he is chayav according to Rabi Meir.  Rabi Yehuda says, a tam is chayav and a mu’ad is patur, as it says (regarding a mu’ad), “and should his owner not guard it,” and this one was guarded.  Rabi Eliezer says, it (a mu’ad ox) has no guarding except a knife (the owner must kill it).An ox which gored a cow and a fetus was found by her side, and it was not known if before it was gored it gave birth or it gave birth form when (after) it was gored he pays half the damage for the cow and a fourth the damage for the child.  And so too for a cow which gored an ox and her child was found next to her, and it is not known if before it gored it gave birth or from when it gored it gave birth, he pays half of the damage from the (value of) cow and a quarter of the damage from the child.A potter who brought his pots into the courtyard of the homeowner without permission and an animal of the homeowner’s broke them, he’s patur, but if it (an animal) was damaged by it, the owner of the pots is chayav.  But if he brought them in with permission, the owner of the courtyard is chayav.  If he brought his produce into the courtyard of a homeowner without permission and an animal of the homeowner’s ate them, he’s patur, but if it was damaged by them, the owner of the produce is chayav.  But if he brought them in with permission, the owner of the courtyard is chayav.If he brought his ox into the courtyard of a homeowner without permission and an ox of the homeowner gored it or a dog of the homeowner’s bit it, he’s patur.  If it gored an ox of the homeowner, he’s chayav.  If he fell into his (the homeowner’s) pit and fouled his waters, he’s chayav.  If his father or his son were in it, he pays their value.  But if he brought it in with permission, the owner of the courtyard is chayav.  Rabi says, in all of them he isn’t chayav, unless he (the homeowner) accepted upon himself to guard (the object brought in).An ox who intended (to gore) its friend (another ox) and hit a woman and she miscarried, he (the owner) is patur from the money (due because) of the child.  And a person who intended (to hit) his friend and hit a woman and she miscarried, he pays the money of the child.  How does he pay the money of the child?  They assess the woman how much she is worth until she gives birth and how much she is worth from when she gives birth.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel said, if so, from when the woman gives birth, her value increases (since there is a danger the woman will die in childbirth).  Rather, they asses the children how much they are worth, and he gives to the husband.  If she doesn’t have a husband, he gives to his (the husband’s) inheritors.  If she was a maidservant and she was freed or a convert, he is patur.One who digs a hole in a private domain and opens it into the public domain, in the public domain and opens it in a private domain, or in a private domain and opens it in another private domain, he’s chayav (if someone is damaged by it).  One who digs a hole in the public domain and an ox or donkey falls into it and dies, (the one who dug the hole is) chayav.  Whether he digs a hole, ditch, cave, trenches, or wedged ditches, he’s chayav.  If so, why does it say a hole?  Just as a hole that it has enough to kill, ten tfachim (of depth), so too anything which has enough to kill, ten tfachim (makes one chayav).  If there were less than ten tfachim and an ox or donkey fell in and died, her’s patur, but if it was damaged in it, he’s chayav.A hole of two partners, if the first passed it and didn’t cover it and the second (passed) and didn’t cover it, the second is chayav.  If the first covered it and the second one came, found it uncovered, and didn’t cover it, the second is chayav.  If he covered it properly and an ox or donkey fell into it and died, he’s patur.  If he didn’t cover it properly and an ox or donkey fell into it and died, he’s chayav.  If it (an ox) fell forward form (fear caused by) the sound of the digging (into the pit), he’s chayav, but if it fell backwards because of the sound of the digging (outside of the pit, but died), he’s patur.  If an ox and vessels fell in and they broke or a donkey and vessels and they tore, he is chayav for the animal and patur by the vessels.  If a deaf, mentally infirm, or minor ox fell into it, he’s chayav.  A son or a daughter, a slave or a maidservant, he’s patur.Whether an ox or any other animal for falling into a hole, for keeping away from Mount Sinai (Hashem commanded animals be kept away from the mountain), paying kefel (if one steals, they pay back double the worth, half of which is a fine called kefel), for returning lost objects, for unloading (the commandment to help an overburdened animal), for muzzling (one may not muzzle an animal while threshing), for kilayim (one may not husband different species or plow with a mixed team), and for Shabbat (animals are also commanded to be rested on Shabbat).  And so too a wild animal, fowl, and things of that sort.  If so, why does it say an ox or a donkey?  Only that the text spoke in the present (used common cases).One who keeps a sheep in a temporary pen and locks before it properly, but it went out and damaged, he’s patur.  If he did not lock before it properly, and it went out and damaged, he’s chayav.  If it broke out at night (when we do not expect him to go find it) or if bandits broke it out and it went out and damaged, he’s patur.  If the bandits took it out, the bandits are chayav.If he left it (the sheep) in the sun (where it might act unnaturally due to the heat), or he handed it over to a deaf-dumb, a mentally infirm person, or a minor (to guard), and it went out and damaged, he’s chayav (for he was negligent).  If he handed it over to a shepherd, the shepherd enters in his place.  If it fell into a garden (it was being guarded on a roof and fell into someone else’s garden) and benefited, he pays what it benefited (how much he saved by not having to feed it).  If it went down as is normal (it was going along normally and then went into someone’s garden) and damaged, he pays what it damaged.  How does he pay what it damaged?  They evaluate a beit se’ah (the area in which a se’ah of seed is sown) in that field how much it was worth, and how much it is worth (now that it has been damaged).  Rabi Shimon says, if it ate finished (ripe) fruit, he pays finished fruit, if (it ate) a se’ah (he pays) a se’ah, if two se’ah, two se’ah.One who makes piles of grain in his friend’s field without permission and an animal of the owner of the field ate them, he (the owner of the animal) is patur.  But if it (the animal) was damaged by them, the owner of the pile of grain is chayav, but if he made piles of grain with permission, the owner of the field is chayav.One who sends fire in the hand of a deaf-dumb, mentally infirm person, or minor, (and it ignites something) is patur in the laws of man (from payment) but is chayav in the laws of heaven.  If he sent in the hand of a person of sound senses, the person of sound senses is chayav.  If one brings the fire and (then) one brings the wood (which ultimately led to the fire damage) the one who brought the wood is chayav.  If one brings the wood and (then) one brings the fire, the one who brought the fire is chayav.  If another came and blew it ablaze, the one who blew it ablaze is chayav.  If the wind blew it ablaze, all are patur.  One who sends (forth) a blaze and it ate (burnt) wood, stones, or earth, he’s chayav, as it says, “if a fire goes forth and finds thorns, a pile of grain is eaten, the standing grain, or the field, the one who set the blaze shall pay (for) the (property which is) burnt.”  If it (the fire) passed (over) a fence four amot high, a public path, or a river, he’s patur.  One who lights within his (property), how far can the fire pass (before he becomes patur)?  Rabi Elazar ben Azaria says, we see it as if it is the middle of a beit kor.  Rabi Eliezer says, sixteen amot, like the way (length needed to declare) of the public domain.  Rabi Akiva says, fifty amah.  Rabi Shimon says, “the one who set the blaze shall pay the burnt,” all goes according to the fire.One who lights a pile of grain and there were vessels in it and they lit, Rabi Yehuda says, he pays what was in it.  Chachamim say, he only pays a pile of wheat or barley (the value of the volume of the pile, as if the vessels were grain).  If a kid was tied to it or a slave was next to it and burned too, he’s chayav.  If a slave was tied to it or a kid was next to it, he’s patur (killing the slave incurs death and the animal could have escaped).  And the Chachamim admit to Rabi Yehuda with one who lights a building, that he pays everything that is in it, for it is the way of people (normal) to put things inside a building (and it is to be expected).A spark which went out from under the hammer (of a blacksmith) and damaged, he’s chayav.  A camel which was loaded with flax, passed in the public domain, its flax entered into a shop, lit on the candle of the shopkeeper, and burned a building, the owner of the camel is chayav.  If the shopkeeper left his candle outside, the shopkeeper is chayav,  Rabi Yehuda says, in a light of Chanukka he is patur (for it is a mitzva to leave it where people can see it).The dealing (application) of kefel restitution (double the principle is paid when someone steals) is greater than the dealing of the restitution of four or five (which is used in specific cases listed below), for the dealing of kefel restitution is done whether with something which has the spirit of life or with something that does not have the spirit of life, but the dealing of restitution of four or five is only done with an ox or sheep, as it says, “if a man shall steal an ox or sheep and slaughter it or sell it etc. (he shall pay four for the ox and five for the sheep).”  One who steals after it was stolen (from the thief) does not pay the restitution of kefel, and one who slaughters or sells after the (first person) steals doesn’t pay the restitution of four or five.If he stole based on (the testimony) two (witnesses) and slaughtered or sold based on them, or based on two others, he pays the restitution of four or five.  If he stole and sold on Shabbat; stole and sold to avoda zara (idolatry); stole and slaughtered on Yom Hakippurim; stole from his father’s (property), sold, and then his father died; or stole, slaughtered, and then made hekdesh, he pays the restitution of four or five.  If he stole and slaughtered for medicine or dogs, (stole,) slaughtered, and found to be a trefa (have internal tears making it not kosher), or slaughtered chulin (non-holy meat) in the courtyard (of the Beit Hamikdash), he pays restitution of four or five.  Rabi Shimon exempts (from the restitution) in these (last) two cases.If he stole based on (the testimony) two (witnesses) and slaughtered or sold based on them, and they were found to be zomemim (conspiring witnesses falsifying testimony whose punishment is what they intended to have done to the other), they pay everything.  If he stole based on two and slaughtered or sold based on two others, and both were found to be zomemim, the first pay restitution of kefel and the last pay restitution of three.  If (only) the last were found to be zomemim, he pays restitution of kefel and they pay restitution of three.  If one of the last was found to be a zomem, the testimony of the other is null.  If one of the first was found to be a zomem, the all of the testimony is null, for is he did not steal it, there is no (way he could have done) slaughtering and no selling.If he stole based on two and slaughtered or sold based on one witness, or based on himself (his own admission, which always exempts one from fines) he pays the restitution of kefel, and he does not pay the restitution of four and five.  If he stole and slaughtered on Shabbat; stole and slaughtered to avoda zara; stole from his father’s (property), his father died, and then sold; or stole, made hekdesh, and then, slaughtered or sold, he pays the restitution of kefel, but he does not par the restitution of four or five.  Rabi Shimon says, holy things (which he made holy) which he is chayav for their responsibility (must safeguard them), he pays the restitution of four or five, and those which his is not chayav for their responsibility, he’s patur.If he sold less than one hundredth of it, had a partnership in (ownership of) it, slaughtered it and it spoiled (improper slaughtering) while in his hands, he pierced it (as a means of killing it), or let it loose (cut the wind pipe improperly), he pays the restitution of kefel, but does note pay the restitution of four or five.  If he stole it from the domain of the owners and slaughtered or sold it outside their domain, stole it from outside their domain and slaughtered or sold it in their domain, or stole and slaughtered or sold it outside of their domain, he pays the restitution of four or five, but if he stole and slaughtered or sold it in their domain, he is exempt (from the restitution of four or five.)If he was pulling it and going out (of the domain of the owner in the process of stealing it) and it died in the property of the owners, he is patur (from kefel).  If he picked it up (an act of acquisition) of he took it out of the domain of the owners and it died, he’s chayav.  If he gave it for the first born of his son (to redeem his first born son), to his creditor, to an unpaid guardian, to a borrower, to one (a guardian) who takes money, or to a renter, and he (the one the thief turned it over to) was pulling it, but it died in the domain of the owners, he’s patur.  If he lifted it up or took it out from the domain of the owners and it died, he’s chayav.One may not raise a thin animal (flock) in Israel (for they eat crops which takes away from settling the land), but one may raise them in Syria and in the deserts in Israel.  One may not raise chickens in Yerushalayim, because of the holy (sacrifices, for they may peck at impure things and defile the sacrifices), and kohanim (may) not (raise chickens) in Israel, because of teharot (holy foods).  One may not raise pigs in any place.  One may not raise a god, unless it was tied by a chain.  One does not set a net for doves unless he was more than thirty ris away from settled areas (for he may be taking doves which belong to someone).One who wounds his friend is chayav on it for five things, damage, pain, treatment, sitting (lost wages), and embarrassment.  For damage, how (do we assess it)?  If he blinded his eye, cut off his hand, or broke his foot, that see him a if he is a slave being sold in the shuk (market), and asses how much he was worth and how much he is worth (now with the wound). (How do we assess) pain?  If he burned him with a (hot) spit or nail, even on his fingernail in a place where he does not make a wound, we assess how much (money) a person like this would take to (agree to) be in that in pain like that.  Treatment?  If he hit him, he is obligated to treat him.  If growths came on it, if it is a result of the blow, he’s chayav, that which is not a result of the blow, he’s patur.  If it healed and then opened up, healed and then opened up, he is chayav to treat him.  Sitting?  We see him as if he is a guard of (a field of) squashes (and give him that wage) for he has already paid him for his hand and his foot (for that type of work can be done even by an amputee).  Embarrassment?  All is according to the one embarrassing and the one embarrassed.  If he embarrasses a naked person, embarrasses a blind person, or embarrasses on who is sleeping, he’s chayav, but a sleeping person who embarrassed is patur.  If he fell from the roof and damaged and embarrassed, he is chayav for the damage and patur for the embarrassment, as it says, “and she sent her hand and held on to is embarrassment,” he is not chayav for embarrassment until he intends for it.This is a stringency by a person from an ox, that a person pays damage, pain, treatment, sitting, and embarrassment, and pays money for children if he causes a woman to miscarry), but an ox doesn’t pay except for damage and is patur from the money of children.If one hits his father or his mother, and he did not wound them, or wounds his friend on Yom Hakippurim, he is chayav in all of them (the five payments).  One who wounds a Jewish slave is chayav in all of them except for sitting when he (the slave) is his (belongs to the damager, for the loss of work hurts the owner).  One who wounds a Cana’ani slave of others is chayav in all of them.  Rabi Yehuda says, slaves do not have embarrassment (for their status is too low).A deaf-dumb, mentally infirm person, or minor, hurting them is bad, and one who wounds them is chayav, and those (a deaf-dumb, mentally infirm person, or minor) who wounded others are patur.  A slave and a woman hurting them is bad, and one who wounds them is chayav, and those who wounded others are patur.  But they pay after time, if the woman got divorced or the slave got freed, they are chayav to pay.One who hits his father or mother and wounded them or wounds his friend on Shabbat is patur from all of them since he is judged (punished) with his life (death). And one who wounds his own Cana’ani slave is patur in all of them.One who hits his friend in the ear, gives him a sela (for embarrassment).  Rabi Yehuda says in the name of Rabi Yossi Hagelili a maneh.  If he struck him (with a flat hand), he gives him two hundred zuz.  With the back of his hand, he gives him four hundred zuz.  If he slit his ear, plucked his hear, spit and his spit got on him (the friend), removed his cloak from him, or uncovered the hair of a woman in the shuk, he gives four hundred zuz.  This is the general rule, all goes according to his honor.  Rabi Akiva said, even the poor people who are in yisra’el (Jews) we see them as if they are freedmen who went down from their property (impoverished noblemen) for they are the children of Avraham, Yitzchak, and Ya’akov.  And there was a case where one uncovered the head of a woman in the shuk, she came before Rabi Akiva, and he obligated him to pay her four hundred zuz.  He said to him, Rabi, give me time, and he gave him time.  He guarded (watched) her (when she was) standing at the opening of her courtyard, he broke a jug before her, and there was an issar’s worth of oil in it (a small amount), she uncovered her head, palmed it (got the oil on her hand), and rested her hand on her head (to oil her hair).  He stood (arranged) witnesses for (to testify about) her and came before Rabi Akiva.  He said, to this one I am giving four hundred zuz (she showed that she did not particularly care to have her head uncovered)?  He said to him, you have said nothing, (for) one who wounds himself, even though he has not right, he’s patur, but others who wounded him are chayav.  And one who cuts down his plants, even though he has no right, is patur, but others who cut down his plants are chayav.Even though he (one who wounds his friend) give him (compensation) he is not forgiven by him until he asks from him, as it says, “and now return the wife of etc. (a case where Avimelech had repented, but Hashem told him to go to Avraham to get cured).”  And from where (do we learn) that the one forgiving should not be cruel?  As it says, “and Avraham prayed to God and God healed Avimelech etc.”  One who says, blind my eye, cut off my hand, or break my foot (if the person does it), he’s chayav.  (If the person adds,) on condition that you are patur, he’s chayav.  Rip my clothes, break my jug, he’s chayav.  On condition that you are patur, he’s patur.  Do so to such-and-such a person, on condition that you are patur, he’s chayav whether to his person or his money.One who steals wood and makes it into vessels, or wool and makes it into clothes, he pays according to the time of theft.  If he stole a pregnant cow and it gave birth, a loaded ewe (full of wool) and sheared it, he pays the money of a cow ready to give birth or a ewe ready to be shorn.  If he stole a cow and it got pregnant by him and gave birth, a ewe and it became loaded by him and he sheared it, he pays according to the time of theft.  This is the general rule, all thieves pay according to the time of theft.If he stole an animal and it aged, or slaves and they aged, he pays according to the time of theft.  Rabi Meir says, by slaves he says to him, behold yours are before you (meaning he simply gives them back).  If he stole a coin and it cracked, fruit and it rotted, or wine and it turned (to vinegar), he pays according to the time of theft.  A coin and it became invalid, truma and it became tame, chametz (leavened bread) and Pesach passed (if it is owned by a Jew over Pesach it is assur to eat) or an animal and a transgression was done with it, it became invalid for the mizbe’ach, or it was going out to be stoned, he says to him, behold yours is before you.If he gave (an item of his) to artisans to fix and they broke it, they (the artisans) are chayav to pay.  If he gave a carpenter a chest, an ark, or a tower (three types of boxes), to fix, and he broke them, he is chayav to pay.  And a builder who accepted upon himself to dismantle a wall and broke the stones or damaged (someone), he is chayav to pay.  If he was dismantling on this side and it fell on another side, he’s patur, but if it was a result of his striking, he’s chayav.One who gives his wool to a dyer and the cauldron burned it, he gives him the money of the wool.  If he dyed it uglily, if the improvement (to the wool’s value) is more than the cost (of dying), he (the customer) gives (pays) him the cost, but if the cost if greater than the improvement, he pays (the value of) the improvement.  (if he gave the wool) to dye it red, and he dyed it black, (to dye it) black and he dyed it red, Rabi Meir says, he gives him the value of the wool.  Rabi Yehuda says, if the improvement is more than the cost, he gives him the cost, but if the cost is greater than the improvement, he gives him the improvement.One who steals from his friend the worth of a pruta (the smallest coin) and swore to him (that he didn’t steal), he must follow after him (to repay the theft) even to Madai.  He may not give to his son and not to his messenger, but he may give to an agent (appointed by) the court.  But if he died, he returns to his heirs.If he (a thief) gave him the principal but did not give him the chomesh (an extra fifth which is added when a person falsely denies a loan or theft), if he (the lender) forgave him the principal but did not forgive him on the chomesh, forgave him for this and that, except for less the worth of a pruta of the principal, he does not have to go after him.  If he gave him the chomesh but he did not give him the principal, he forgave him the chomesh but did not forgive him the principle, or forgave him on this and that except for the worth of a pruta of the principal, he needs to go after him.If he gave him the principal and swore for him about the chomesh (that he had paid it even though he had not), behold he pays chomesh on the chomesh, until the principle (upon which he is paying chomesh) less than the worth of a pruta.  And so too with a deposit (an object left to be guarded), as it says, “with a deposit, pledge, theft, if he oppressed his neighbor, or a lost object and he denied it and swore falsely,” behold this pays the principal, chomesh, and (brings a korban) asham.  (If one says to the other,) where is my deposit?  And he said to him, it was lost, (he said back), I make you swear (that it was lost, and therefore you don’t have to pay), and he said, amen.  (Then) witnesses testify that he ate it, he pays the principal.  If he admitted himself (that he lied) he pays the principal, chomesh, and an asham.(If one said to the other,) where is my deposit?  (And he said back,) it was stolen, I make you swear, and he said, amen.  The witnesses testify that he stole it, he pays the restitution of kefel.  If he admitted himself, he pays the principal, chomesh, and an asham.One who stole (from) his father, swore to him, and (his father) died, behold this one pays the principal and chomesh to his (father’s) sons (his brothers) or his (father’s) brothers (for he loses his inheritance as long as he has the stolen object).  And if he doesn’t want to (lose his inheritance) or he doesn’t have (enough to waive his inheritance), he borrows, (gives the object to his brothers,) and the lenders come and take (the object from the brothers to pay the loan).One who says to his son, konam (expressing a vow against) if you benefit from what is mine,” if he died, he (his son) inherits from him.  (If the father made the vow valid) in his life and after his death, if he died, he (the son) will not inherit from him, and will return to his (the father’s) sons or his (the father’s) brothers.  But if he (the father) doesn’t have, he borrows, and the lenders come and collect.Yud One who steals from a convert and swears from him, and he died, behold this one pays the principal and chomesh to the kohanim and an asham to the mizbe’ach, as it says, “and if the person does not have a redeemer for the man (the thief) to return to him, the guilt (what needs to be paid) is returned to Hashem to the kohen, except for the ram of (Yom) Hakippurim by which he will atone for it.”  If he was brining the money and the asham (to Yerushalayim) and died, the money will be given to his sons, and the (animal designated for) the asham will graze until it develops a blemish, will be sold, and its money will fall into a donation (offering).Yud If he gave the money to the people of the watch (the kohanim serving at that time and died, the heirs cannot take it out from their hands, as it says, “a man who shall give to the kohen, for him (the kohen) it shall be.”  If he gave the money to (the kohanim of the first watch, that of) Yehoyariv and the asham to (the kohanim of the second watch, that of) Yidaya, he’s yotze (fulfills his obligation).  If he gave the asham to Yehoyariv and the money to Yidaya, if the asham is still extant, the children on Yidaya will offer it, but is not, he must return and bring another asham, for one who brings (the payment for) his theft before his asham is yotze, but if he brought his asham before his theft, he’s not yotze.  If he gave the principal, but not the chomesh, the chomesh does not hinder (the asham).One who steals and feeds his children of he put it down before them, they are exempt from paying.  And if it was a thing in which there was a mortgage (land) they are chayav to pay.  We do not change money from the till of customs takers, the pocket of (tax) collectors (for we assume it to be improperly taken) and we do not take charity from them.  But, he may take from (money he keeps in) his house or in the shuk (for his personal money is not necessarily stolen).If tax customs collectors took his donkey and gave him a different donkey or bandits stole his clothes and gave him different clothes, behold they are his, since the owners gave up hope for (someone returning) them.  One who saves (something) from the river, from troops, or from bandits, if the owners gave up hope, behold they are his.  And so too a swarm of bees, if the owners gave up hope (of getting the bees back), behold they are his.  Rabi Yochanan ben Broka said, a woman or minor is believed to say, this swarm came out from here (and therefore this is the owner).  And he may walk inside the field of his friend to save his swarm.  If he damaged, he pays what he damaged, but he may not cut his branch (do any intentional damage) on condition that he will give him money.  Rabi Yishma’el the son of Rabi Yochanan ben Broka said, he may even cut and give the money.One who recognizes his vessels and books in the hand of another, and report of theft went out in the city (was known), the buyer (one who now has the items) will swear to him how much he paid, and he will take (that amount and return the items).  And if not (the theft was not known in the city), we do not give him the power, for I can say he (the one claiming them) sold them to another and this one (who is now in possession) bought them from him.If one comes with his barrel of wine and one comes with his jug of honey, the barrel of honey cracked, and that one pours out his wine and saves the honey in it (his barrel), that one (the one who came with wine) only has his wage (rent for the barrel and salary for his actions, but not money for the wine).  But if he said, I will save yours (the honey) if you give me the money of mine, he is chayav to give it to him.  If a river swept away his donkey and the donkey of his friend, if his is worth a mane and his friend’s is worth two hundred, and if he left his and saved that of his friend, he only has his salary.  But if he said to him, I will save yours if you give me the (the worth) of mine, he is chayav to give him.One who steals a field from his friend, and violent people took it, if it is a blow on the area (including surrounding fields), he says to him, behold your field is before you.  But if it is a result of the thief, he is chayav to stand for him another field (in its place).  If a river flooded it, he says to him, behold your field is before you.One who steals (from) his friend, borrowed from him, or took a deposit from him in a settled area, he may not return to him in the desert (where the thing has a better chance of being ruined).  (If he stipulates) on condition to go out to the desert, he may return to him in the desert.One who says to his friend, I stole from you, you lent me, or you deposited with me, and I do not know if I returned to you or I didn’t return to you, he is chayav to pay.  But, if he said to him, I do not know if I stole from you, if you lent me, or if you deposited with me, he is patur from paying.One who steals a lamb from the flock, returned it, and it (later) died or was stolen, he is chayav for its responsibility.  If the owners did not know about its theft or its returning, and they counted the flock and it was full, he’s patur from paying (if it died or was stolen afterwards).One does not buy from shepherds wool, milk, or kids, and not from watchmen of fruit fruit or wood (for we fear these are all stolen).  But, one buys from a woman wool clothing in Yehuda, linen clothes in the Galil, and calves in Sharon (for these are the common products of the area).  And all who say (to the buyer) to hide (what they buy) it is assur (to buy from them).  And one may buy chickens and eggs from any place.Hackled wool which the washer takes out (stray strands which come out while preparing the wool) behold they are his, but (the threads) which the comber (of the wool takes out) behold they are of the homeowner.  The washer takes three threads and they are his, more than that, they are of the homeowner.  If they were black (threads) on white (clothes) the washer takes them all and they are his (for they make the garment worse).  A tailor who had leftover thread and there is enough to sew with it or (to sew) a patch which is three (fingers) by three, behold these are of the homeowner.  What the carpenter takes off with a plane, behold they are his, but with a hatchet, (they are) of the homeowner.  And if he did it by the homeowner in his domain), even the sawdust is of the homeowner.Mesechet Bava Two are holding a cloak, this one says, I found it, and that one says, I found it.  This one says, it is all mine, and that one says, it is all mine.  This one should swear that he does not have any less than half in it, and that should swear that he does not have any less than half in it, and they split it.  This one says, it is all mine, and that one says, it is half mine, the one who says, it is all mine should swear that he has no less than tree parts (quarters) and the one who says it is half mine should swear that he does not have in it less than a quarter,.  This one takes three parts and that one takes a quarter.If two were riding on an animal, or one was riding and one was leading, this one says, it is all mine and that one says, it is all mine, this one should swear that he does not have in it less than half and that one should swear that he does not have less than half in it, and they split it.  When they admit or they have witnesses, they split without a swear.If he was riding on an animal and said to his friend, give it to me, and he (the friend) took it and said, I merited in it, he merited in it.  If from when he gave it to him he said, I merited in it first, he didn’t say anything.If one saw the finding (ownerless property) and fell on it, and another came and held on it, the one who held on it merited it.  If one saw them (people on his property) running after a finding, after a broken (lame) deer, or after young birds which have not flown, and he said, my field acquired it for me, it merited for him.  If the deer was running as normal or if the young birds were flying and he said, my field merited for me, he didn’t say anything.The finding of his minor son and daughter, the finding of his Cana’ani slave and maidservant, and the finding of his wife, behold they are his.  The finding of his adult son and daughter, the finding of his Jewish slave or maidservant, the finding of his wife who he divorced even though he did not give her her ktuba, behold these are theirs.If he found bills of debt, if there is a deposit of property, he should not return, for the court would collect on them (and we fear the borrower may have already paid), but if there is deposit of property on it, he should return, for the could would not collect on them, according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say, whether like this or like that (in either case) he should not return, because the court will collect on them.If he found the gittin of women, the release of slaves, dispositions of property (such as a will), (bills) of gifts, or receipts (that a man has paid his ktuba), he should not return them, for I say, they were written and he changed his mind not to give them.If he found letters of assessment (a court document assessing collateral given by a borrower, letters of food (a statement that a man undertakes the support of his wife’s daughter from a previous husband), documents of chalitza or denying (that a minor orphan girl refuses her betrothal upon becoming an adult), documents of arbitration (affirming that the parties have accepted arbitration), and all the doings of the court, behold this he should return.  If he found a small bag, case, roll of documents, or bundle of documents, behold these he should return (for they were probably on their way to be delivered).  And how many (together) is bundle of documents?  Three tied to each other.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, if (the bundle has documents which reflect) one borrowing from three, he returns to the borrower, if three borrowing from one, he returns to the lender.  If he found a document between his documents and he does not know its nature (who it should belong to, the borrower or lender), it will be left until Eliyahu comes.  If there are with them (his documents) notes of cancellation (of a loan), he should do what is in the note of cancellation.Which findings are his, and which his he obligated to announce?  These findings are his, if he found scattered produce, scattered money, bunches (of grain) in the public domain, caked of pressed figs, loaves of a baker, strings of fish, pieces of meat, shearings of wool which come from their country (are all similar and unfinished), prepared bundles of flax, and tongues of purple wool, behold these are his, according to Rabi Meir.  Rabi Yehuda says, all which has a change (marking) he is obligated to return.  How?  If he found a cake with (a shard of) pottery in it, or a loaf and there is money in it.  Rabi Shimon ben Elazar says, all merchant’s vessels he is not required to announce.And he is requited to announce, if he found produce in a vessel or a vessel just as it is (empty), money in a pocket (pouch) or a pouch just as it is, heaps of produce, heaps of money, three coins one on top of another, bundles in a private domain, loaves of a homeowner, shearings of wool from the house of the artisan (a workshop), jugs of wine, and jugs of oil, behold these he is obligated to announce.If he found young birds tied behind a stone fence, behind a fence, or on (one of the) paths in the fields, behold he may not touch them.  If he found a vessel in the garbage, if it was covered, he may not touch it, if it is uncovered, he takes and announces.  If he found it in a pile of stones or an old wall, behold these are his.  If he found on a new wall, if from halfway out (on the outer half of the wall), it’s his, if from halfway in it is (property) of the homeowner.  If he rented it (the house) to others (so it may belong to several people), even within the house, behold these are his.If he found in a store, behold these are his.  Between the counter and the storekeeper, (the finding is property) of the storekeeper, Before a moneychanger, behold it there are his, between the chair and the moneychanger, behold these are for the moneychanger.  One who buys produce from his friend of his friend sent him produce and he found money in them, behold these are his, but if they were bound, he takes and announces.(In the torah it says you shall return your friend’s garment and anything that he lost, but) also his garment was included in (saying) all of these (things which are lost), why was it taken out?  To make a hekesh (conclusion drawn based on textual juxtaposition) from it, to say to you, just as a garment is particular for it has signs and those who wish to claim it, so too any thing which has signs and those who wish to claim it, he is obligated to announce.And until when is he obligated to announce?  Until its neighbors (people who live near where it was found) know about it, according to Rabi Meir.  Rabi Yehuda says, three festivals, and after the last festival seven days, such that he may go to his house three (days), return three, and announce one day.If he (one coming to claim the object) said the object but did not say its signs, he does not give it to him.  And a (suspected) cheater, even if he gave its signs, he does not give to him, as it says, “until your brother asks for it,” (expounded to mean) until you ask of your brother, if he is a cheater is he is not a cheater.  Anything which works and eats, will work and eat (the finder must keep, for the owner wants that one to work), but a thing which does not work but eats, he may sell (and return the money).  As it says, “and you shall return it to him,” (meaning) see hoe you return it to him (in what manner is proper).  What will happen with the money?  Rabi Tarfon says, he may use them, therefore if the got lost, he is chayav for their responsibility (for he will have to give back any money he spends).  Rabi Akiva says, he may not use them, therefore if they got lost, he is not chayav for their responsibility.If he found books, he must read from them once every thirty days (to keep them aired out properly), and if he does not know how to read, he rolls them.  But, if he will not learn from them for the first time (he may only review to ensure he does not ware it down) and another may not read after him (for two people might tear one scroll).  If he found clothing, he shakes it out once every thirty days and spread it out for its needs (to keep it aired out), but not for his honor (to decorate his house).  (If he found) vessels of silver or vessels of copper, he uses them for their needs, but not (enough) to wear them down.  Vessels of silver or vessels of gold, he may not touch them until Eliyahu comes (for they will not become degraded).  If he found a sack or a large basket, or any thing which it is not his (normal) way to take it (handle it) behold this does not take (for he may not take care of it properly).What is something lost?  If he found a donkey or a cow grazing on the path, this is not something lost.  A donkey and its vessels (saddle and the like) are backward, or a cow running between the vineyards (in a vineyard, where it does not usually go), behold this is something lost.  If he returned it, it fled, he returned it, and it fled, even four or five times, he is obligated to return it, as it says, “return shall you return it.”  If he lost (the value of) a sela, he (the finder) may not say to him (the owner), give me a sela (which I lost in wages from dealing with your object, rather he gives him his wages as an unemployed worker.  If there is a court there, he (the finder) makes a condition (about being repaid) before the court, but if there is no court there, before who does he make a condition?  His (work) comes first (so he doesn’t have to deal with the lost object).If he found it in a bard, he is not obligated to (care for) it, but if he found it in the public domain, he is obligated to it.  And if it was (in) a graveyard, he does not become tame for it.  If his father said, become tame, of he said to him (about any lost object), do not return it, he does not listen to him.  If he unloaded and loaded (a donkey he sees overburdened), unloaded and loaded, even four or five times, he is obligated (to help), as it says, “help shall you help.”  If he (the donkey’s owner) went and sat, and said, since it is a mitzva upon you, if you want to unload, unload, he (the one watching) is patur, for it says, “(you shall help) with him.”  If he (the owner) was elderly or sick, he (the watcher) is chayav.  It is a mitzva from the torah to unload, but not to load (he may take wages for reloading the animal).  Rabi Shimon says, also to load.  Rabi Yossi Hagelili says, if there was on it more than it could carry, he (the watcher) does not owe him (the service of helping the donkey), for it says, “under its burden,” its burden that it can stand with it.Yud His lost object and the lost object of his father (and he can only deal with one at a time), his lost object comes first.  His lost object and the lost object of his rabbi, his comes first.  The lost object of his father and the lost object of his rabbi, that of his rabbi comes first, for his father brought him into this world, and the rabbi who taught him knowledge brings him to the life of the next world, but if his father is wise, that of his father comes first.  If his father and his rabbi were carrying a burden, he lets down that of his rabbi and then lets down that of his father.  If his father and his rabbi were in captivity, he redeems his rabbi and then redeems his father, but if his father was wise, he redeems his father and then redeems his rabbi.One who deposits by his friend an animal or vessels and they were stolen or got lost, if he paid and didn’t want to swear (that he wasn’t negligent), for behold they said, an unpaid guardian swears and exits (without paying).  If the thief was found, he pays the restitution of kefel, if he slaughtered or sold, he pays the restitution of four or five.  To whom does he pay?  To he who the deposit (the loss) is by him (the guardian).  If he (the guardian) swore and didn’t want to pay, the thief was found, he pays the restitution of kefel, and if he slaughtered or sold he pays the restitution of four or five.  To whom does he pay?  To the (original) owner of the deposit.One who rents a cow from his friend and he lent it to another, and it died in its normal fashion, the renter swears that it died in its normal fashion, and the borrower pays the renter.  Rabi Yossi said, how does this one make a profit with the cow of his friend?  Rather he returns the cow to the owners.If he said to two, I stole a maneh from one of you, and I do not know which one of you, or, the father of one of you deposited by me a maneh, and I don’t know which one it is, he gives this one a maneh and that one a maneh, for he admitted from his own mouth.Two who deposited by one, this one a maneh and that one two hundred (zuz), this one says, the two hundred was mine and that one says, the two hundred was mine, he gives this one a maneh and that one a maneh and the remainder will be left until Eliyahu comes.  Rabi Yossi said, if so, what did the cheater lose?  Rather, all of it is left until Eliyahu comes.And so too two vessels, one is worth a maneh and one is worth a thousand zuz, this one says, the nicer is mine, and that one says, the nicer is mine, he gives the smaller to one of them, and from (sale of) the nicer he gives the money of the smaller to the other, and the rest is left until Eliyahu comes.  Rabi Yossi said, if so, what did the cheater lose?  Rather, everything is left until Eliyahu comes.One who deposits by his friend, even if they are getting lost (wasting away) he may not touch them (sell them).  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, they sell before a court, because it is like he is returning something lost to the owners.One who deposits produce by his friend (but is not sure how much to return), behold he may take from him losses (what is usually lost from produce).  For wehat and for rice (the amount lost is) nine half kabin for every kor, for barley and millet nine kabin for every kor, and for spelt and flaxseed three se’ah per kor, all is according to the measure (of grain) and all is according to the time (it is left with the guardian).  Rabi Yochanan ben Nuri said, and what does it matter to the mice, don’t they eat from a lot (of food) and from a little?  Rather, he only takes out his losses from one kor alone.  Rabi Yehuda says, if it was a large measure, he does not take out his losses because it increases (for the grain is usually deposited when it will be dry and collected at a time it will be wet, so the volume increases).  He may take out from him one sixth for wine (which was deposited but mixed with the guardian’s wine).  Rabi Yehuda says, a fifth.  He may take from him three log of oil from one hundred (if it was mixed), a log and a half for sediment (for that sinks to the bottom and is unusable) and a log and a half for absorption (by the barrels).  If it was refined oil, he may not take from him for sediment, and if the jars were old, he does not take for absorption.  Rabi Yehuda says, also one who sells refined oil to his friend the whole year, behold this one (accepts that he) gets one and a half of sediment for hundred.One who deposits a barrel by his friend, the owners did not have a special place for it, and he moved it and it broke, if because of his hand (moving it) it broke and (he moved it) for his own need, he’s chayav.  If for it’s needs (for the good of the barrel), he’s patur.  If after he put it down it broke, whether (he moved it) for his needs or for its needs, he’s patur.  If the owners had a special place for it, and he moved it and it broke, whether in his hand or from when he put it down (if he moved it) for his needs, he’s chayva, but if for its needs, he’s patur.If he deposited money by his friend, if he tied them and carried them over his back, gave them to his minor son or daughter, or locked before it improperly, he’s chayav, for it is not the way of the guardians.  But if he guarded them like the way of the guardians, he is patur.Yud One who deposits money by a moneychanger, if they are bound, he may not use them, therefore, if they got lost, he is not chayav in their responsibility (to replace them).  If they are unbound, he may use them, and therefore if they got lost, he is chayav in their responsibility.  If (he deposited) by the homeowner, whether bound or unbound, he may not use them, therefore if they got lost, he is not chayav in their responsibility.  A storekeeper is like a homeowner according to Rabi Meir.  Rabi Yehuda says, the storekeeper is like a moneychanger.Yud One who sends a hand (uses) a deposit, Beit Shamay says, he suffers its diminishment and appreciation (owes the owner whatever the change in value was).  Beit Hillel says, (he owes) like the time of taking (he always owes the original value).  Rabi Akiva says, like the time of its claim (by the one who deposited it, meaning he gets whatever it is now).  One who considers sending a hand on a deposit, Beit Shamay says, he’s chayav.  Beit Hillel says, he’s not chayav until he sends a hand in it, as it says, “if he did not send his hand in the work of his friend.”  How?  He tipped the barrel and took a revi’it from it, but it broke, he only pays a revi’it.  If the raised it (an act of acquisition) and took a revi’it from it and it broke, he pays the value of all of it.Gold (coinage) acquires silver (coinage, meaning trading gold for silver automatically acquires the silver), but silver does not acquire gold (an act of acquisition must be made on gold which is traded for with silver).  Copper acquires silver, but silver does not acquire copper.  Worse money (which is not as easily useable, such as gold or copper) acquire better money (silver, which is usable everywhere) but better money does not acquire worse money (since the worse money is seen as a commodity, and giving a commodity acquires by obligating the other party to pay for it, but the better money is seen as a purchase, which is not binding).  An unminted coin acquires a coin, but a coin does not acquire an unminted coin.  Objects acquire a coin, but a coin does not acquire objects.  This is the general rule, all objects acquire each other (bartering is acquisition, but selling is not).How (can we say that objects acquire but money does not)?  If he (a person) took from him (a vendor) produce, but didn’t give him money, he cannot return it (for his taking was an act of acquisition).  If he gave him money but didn’t take produce from him, he can return it.  But they said, He who punished the generation of the flood and the generation of the separation (Tower of Babel) we will punish those who do not stand on their word (return things they have given money for).  Rabi Shimon says, whoever has the money in his hand, he has the upper hand (if money has been given only the vendor can cancel the deal).Ona’ah (cheating) is four silver (ma’ah) out of the twenty-four (ma’ah which are) in a sela, one sixth of the purchase.  Until when is he allowed to return (if he feels he was cheated)?  Until he can show to a merchant or relative (so he can see if he was cheated, but after that it is unreasonably long).  Rabi Tarfon instructed in Lod, ona’ah is eight silver (ma’ah) to a sela, a third of the purchase, and the inhabitants of Lod were happy (for they were experts at trading and would now be able to make more money).  He said to them, the whole day one is allowed to return.  They said to him, let Rabi Tarfon leave us in our place, and they went back to the words of the Chachamim.Whether the buyer or the seller, they have (a right to return) ona’ah.  Just as ona’ah is for a layperson, so too it is for a merchant.  Rabi Yehuda says, there is no ona’ah for a merchant (he may not claim he was cheated, for he is an expert).  The one who was taken from (cheated), he has the upper hand.  If he wants he can say, give me the money, or, give me what you cheated me.Hoe much may a sela be missing (in value due to wear) and it will not have ona’ah.  Rabi Meir says, four issar, an issar per dinar (a sela if four dinar).  Rabi Yehuda says, for pundyon (two issar), a pundyon per dinar.  Rabi Shimon says, eight pundyon, two pundyon per dinar.Until when is he allowed to return?  In cities, until (he has enough time to) show to a moneychanger, and in villages, until the (upcoming) erev Shabbat.  If he (the one who gave the sela) recognizes it, even after twelve months he gets it (back) from him, and he (the one taking back) has nothing on him (is owed nothing) except resentment.  And he can give it for ma’aser sheni and not worry (about punishment) for there is only on him that he is a bad person.Ona’ah is four silver (for every sela), claiming is two silver (this is the minimum considered denying a claim, making one a modeh bemiktzat who must swear that he doesn’t owe the full amount), and admission (the part he admits) is (alteast) with a pruta (the smallest coin, on thirty-second of a ma’ah).  There are five (things which are contingent on the value of) prutot, (and) they are, admission is to the value of a pruta, a woman is betrothed with the value of a pruta, if one benefits from the value of a pruta of holy property it is me’ila, one who finds (something of) the value of a pruta must return it, and one who steals the value of a pruta and swears to him (the one he stole from) must go after him (to return it) even to Maday.There are five (instances of one who must pay) chomesh (an extra fifth on the principal), (and) they are, one who eats truma (a portion removed for the kohanim), trumat ma’aser (a part remove by the levi’im for the kohanim) of dmai (food which we a doubtful of the tithing), challa (a part removed from doughs for kohanim), and bikurim (first fruits which must be brought to the Beit Hamikdash and then eaten), he adds chomesh; one who redeems his neta revai (the fourth year of produce since planting which must be brought to Yerushalayim) and his ma’aser sheni (a tithe which must be eaten in Yerushalayim, both of these may be redeemed such that the produce may be eaten and one spends the money in Yerushalayim), he adds chomesh; one who redeems from his hekdesh (if he decides he wants to use property he consecrated for holy use) he adds chomesh; and one who steals the value of a pruta from his friend but swears to him (that he did not steal), he adds chomesh (when he repays).These things do not have ona’ah, slaves, documents (which function as bonds), lands, and consecrated property.  They do not have the restitution of kefel (if they are stolen), and not the restitution of four or five.  An unpaid guardian doesn’t swear (that he was negligent if they were ruined or lost in his care) and one who takes a salary (as a guardian) does not pay (if these were ruined or lost in his care).  Rabi Shimon says, holy things which he is obligated in their responsibility (if they cannot be brought he must provide a replacement) have ona’ah, and those which he is not obligated in their responsibility, they don’t have ona’ah.  Rabi Yehuda says, also one who sells a torah, animal, or pearls, they do not have ona’ah.  They said to him, they didn’t say (that there is no ona’ah) other than these (which were stated at the beginning of the mishna).Just as ona’ah is in buying and selling, so too there is ona’ah in words.  One may not say to him (another person), how much is this object, if he does not want to buy.  If he (the one being talked to) was a person of repentance (who had repented from prior evil ways), one may not say to him remember your previous deeds.  If he is the child of converts, one may not say to him, remember the deeds of your forefathers, as it says, “and a convert you shall not wrong and you shall not pressure him.”Yud One may not mix fruits (of one field) with fruits (of another field if he markets them as coming from one field), even new (grain which cannot be eaten until Pesach passes) with new, and there is no need to say new with old.  In truth, by wine they allowed to mix hard (strong wine) with soft, because it improves it.  One may not mix the sediment from wine with (other) wine, but he gives him its sediment (with the wine it was part of).  One who mixed water with his wine, he may not sell it in a store unless he informs him (the customer), and not a merchant, even if he informs him, for it is nothing other than a way to cheat with it. (But) a place where they had a custom to put water in the wine, they may put (water in the wine).Yud A merchant may take (grain) from five threshing floors and put into one storeroom, or from give winepresses and put into one barrel, as long as he does not intend to mix (poor quality with better quality to mask it).  Rabi Yehuda says, a storekeeper may not give out toasted grain or nuts to children such that they will be accustomed to come to him, but the Chachamim allow.  And he may not lower the price (so people will come to him and then raise it), but the Chachamim remember him favorably.  One may not sort barley (to remove impurities when selling it) according to Abba Shaul, and Chachamim allow.  But they admit that he may not sort (only) what is at the top of the storeroom (which is seen by customers) for it nothing but stealing the eye (deceiving the customer into thinking all the barley is sorted).  One may not give a deceiving appearance to a person, animal, or vessels (to try to get a higher price when selling them).What is interest (a prohibition from the torah) and what is increase (a rabbinical extension)?  Which is interest, one who lends a sela (four dinar) for (a return of) five dinar, (lending) two se’ah of wheat for three, because it bites (from the borrower’s wealth).  What is increase, one who increases by produce.  How?  If one bought from him wheat with a golden dinar (twenty-five dinar) per kor (gave the money but did not get the produce), and that is the price, .  Wheat (increased in price and) stood at thirty dinar a kor.  He (the purchaser) said, give me my wheat, I want to buy wine with it.  He (the seller) said to him, behold your wheat are made upon me (cost me) thirty dinar a kor, behold, you can have wine by me with them (the money) and he has no wine (for while he owes him the amount of wheat he paid for, despite the loss, he is making it into credit for a different commodity and thereby avoiding his loss, which is not what the customer paid for).One who lends his friend money, he may not live in his courtyard for free and he may not (even) rent from him for less, because this is interest.  A rental fee may be increased, but a price may not be increased.  How?  One who rents his courtyard to his friend and sys to him, if now you give me (the rent) it is for you ten sela for the year, but if you give (the rent) of the month on the month, it is a sela a month, that is mutar.  If he sold him his field, and he said to him, if you give me (the money) now, behold it is for you one thousand zuz, but if (when the grain gets) to the threshing floor, for twelve hundred zuz.Gimmel If he sold him his field, gave him part of the money, and (the seller) said to him, when you want, bring the money and take your field (which you acquire retroactively from now), this is assur (for neither can use the field, because it would be interest either way).  If he lent him on (a mortgage of) his field and he (the lender) said to him if you do not give me from her until three years, behold it (the field) is his (the lender’s).  And Baytos ben Zonin would do like this with the consent of the Chachamim.One may not set up with a shopkeeper for half the wage (sell to a shopkeeper at wholesale prices on condition that they split the profit), and he may not give money (to a shopkeeper) to buy with it produce to split the wage (for in both cases this money functions as half loan half investment, meaning that the investment is seen as interest), unless he gives him his wage as a worker (which would make him the manager of the investment and not benefiting from the loan).  One may not set up chickens (and eggs) for half (the profit to be made from the eggs hatching), one may not assess calves and foals for half (giving them to another to raise and then split the profit), unless he gives him wage for his toil and his food (to feed the animals).  But, one may receive calves and foals for half (the profit without an assessment, meaning there is no liability for the giver if they die) and raise them (calves) until they are a third (of their growth) and a donkey until it can carry burdens.One may assess a cow and a donkey and whatever it does and eats for half (since it is doing work for the one raising, this is not seen as unfair interest).  In a place where they had a custom to divide the offspring (of animals when they are given to someone to raise) immediately, they divide, and a place where they have a custom to raise, they raise.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, they assess the calf with its mother and a foal with its mother.  And one may be mafriz (offer more than the asking price and use the extra as a loan to improve the land) on his field, and he does not have to worry because of interest.One may not get tzon barzel (an agreement where one raising sheep accepts all responsibility for losses but splits profits) from a Jew, because it is interest.  But, one can accept tzon barzel from a non-Jew and borrow from them and lend to them with interest, and so too with a resident alien.  A Jew may lend (to another Jew) the money of a non-Jew (with interest to another Jew) with the knowledge of a non-Jew (where the non-Jew facilitates the transfer of a loan with interest to the non-Jew from one Jew to another) but not with the knowledge of a Jew (it there is no non-Jew with whom the loan is being transferred, i.e. if a loan to a non-Jew which has interest is being transferred directly between Jews).One may not make an agreement about produce until the price is put out (determined).  One the price comes out, they may make an agreement, even though this one does not have, the one does (if one of them does not have produce, he can simply use what he traded for to acquire it when the other asks for his purchase).  If he was the first of the harvesters, he may (only) make an agreement with him about a pile of grain, harvest-basket of grapes, vat of olives, clay lumps of a potter, and lime from when he sunk it in the kiln.  And he may make an agreement with him about manure all the days of the year.  Rabi Yossi says, one does not make an agreement about manure unless he had manure in a dung heap, and the Chachamim allow.  And one may make an agreement with him according to the highest market price (in the eyes of the buyer, referring to the cheapest price).  Rabi Yehuda says, even though he didn’t make an agreement with him for the highest market price, he can say to him, give me this much, or give me my money.One may loan his tenant farmer wheat for (a return of) wheat for (use as) seed, but not for food (for one may not make a loan with a return of produce, for the price may change causing interest).  For Raban Gamliel would loan his sharecroppers wheat for what for seed, whether it was expensive and became cheap or was cheap and became expensive, he would take according to the cheap price (even if the wheat became cheaper he would only take what he gave), but not because the halacha is such, but rather because he wanted to be strict on himself.A person may not say to his friend, lend me a kor of wheat, and I will give (back) you from the threshing floor (for if the price changes, there will be interest).  But he may say, lend me until my son comes, or, until I fink the key (so he can get to wheat which he has, meaning that the loan is intended to be for a short time), but Hillel forbade.  And so too Hillel would say, a woman may not loan a loaf to her friend until she makes money, for perhaps the price of wheat will rise and they will find themselves coming to interest.A person may say to his friend, weed with me and I will weed with you, hoe with me and I will hoe with you, but he may not say to him, weed with me and I will hoe with you, hoe with me and I will weed with you.  All the days of the dry season are (considered) one (in length, so repaying a service from one day of the season to the other has no problem of interest) and all the days of the rainy season are one.  One may not say to him (his friend) plow with me in the dry season and I will plow with you in the rainy season.  Raban Gamliel says, there is interest which is (paid in) advance, and there is interest later.  How?  If one gave his eyes (wanted to) borrow from him (another person), was sending him (a gift), and said, so that you will lend me, this is interest in advance.  If one borrowed from someone, returned him money, was sending him, and said, for your money which was null (from your use) by me, behold this is interest later.  Rabi Shimon says, there is interest by words, one may not say to him (the lender), know that so-and-so came from such-and-such a place (and he would not have normally let the lender know).Yud And these transgress a lo ta’ase (negative commandment when there is a loan with interest), the lender, the borrower, the guarantor, and the witnesses.  The Chachamim also the scribe.  They transgress because of “do not give (a loan with interest),” because of, “do not take (interest) from him,” because of, “do not be to him like a creditor (with interest),” because of, “do not put upon him interest,” and because of, “and before a blind person you shall not put a stumbling block, and you shall fear from your God, I am Hashem.”One who hires artisans, and they deceived one another (if one is working as a contractor and he offers less than what the one hiring offered and pockets the difference) they have nothing on one another except resentment.  If he hired a donkey driver or a potter to bring carriers and flutists for a bride (wedding) or a dead person (funeral), workers to take out his flax from soaking, and anything which will be lost (with time), and they returned from them (retracted), in a place where there is no person he may hire (others) on them (at their expense, for they defaulted) or he may deceive them (the original workers by promising higher wages but not following through).One who hires artisans and they returned from them (retracted), their hand is on the bottom (they have the disadvantage, meaning he subtracts from their wage whatever he had to pay to complete the job).  If the homeowner returns on it, his hand is on the bottom.  Whoever changes (the terms) his hand is on the bottom, and whoever returns on it, his hand is on the bottom.One who rents a donkey to lead it in the mountain and led it in the valley, (or rented it to walk) in the valley and led it on the mountain, even if this is ten mil (of walking) and that is ten mil, and it died, he is chayav (for even though it was the same distance he violated the terms of use).  One who rents a donkey and it got blinded or it was seized for public service, he says to him, behold what is yours is before you.  If it died or broke (was injured) he is obligated to stand up for him a donkey (replace it).  One who rents a donkey to lead it on the mountain and he led it in the valley and it slipped, he is patur (for the one who rented to him for the mountain assumed a risk of slipping), but if it overheated (which was not assumed with the mountain), he’s chayav.  (If he rented it) to lead it in the valley and he led it on the mountain, if it slipped, he’s chayav, but if it overheated, he’s patur, if as a result of the ascent, he’s chayav.One who rented a cow to plow on the mountain and plowed in the valley, if the blade of the plow broke, he’s patur (for it breaks more easily on a mountain).  (If he rented to plow) in the valley and plowed on the mountain, if the blade of the plow broke, he’s chayav.  To thresh legumes and he threshed grain, he’s patur, to thresh grain and he threshed legumes, he’s chayav because legumes are slippery.  One who rents a donkey to bring on it (load it with) wheat and he brought barley on it, he’s chayav (if something happens to the donkey for even if the weights are the same, the volumes are different).  (If he rented it to carry) produce but he brought hay on it, he’s chayav, because the volume is hard to load.  To bring a letech (a volume equal to half a kor) of wheat and brought a letech of barley (which is less dense), he’s patur.  And if he adds on its burden, he is chayav.  And how much must he add on his burden to be chayav?  Sumchus says in the name of Rabi Meir, a se’ah for a camel and three kabin for a donkey.All artisans (who have something in their care) are (equivalent) to paid guardians.  And all (artisans) who said, take what is yours and bring money, (are like an) unpaid guardian.  (If one says,) guard for me (now) and I will guard for you (later), (he is considered) a paid guardian.  (If one says,) guard for me, and he (the guardian) said to him, put it down before me, (he is considered) an unpaid guardian.If one lent him on collateral (the lender is considered) a paid guardian (in matters of the collateral).  Rabi Yehuda says, if he lent him money, he is an unpaid guardian, if he lent him produce he is a paid guardian.  Abba Shaul says, a person is allowed to rent the collateral of a poor person set a price and go (using this money to reduce the debt), for he is like one who returns a lost article.One who moves a barrel from place to place and it broke, whether he is an unpaid guardian or a paid guardian, he must swear (that he was not acting negligently).  Rabi Eliezer says, this and that (both) swear, but I wonder if this and that may swear (for the paid guardian should really be paying for it).One who hired workers and told them to come early or stay late, in a place where it is not the custom to come early or stay late, he cannot force them.  In a place where it is the custom to feed (the workers), he must feed, or (if it is the custom) to provide with sweet (things while they are working), he must provide, everything is like the custom of the country.  There was a case with Rabi Yochanan ben Matia who said to his son, go and hire workers for us.  He went and set for the food, and when he came to his father, my son, even if you made for them like the feast of Shlomo in his time, you did not fulfill your obligation with them, for they are the children of Avraham, Yitzchak, and Ya’akov.  Rather, before they start their work, go out and say to them, (you work for me) on condition that you do not have on me (a right for anything) other than bread and beans alone.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, he didn’t have to say, everything is like the custom of the country.And these (workers) eat (from what they work with, with rights) from the torah, one who does with that which is connected to the ground at the time of the finishing of the work, and with separated from the ground even before the work is finished, and with something which was grown from the ground.  And these (are workers) who do not eat, one who does with that which is connected to the ground when it is not done with its work, with that which is separated from the ground from after the work is done, and with a thing which is not grown from the ground.(He may eat) if he was doing with his hands but not with his feet, his feet but not his hands, even (if the work was) with his shoulder, behold this one eats.  Rabi Yossi bar Yehuda says, (he may not eat) until he does with his hands and feet (which is connected to the prohibition of muzzling an ox, which works with hands and feet, while threshing).If e was doing with figs, he may not eat grapes; with grapes, he may not eat figs.  But he may stop himself until he gets to the place of the nice (best fruit) and eat.  And all of them they didn’t say (they could eat) other than the time of work.  But, because of returning lost objects to the owners they said, the workers may eat on their way from row to row, and when returning from the winepress, and a donkey (can eat until) when it is being unpacked.A worker with squash may eat, even for (the value of) a dinar, and dates, even for a dinar.  Rabi Eliezer Chisma says, a worker may not eat more than his salary, and the Chachamim allow.  But they teach a person that he should not be a glutton and close the door (to more work) before himself.A person can stipulate for himself (to get extra money and not eat), for his adult on and daughter, for his adult slave and maidservant, and for his wife, because they have knowledge (they will understand that they can’t eat), but he may not stipulate for his minor son and daughter, minor slave and maidservant, or for his animals, for they do not have knowledge.One who hires workers to do in his neta revai (four-year-old crop which must be eaten in Yerushalayim), behold these may not eat.  If he didn’t inform them, he redeems and feeds them.  If his cakes (of figs) crumbled of his barrels (of wine) opened, behold these he (a worker) may not eat (for they were most likely not tithed).  If he didn’t inform them, he take ma’aser and feeds them.The guardians of produce may eat from the ways (customs) of the country, but not from the torah.  There are four guardians, an unpaid guardian, borrower, one who takes a salary (paid guardian) and renter.  An unpaid guardian swears (that he was not negligent) about everything (and is exempt from paying), the borrower pays for everything, and the one who takes a salary and the renter swear about something broken, something taken captive, and something which died, and pay for something lost and something stolen.One wolf (which eats a sheep) is not forced (circumstances beyond one’s control which the unpaid guardian, paid guardian, and renter swear for), but two wolves are forced.  Rabi Yehuda says, in a time of a pack of wolves even (if the damage is caused by only) one wolf (the damage) is forced.  Two dogs are not forced.  Yadua the Bavli says in the name of Rabi Meir, from one direction it is not forced, from two directions, it is forced.  Bandits, behold this is forced.  The lion, the bear, the tiger, the panther, and the snake, behold this is forced.  When?  When they come from themselves (of their own accord) but if he led them (the animals in his charge) to a place with hordes of animals or bandits, this is not forced.If it (an animal) died in its (normal) way, behold this is forced.  If he afflicted it (by not giving it proper care) and it died, it is not forced.  If it went up to the top of cliffs and it fell, behold this is forced.  If he brought it up to the top of cliffs and it fell and died, it is not forced.  An unpaid guardian may make a condition that he is exempt from swearing, the borrower to be exempt from paying, and the one who takes a salary and renter to be exempt from swearing and from paying.Yud All who make a condition about (against) what is written in the torah, his condition is null.  And any condition which has an action at its beginning the condition is null (the deed takes place even if the condition is not met).  And any that he can fulfill it eventually and he made a condition about it from the beginning (something that may happen after the deed and he stipulated that it occur after) his condition is valid (the deed is invalid if the condition is not fulfilled).One who borrowed a cow and asked (for the help of) the owner with it or hired its owner with it, or he asked the owners or hired them and afterwards borrowed the cow, and it died, he’s patur, as it says, “if its owner is with it he shall not pay.”  But if he borrowed the cow and then asked the owners or hired them and it died, he’s chayav, as it says, “if its owner is not with it, pay shall he pay.”One who borrows a cow, if he borrowed it half the day and rented it the other half, borrowed it today and rented it for tomorrow, or rented one and borrowed one and it (a cow) died, the lender says, the borrowed one (in the last case) died, (in the second case) the day it was borrowed it died, or (in the first time) during the time it was borrowed it died, and that one (the renter) says, I don’t know, he’s chayav.  If the renter says, the rented one died, on the day it was rented it died, or during the time it was rented it died, and that one says, I don’t know, he’s patur.  If this one says borrowed and that one says rented, the renter must swear that the rented one died.  If this one says, I don’t know and that one says, I don’t know, they will split (the loss).One who borrows a cow and he (the lender) sent it to him in the hand of his son, in the hand of his slave, or in the hand of his agent; or (he sent it) in the hand of the son, in the hand of the slave, or in the hand of the agent of the borrower, and it died, he’s patur.  If the borrower said to him, send it to me in the hand of my son, in the hand of my slave, or in the hand of my agent; or (send it) in the hand of your son, in the hand of your slave, or in the hand of your agent of the borrower said to him, behold I am sending it in the hand of my son, in the hand of my slave, or in the hand of my agent; or (I am sending it) in the hand of your son, in the hand of your slave, or in the hand of your agent; the borrower said, send it; he sent it; and it died, he’s chayav.  And so too at the time he returns it.One who exchanges a cow for a donkey and it (the cow) gives birth, and so too one who sells his maidservant and she gives birth, this one says, (it gave birth) before I sold, and that one says, from the time I bought it, they split (the value of the child).  If one had two slaves, one large (an adult) and one small (a minor), and so too two fields, one large and one small, if the buyer says, I bought the large one, and that one says, I don’t know, he merited in the large one.  If the seller says, I sole the small one, and that one says, I don’t know, he doesn’t have other than the small.  If this one says large and that one says small, the seller must swear that he sold the small one.  If this one says, I don’t know and that one says, I don’t know, they split (the difference).One who sells his olive trees for (the buyer to use as) wood, and they made less than a revi’it (of oil) per se’ah (of olives, meaning the olives were of poor quality), behold these are of the owner of the trees.  If they made a revi’it per se’ah, this one says, my olive trees grew it, and that one says, my land grew it, they split (the oil).  If a river washed out his olive trees and put them into the field of his friend (where they grew olives), this one says, my olive trees grew, and that one says, my land grew, they split it.One who rents a house to his friend (for an unspecified amount of time), during the rainy season, he cannot send him out (evict him) from sukkot until Pesach (foe he will not be able to find a vacancy).  In the season of the sun (dry season), (he must give him) thirty days (of warning).  And in cities, whether in the dry season or to rainy season, twelve months.  And with stores, whether in towns or in citied, twelve months.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, a store of bakers or dyers, three years.One who rents a house to his friend, the owner is obligated in (ensuring that there is) a door, a bolt, a lock, and anything which is the making of an artisan, but a thing which is not the work of an artisan, the renter makes it.  The manure is (property) of the homeowner, and the renter does not have other than what comes out of the oven and the stove alone.One who rents a house to his friend for a year, if the year became a leap year, if became a leap year for (in the favor of) the renter.  If he rented it to him by months, if the year became a leap year, it became a leap year for the owner.  There was a case in Tzippori with one who rented a bathhouse from his friend for twelve gold (dinar, each worth twenty-five dinar) for a year, a golden dinar a month, (and the year became a leap year) and the case came before Raban Shimon ben Gamliel and before Rabi Yossi, and they said, they split the leap month.One who rents a house to his friend and it fell, he is obligated to set up for him a (new) house.  If it was small, he may not make it large, (if the house was) large, he may not make it small.  (If there was) one (house), he may not make it two, two, he may not make it one.  He may not subtract from the windows and he may not add to them, except with the knowledge (consent) of both of them.One who receives a field from his friend (as a sharecropper who pays a part of the harvest), in a place where it was the custom to harvest, he harvest, to uproot (crops by hand) he uproots, to plow after (harvesting so weeds will die) he plows, all is according to the custom of the country.  Just as they divide the produce they divide the hay and stra, just as they divide the wine, they divide the prunings and the reeds (used as trellises), and both of them supply the reeds.On who receives a field from his friend and it is an irrigated field or a field with trees, if the spring dried up or the trees were cut down, he may not deduct from his rent.  If he said, lease me this irrigated field or this field with trees, if the spring dried up or the trees were cut down, he reduces from his rent.One who receives a field from his friend and let it lie fallow, they assess it how much it is fit to make and he (the renter) gives him (the owner), for so he writes to him (in the agreement) if I let it lie fallow and do not work it, I will pay based on the best (yield the field is fit to make).One who receives a field from his friend and did not want to weed, and said to him (the owner) what does it matter to you, since I am giving you your rent.  They do not listen to him, since he (the owner) can say to him, tomorrow (some day) you will go out from me (give me back the field) and it will raise before me grasses (weeds).One who receives a field from his friend and it did not make (produce, so the renter feels it is not worth the trouble), if there was enough to stand (make) a pile of grain, he is chayav to care for it (so he can pay the owner).  Rabi Yehuda says, what is the amount of a pile of grain?  Only if there is in it enough to drop (the amount used to sow the field).One who receives a field from his friend and locusts ate it or it was blasted (by wind ruining the grain), if it is a blow on the district, he deducts from the rent, if it is not a blow on the district, he does not deduct from the rent (for he can say it was the luck of the renter).  Rabi Yehuda says, if he received it from him for money (rented as opposed to tenant or sharecropping) either way he does not deduct from the rent.One who receives a field from his friend for ten kor of wheat a year, if it was blighted, he may give from in it (for the ten kor), and if the wheat was good, he may not say to him, behold I will buy from the shuk, rather he gives him from it.One who receives a field from his friend to sow barley may not sow it (with) wheat (for it takes more from the soil), (if he got it for) wheat he may sow it barley.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel forbids (even the second case).  (If he got it for) legumes, he may not sow it (with) grain, for grain, he may not sow it legumes.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel forbids.One who receives a field from his friend for a few years may not sow it with flax (which takes a lot of nutrients and its roots last for seven years) and he does not have the beams of the sycamore (if there were sycamores, he may not take branches from them, for they take seven years to grow back).  If he received it from him for seven years, in the first year he may sow flax and he has the beams of sycamores.One who receives a field from his friend for one week (seven years) for seven hundred zuz, the shvi’it (which falls during these years) is part of the count.  If he received it from him for seven years for seven hundred zuz, shvi’it is not part of the count.Yud One hired for (work during) the day collects (his wage) the whole night (if after that, the hirer is transgression on the prohibition of withholding wages).  One hired for the night collects the whole day.  One hired by collects all the (following) night and all the day.  One who is hired for a Shabbat (seven days), hired for a month, hired for a year, or hired for a week (seven years), if he went out (finished work) during the day, he collects the whole day, if he went out during the night, he collects the whole night and the whole day.Yud Whether he hired a person, rented an animal, or rented vessels, he has (a responsibility) because (of the commandment) of, “in its day you shall give his wage.”  And he had because of, “you shall not let rest the work of a rented (entity) with you until the morning.”  When?  When he (the hired) claimed it from him.  If he didn’t claim it, he does not transgress on it.  If he ordered it (an equivalent of the wage) by a shopkeeper or by a moneychanger, he does not transgress upon it.  A hired worker, in his time he swears (he was not paid) and takes, if his time passed, he does not swear and take.  If there are witnesses that he (the hired) claimed it, behold this one swears and takes (even after his time has passed).  A resident alien has (transgression) because of, “in its day you shall give his wage,” but he does not have because of, “you shall not let rest the work of a rented (entity) with you until morning.”Yud One who lends his friend may not take collateral from him except in court, and he may not enter his house to take his collateral, as it says, “outside you shall stand (and the borrower will bring out the pledge).”  If he (the borrower) had two vessels (sets of clothes) he takes on and leaves one, and he returns the pillow (which is used as collateral by one who only has one pillow) at night and the plow during the day.  But if he (the borrower) dies, he (the lender) does not return to his heirs (unless they pay back the loan).  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, even to him he does not return except until thirty days, and from thirty days on he sells tem in court (to pay back the debt).  A widow, whether she is poor or rich, one may not take collateral from her, as it says, “and you may not make collateral the clothes of a widow.”  One who takes collateral from millstones transgresses a lo ta’ase (negative commandment) and is chayav for two vessels (the two millstones), as it says, “one may not make collateral from millstones or the upper millstone.”  Not millstones and the upper millstone alone did they say, rather anything with which he makes food for people, as it says, “because he makes a collateral of the man’s life.”A house and an upper room of two (owners) which fell, the two of them split the wood, stones, and earth (which are still usable) and they see which stones are fit to break.  If one of them recognizes some of the stones, he takes them and they count as part of the calculation.A house and an upper room of two, if the upper room was broken and the owner of the house did not want to fix it, behold the owner of the upper room goes down and lives below until he (the homeowner) fixes the upper room for him.  Rabi Yossi says, the lower (owner, of the house) gives the ceiling, and the upper (owner, of the room) gives the pavement (for the floor).A house and an upper room of two which fell down, if the owner of the upper room told the owner of the house to build (the house back up) and he doesn’t want to build, behold the owner of the upper room builds the house and lives in it until he (the owner of the house) gives him his expenses (back).  Rabi Yehuda says, also this one who lives in his friend’s (property) must give him rent, rather the owner of the upper room builds the house and the upper room, puts a roof over the upper room, and sits (lives) in the house until he gives him his expenses.And so too an olive press which is built in a rock (a hill), there is a garden on it, and it broke.  Behold the owner of the garden goes down and sows below until he makes arches for his olive press (to support the garden).  A wall or a tree which fell into the public domain and damaged, he is patur from paying.  If they gave him time to cut the tree or dismantle the wall, and they fell within the (allotted) time, he is patur, but after the time, he’s chayav.One whose wall was next to his friend’s garden and it fell, he (the owner of the garden) said to him, clear away your stones, and he says, they are yours, we do not listen to him.  After he (the owner of the garden) agreed (to remove the stones) he (the owner of the wall) said to him, here is for your expenses, and I will take what is mine, we do not listen to him.  One who hires a worker to do with him in hay and straw, and said to him, give me my wage, and he said, take what you made for your wage, we do not listen to him.  Once he accepted upon himself, here is your wage and I will take what is mine, we do not listen to him.  One who takes out manure to the public domain, the one who takes out takes out, and the one who fertilizes (which can be anyone) fertilizes (may take the manure).  One may not soak mortar in the public domain, and one may not form bricks, but one may knead mortar in the public domain bur not bricks.  One who builds in the public domain, the one who brings stones brings, and (whoever) builds, build (anyone may take the stones), and if it damaged, he (the one who brought the stones) pays what it damaged.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, also he (the builder) may fix (materials for) his work within thirty days (of building and use the public domain).Two gardens one above the other, and the vegetables are between them, Rabi Meir says, they are of the upper (garden).  Rabi Yehuda says, of the lower).  Rabi Meir said, if the upper wanted to take his earth, there would be no vegetable (that would grow) here.  Rabi Yehuda said, if the bottom wanted to fill in the garden, there is no vegetable here.  Rabi Meir said, since either one can stop each other, we see from where this vegetable grows.  Rabi Shimon says, all which the upper can stretch his hand and take, behold it it his, and the rest is of the bottom.Mesechet Bava Partners who wanted to make a divider in the courtyard build the wall in the middle.  In a place where they had a custom to build of unhewn stones, hewn stones, half-bricks, or bricks, they build, all is according to the custom of the district.  With unhewn stones, this one gives three tfachim and that one gives three tfachim (of width to the building of the wall).  With hewn stones, this one give two and a half tfachim and that one gives two and a half tfachim.  With half-bricks, this one gives two tfachim and that one gives two tfachim.   With bricks, this one gives a tefach and a half and that one gives a tefach and a half.  Therefore, if the wall fell, the place and the stones are (property) of both of them.And so too with a garden, in a place where they have a custom to make a fence, they obligate him (to give the space and materials for a fence), but in valleys, a place where they had a custom not to make a fence, they cannot obligate him, rather if he (the abutting owner) wants to (make a fence) he goes into his (land), builds, and makes a marker on the outside (to signify that the fence is his alone).  Therefore, if the wall fell, the space and the stones are his.  If they did it with the knowledge of both of them, they build the wall in the middle and make a marker here and there (on both sides).  Therefore, if the wall fell, the space and the stones are (property) of both of them.One who (has property which) surrounds his friend from three directions, and he made a fence on the first (side), on the second, and on the third, he (the one who made the fence) cannot obligate him.  Rabi Yossi said, if he stood and made a fence on the fourth, they roll in one him all of them (for now that the one surrounded benefits from having a walled in field we obligate him to take part in the building costs).The wall of a courtyard which fell (which divided the property of two people) they obligate him (either of the owners) to build it up to (a height of) four amot.  The presumption that he (one of the owners) gave (money to the other) until he (the other owner) brings proof that he did not bring.  From four amot and up, they do not obligate him (to contribute).  If he mad another wall close to it, even if he did not put the roof on it (for he intended to use the two walls and a roof as a hut), they roll all of it onto him (force him to pay for the building above four amot as well).  There is a presumption that he didn’t give, until he brings proof that he gave.They force him (one owner of a joint courtyard) to build a gatehouse and a door for the courtyard.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, not all courtyards are fit for gatehouses.  They force him (one who lives in a city) to build for a city a wall, two doors, and a bolt.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, not all cities are fit for a wall.  How much (time) must he be in a city and he’ll be like the people of the city?  Twelve months.  If he bought a place to live in it, behold he is like the people of the city immediately.One may not divide a courtyard until there will be four amot for this and four amot for that (each), and not a field until there will be in it nine kabin for this and nine kabin for that.  Rabi Yehuda says, until there will be nine half kabin for this and nine half kabin for that.  And (the may not split) a garden until there will be in it a half kav for this and a half kav for that.  Rabi Akiva says, the space of a rova (each).  And (they may) not (split) a dining hall, not a compartment, not a dovecote (place doves rest), not a garment, not a bathhouse, and not an olive press until there is in them enough for this and enough for that (to get the usage he needs).  This is the general rule, all which he can divide and its name (still applies) on it (to the part each gets, meaning it is enough to be considered a usable object), they divide, and if not, they may not divide.  When?  When they do not both want (to divide it), but when they both want (to divide it) even with less than this they may divide.  And holy writing, even if both of them want, they may not divide.A person may not dig a hole (to collect water) near the hole of his friend, and not a trench, not a cave, not a water channel, and not a washer’s pool, unless he distanced it from his friend’s wall (of the hole) by three tfachim, and he plasters it with lime (so it does not compromise the strength of his friend’s hole).  They distance (a hole with) olive peat, manure, salt, lime, and rocks from the wall of his friend (for these can ruin the water in the hole) by three tfachim and he plasters with lime (so it does not damage his friend’s hole).  They distance seeds, a plow, and urine from the wall by three tfachim.  And they distance (from a friend’s hole) millstones three (tfachim) from the bottom millstone which is four from the top millstone (for the vibration may cause ht hole to collapse), and an oven, three from the base which is four from the lip (of the oven).A person may not stand an oven within the house, unless it has on top of it a height of four amot.  If he stands it in the upper room, there must be below it (a floor) of cement three tfachim (thick), and for a stove a tefach (of cement floor).  And it damaged, he pays what it damaged.  Rabi Shimon says, they did not say all of these measurements, rather if it damaged (with these measurements in place) he is exempt from paying.A person may not open a store of a baker or dyer under the storage room of his friend, and not a cow barn (dairy).  Really, with wine (in the upper room) they permitted, but not a dairy (below, for that will affect even wine).  A store which is in a (jointly owned) courtyard, he (the other owner of the courtyard) can protest and say to him, I cannot sleep because of the noise of those who enter and the noise of those who leave (the shop) One who makes vessels goes out and sells in the shuk, but (if he makes the vessels in the joint courtyard) he (the other owner) cannot protest and say to him, I cannot sleep from the sound of the hammer, not from the sound of the millstones, and not from the sound of the children (if he runs a school).One whose wall was close to his friend’s wall, he may not make another wall close to it unless he distanced from it by four amot (to leave room for pedestrians to walk through).  And (if he wishes to build a wall close to someone else’s) windows, (he must distance) above them, below them, and in front of them four amot.One distances a ladder from a dovecote four amot, such that a marten will not jump (up the ladder to attack the doves), and (one distances) a wall from a gutter by four amot so that he may stand a latter (against the gutter to go clean it).  One distances a dovecote from the city fifty amot (so the doves of another person are not attracted to it, which would be stealing), and a person may not set up a dovecote in his (property) unless he has fifty amot in every direction.  Rabi Yehuda says, space for four kor, the full flight distance of a dove.  But if he bought it even (if it was on only) the space of a rova, behold it is in his holding.A young bird which was found within fifty amot (of a dovecote) behold it is (property) of the owner of the dovecote.  (If it was found) outside of fifty amot, behold it is of its finder.  If it was found between two dovecotes, if it was closer to this, it is his, closer to that, it is his, half by half (exactly in the middle), the two of them split.One distances a tree from the town twenty-five amot, and by a carob and a sycamore fifty amot (because a city gets a public open area around it).  Abba Shaul says, any serak (non fruit-bearing) tree fifty amot.  If the city came first, he (a resident of the city) may cut it down (a tree which is planted too close) and he does not give its money (to the owner), but if the tree came first, he cuts it down and gives the money, if it was a dout if this cam first, a doubt if that came first, he cuts down and does not give the money.One distances a set threshing floor from the city fifty amot.  A person may not make a set threshing floor in his (property) unless he has fifty amot in every direction, and he distances it from the planings of his friend or his plowed field so that it will not damage.One distances nevelot (animals which died naturally), graves, and a tannery fifty amot from the city,  One may not make a tannery other than to the east of the city (so the odor will not be carried to the city, for odors carry best on the east wind).  Rabi Akiva says, he may make it in any direction except for west, and he distances it fifty amot.One distances a soaking (area for flax) from vegetables, leek from onions, and mustard from bees.  Rabi Yossi allows with mustard.Yud One distances a tree from a hole (cistern) twenty-five amot, and with a carob and sycamore fifty amot, whether above (on a hill) or on the side (on flat ground).  If the hole came first, he cuts down and fives money, but if the tree came first, he may not cut down.  If it’s a doubt if this came first, a doubt if that cam first, he may not cut down.  Rabi Yossi says, even if the hole came before the tree he may not cut down, for this one is digging (a hole) in his (land) and this one is planting (a tree) in his 9there is no damage at the time of planting, only later).Yud A person may not plant a tree near his friend’s field unless he distanced 9the tree) from it four amot, whether (he is planting) vines or any tree.  If there was a fence between, this one may come close to the fence on this side and that one may come close to the fence on that side.  If his roots went out into his friend’s (field) he (the friend) may lower them (cut them) up to three tfachim so that it does not hinder the plow.  If he was digging a hole, trench, or cave, he may cut and go down (continue digging) and the wood is his.Yud A tree which is turning towards (growing over) his friend’s field, he (the friend) may cut it the full (height) of the handle on the plow, and a carob and sycamore according to a plumb line (if branches extend over his field, no matter how high, he may cut them).  An irrigated field, all trees are according to the plumb line.  Abba Shaul says, all serak trees are according to a plumb line.Yud A tree which is turning towards the public domain one may cut down such that a camel may pass with its rider.  Rabi Yehuda says, all trees are according to the plumb line because of tuma (for this can make a person tame by being under a covering with a corpse).Chazaka (taking ownership by making acts of possession for a certain length of time) on houses, holes, trenches, caves, dovecotes, bathhouses, olive presses, irrigated fields, slaves, and anything which makes common fruits (is continuously productive), their chazaka is three years from day to day (measured to the day).  A field which is not irrigated, its chazaka is three years, not day to day (three seasons is considered three years).  Rabi Yishma’el says, Three months in the first (year), thee months in the last (year), and twelve months in the middle (year, is sufficient for chazaka), behold eighteen months.  Rabi Akiva says, a month in the first, a month in the last, and twelve months in the middle, behold fourteen months.  Rabi Yishma’el said, what is this talking about?  In a white (grain) field, but in a field of trees, if he collected its produce, gathered its olives, and collected its figs, behold these are three years.There are three lands (regions) for chazaka, Yehuda, Transjordan, and the Galil.  If he was in Yehuda and grasped (possession through chazaka) in the Galil, in the Galil and grasped in Yehuda, it is not chazaka, until it is with him in the region.  Rabi Yehuda said, they did not say three years other than so that it will be if he (the owner) is in Spain, one will grasp for a year, they will go and inform him for a year, and he will come back another (the next) year.Any chazaka which does not have a claim with it is not a chazaka.  How?  If he (the owner) said to him, what are you doing in my (property)?  And he said to him, that a person never told me of this (that it was yours), it is not chazaka.  (If he responds,) that you sold it to me, you gave it to me as a gift, your father sold it to me, or your father gave it to me as a gift, behold this is chazaka.  And one who comes because of inheritance does not need a claim (for inheritance is his claim).  Artisans, partners, tenant farmers, and trustees do not have chazaka.  A man does not have chazaka by the property of his wife, not a woman in the property of her husband, not a father with the property of the son, nor the son with the property of the father.  What is this talking about?  With one who grasp, but when he gives as a gift, brothers who divide (something in their inheritance), one who grasps the property of a convert, and one who locked a gate and it broke any at all, behold this is chazaka.If two (witnesses) were testifying that this one ate it (from a field) for three yeas and they were found to be zomemim, they pay him (the owner) all (the value of the field).  If two (testified) about the first (year), two about the second, and two on the third, (and they are found to be zomemim) they split (the entire cost) between them.  Three brothers (who are testifying) and one combines with them, behold these are three testimonies (for the brothers cannot testify together), but they are one testimony for becoming zomemim (they all have to be found as such for any of them to be punished).These are things which have chazaka, and these are things which do not have chazaka, if he was working his animal in a courtyard, (he set up) an oven and a stove, millstones, a chicken coop, or he was putting his manure in the courtyard, this is not chazaka.  But, if he made a wall for a large animal that is ten tfachim (high), and so too for an oven, so too for a stove, so too for a mill, if he brought chickens into the house, or if he made a place for his manure deeper than three (tfachim) or taller than three, behold this is chazaka.A gutter does not have chazaka (another person may move its downspout), but its place has chazaka (one cannot remove the gutter).  An Egyptian ladder (a type of small ladder) does not have chazaka (cause land it sits on to be owned by the owner of the ladder) but a Tzori (ladder) has chazaka (for it is large and attaches permanently).  An Egyptian window has no chazaka (over the land it sticks out onto), but a Tzori one does.  Which is an Egyptian window?  All which the head of a person cannot enter into it (from size restraints).  Rabi Yehuda says, if it has a frame, even if a person’s head cannot fit into it, this is chazaka.  A projection (from a wall into another person’s property) up to a tefach (and longer) has chazaka, and he (the owner of the land below) can protest.  Less than a tefach, it does not have chazaka, and he cannot protest.A person may not open his window into the courtyard of partners (we do not want others to see into his house).  If he bought a house in a different (adjoining) courtyard, he may not open it (make its opening to the public domain) with the courtyard of partners.  If he built an upper room on top of his house, he may not open it to the courtyard of partners, rather if he wants (to build an upper room), he builds a room within his house, he builds an upper room on top of his house, and opens it into his house.  A person may not open into the courtyard of partners an opening facing an opening or a window facing a window.  If it was small (a window facing another window), he may not make it big.  (If it was) one, he may not make it two.  But, he may open into the public domain an opening opposite an opening and a window opposite a window.  If it was small, he may make it big; one, he may make it two.One may not make a cavity under the public domain, holes, trenches, and caves.  Rabi Eliezer allows, (but it must be strong enough) that a wagon can go loaded with stones (and it will stand).  One may not put out projections or balconies to the public domain, but if he wanted (this structure) he enters (goes back further) into his (property) and puts out (such that it stays in his property).  If he bought a courtyard and there were projections and balconies in it, behold this is in his chazaka (he may keep them there).One who sells a house (without specifying which parts are being sold) has not sold the extension even if it opens into it (the house), not the (external) room which (has an opening) is within it (the house), and not a roof which has a railing higher than ten tfachim.  Rabi Yehuda says, if it (the entrance to the roof) has the form of a (separate) opening, even if it (the railing) is not taller than ten tfachim, it is not sold.(If he sells a house without specifying, he has not sold) not a hole (cistern) and not a cellar.  And he must buy for himself (rights to) a path (that is on the property and leads to something not included in the sale) according to Rabi Akiva.  The Chachamim say, he does not need to buy himself a path.  And Rabi Akiva admits, when he (the seller) said to him, except for these (the listed things) he does not need to by a path.  If he (an owner) sold them (the excluded things) to another, Rabi Akiva says, he (the other) does not need to buy for himself the path, but the Chachamim say he needs to by for himself the path. One who sells a house sold a door but not they key (because it is portable), he sold the stationary mortar, but not portable ones, the lower millstone but the hopper (which collects flour), not an oven, and not a stove.  When he (the seller) said to him, (I am selling) it and everything within it, behold all of them are sold.One who sold a courtyard, he sold houses, holes, trenches, and caves (in the courtyard), but not movable objects.  When he (the seller) said to him, (I am selling) it (the courtyard) and everything within it, behold all of them are sold.  Either way, he did not sell a bathhouse or olive press which is in it.  Rabi Eliezer says, one who sells a courtyard, he did not sell other than the air of the courtyard.One who sells an olive press he sold the sea (a large vat), the pressing stone, and the virgins (support beans).  But, he did not sell the pressing logs, the wheel, or the beam.  And when he said to him, it and everything within it, behold all of them are sold.  Rabi Eliezer says, one who sells an olive press, he sold the beam.One who sold a bathhouse did not sell the floorboards, benches, or the curtains.  When he said to him, it and everything in it, behold all of them are sold.  Either way, he did not sell the water cisterns and not the (fire) woodsheds.One who sells a city sold the houses, the holes, trenches, caves, bathhouses, dovecotes, olive presses, irrigated field, but not movable objects.  When he said to him, it and everything in it, even if there were animals and slaves in it, behold they are all sold.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, one who sold a city sold the guard (even if he did not sell slaves with the city).One who sells a field sold the stones which are for its use (as a fence), the reeds in the vineyard which are for its use (as trellises), the produce which is connected to the ground, a reed fence which is less than the space of a rova, the guard hut which is not made with mortar (is makeshift), a carob which has not been grafted (onto another tree), and the virgin (young, untrimmed) sycamore.But, he (one who sells a field) did not sell the stones which are not for its use, not the reeds in a vineyard which are not for its use, and not the produce which is separated from the ground.  When he said to him, it and everything which is in it, behold all of them are sold.  Either way, he did not sell a reed fence which is the space of a rova, not a guard hut which is made with mortar, not a grafted carob (which is now considered a significant entity), not a full grown sycamore, not a hole, not a winepress, not a dovecote, whether they (the last three) are destroyed (abandoned) or settled (in use).  And he must buy for himself (rights to) a path (that is on the property and leads to something not included in the sale) according to Rabi Akiva.  The Chachamim say, he does not need to.  And Rabi Akiva admits, when he (the seller) said to him, except for these (the listed things) he does not need to by a path.  If he (an owner) sold them (the excluded things) to another, Rabi Akiva says, he (the other) does not need to buy for himself the path, but the Chachamim say he needs to by for himself the path.  What is this (all the exceptions to sales) talking about?  With one who sells, but one who gives as a gift he gives all of them.  Brothers who divided (as an inheritance), the one who merited in the field merited in all of them.  One who grasps (makes a chazaka) on the property of a convert (who died without heirs), he grasped all of them.  One who makes a field hekdesh (property designated for temple use), he made them all hekdesh.  Rabi Shimon says, one who makes a field hekdesh, he did not makes hekdesh other than the grafted carob and the full grown sycamore.One who sells a ship, he sold the mast the sail, the anchor, and the (things which) steer it, but not the slaves, not the sacks, and not the cargo.  But when he (the seller) said to him, it (the ship) and all which is in it, behold they are all sold.  If he sold a wagon, he did not sell the mules; if he sold the mules, he did not sell the wagon.  If he sold a yoke, he did not sell the cattle; if he sold the cattle, he did not sell the yoke.  Rabi Yehuda says, the money informs.  How?  He said to him, sell me your yoke fore two hundred zuz, the thing is known that a yoke is not (sold) for two hundred zuz (and animals are included).  But the Chachamim say, the money is not a proof.One who sells a donkey, he did not sell its vessels (saddle etc.).  Nachum Hamadi says, he sold its vessels.  Rabi Yehuda says, sometimes they sell and sometimes they don’t sell.  How?  If the donkey was before him and its vessels were on it, and he (the buyer) said to him, sell me this donkey of yours, behold its vessels are sold.  (If one asked,) is that donkey yours (and asked to buy it), the vessels are not sold.One who sells a donkey sold the foal (which it gave birth to).  If he sold a cow, he sis not sell its child.  If he sold a dung heap, he sold the manure in it.  If he sold a hole, he sold its water.  If he sold a beehive, he sold its bees.  If he sold a dovecote he sold the doves.  One who buys the fruits of a dovecote (doves that will be born) from his friend makes the first pair fly away (lets the seller keep a pair of young to ensure that the doves will stay there).  (If one brought) the fruits of a beehive, he takes (the first) three swarms and (then) alternates (so the hive will remain populated).  (If he buys) honeycombs, he leaves two honey comes (so the bees will stay).  Olive trees to cut down, he leaves two shoots (so the trees will renew).One who acquires two trees in his friends’ field, behold this one did not acquire land.  Rabi Meir says, he acquired land.  If they grew, he may not trim.  And what comes up from the trunk is his, but from the roots is of the landowner’s.  And if they died, he does not have land.  If he acquires three trees, he acquired land.  If they grew, he may trim them, and what comes up from the trunk or from the roots is his.  And if they died, he has land.One who sells the head of a large animal (cattle) did not sell the legs (for the animal is large, so each part has separate value); if he sold the legs, he did not sell the head.  If he sold the windpipe, he did not sell the liver; if he sold the liver, he did not sell the windpipe.  But, with a thin (animal, meaning sheep), if he sold the head, he sold the legs, but if he sold the legs, he did not sell the head.  If he sold the windpipe, he sold the liver, but if he sold the liver, he did not sell the windpipe.  There are four measures (rules) by sellers.  If he sold him good wheat and they were found to be bad, the buyer can return on it (rescind).  (If he sold) bad (wheat) and they were found to be good, the seller can return on it.  If bad and they were found to be bad, good and they were found to be good, not (neither) one of them can return on it.  If (he intended to sell) dark wood and it was found to be white, white and it was found to be dark, olive wood and it was found to be of sycamore, of sycamore and it was found to be of olive, wine and it was found to be vinegar, or vinegar and it was found to be wine, both of them can return on them.One who sells produce to his friend, if he pulled (the produce toward him) but did not measure it, he acquired it; measured but didn’t pull, he did not acquire.  If he (the buyer) was of sound senses (clever), he rents its place (the place of the grain he has not yet acquired so as to make it his.  One who buys flax from his friend, behold he did not acquire until he takes it from place to place, and if it was connected to the ground and he picked any at all, he acquired.One who sells wine and oil to his friend and they became more expensive or cheaper, if it (the price change) is until before the amount was filled, (the upper hand is) for the seller, if from when the measure was filled, for the buyer.  And if there was a middleman between them (who takes care of the measuring) and the barrel broke, it broke for the middleman (he must replace it).  And he (the seller) is obligated to drop for him three drops (allowing more time for the price to change).  If he (the buyer) turned it over (on its side) and let it drip (the bit which got on the outside of the barrel), behold it (the dripping) is (property) of the seller.  But a storekeeper (as opposed to a private salesman) is not required to drop three drops.  Rabi Yehuda says, erev Shabbat, if it got dark, he is exempt (from adding three drops).One who sends his son to a shopkeeper with a pundyon (two issars) in his hand (to tell the shopkeeper what he wants but not to deliver the goods), he (the seller) measured for him with an issar (worth of oil) and gave him an issar (change), if the jar broke or he lost the issar, the shopkeeper is chayav (for he should have sent it with an adult).  Rabi Yehuda exempts, for for this purpose (we assume) he sent him (his son, to collect the goods).  And the Chachamim admit to Rabi Yehuda that when the jar is in the hand of the child and the shopkeeper measured into it, the shopkeeper is patur (for he brought a jar).A wholesaler wipes his measures once every thirty days, and a homeowner (cleans his measures) once every twelve months.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, it is a switch of the things (the opposite is the case).  A shopkeeper wipes his measures twice a week, polishes his weights once a week, and wipes his scale for every weighing.Yud Raban Shimon ben Gamliel said, what is this talking about?  With moist (products).  But with dry (products) he does not need (to clean the scale).  One must overweigh for him (in the customer’s favor, up to) a tefach.  If he was weighing for him an eye in an eye (exactly), he gives him hi additions (adds to ensure he is not cheating), one in ten with moist, and one in twenty for dry.  A place where they had a custom to measure with a small (measurement) he may not measure with big, (if they have a custom to measure) with a big, he may not measure with small.  To smooth (the top of measures), he may not heap, to heap, he may not smooth (for the costumer may be unable to estimate them)."
