        "Mesechet Taking out on Shabbat are two which are four inside and two which are four outside.  How?  A poor person stands outside and the homeowner inside, the poor person puts out his hand, inside, and the homeowner puts something inside his hand or he took from him and took it out, the poor person is chayav and the homeowner is patur.  If the homeowner puts out his hand, outside, and the poor person put something in his hand or he took something from him and took it in, the homeowner is chayav and the poor person is patur.  If the poor person put his hand inside and the homeowner took something from it or out something in it and he (the poor person) took it out, they’re both patur.  If the homeowner puts his hand outside and the poor person took from it or he put something in it and he (the homeowner) brought it in, they’re both patur.One should not sit before a barber close to mincha (on erev Shabbat), until he davens.  One should not enter a bathhouse, tannery, nor eat, nor judge.  And if they started they do not stop them.  They stop to read shma, and they do not stop for shmone esray.The tailor should not take out his needle close to when it darkens, lest he forget and go out, and the scribe does not go with his pen.  One may not search his garments (for lice) or read by the light of a candle.  They truly said, the chazzan (a teacher) may see where the children read, but he may not read.  Likewise, a zav may not eat with a zava, for habit (leads to) sin.And these are from the laws which they said in the upper chamber of Chanania ben Chizkiya ben Gurion when they went up to visit him, they counted and declared that Beit Shamay was greater (in number) than Beit Hillel, and they decreed eighteen things on that day.Beit Shamay says, one does not soak (on Friday) in ink, dyes, and vetches, unless it’s to dye for that day, and Beit Hillel allows.Beit Shamay says, one may not put bundles of flax into an oven, unless they will be steamed that day, and (one may) not put wool into a pot (of boiling dye) unless it will gather the appearance (that day) and Beit Hillel allows.  Beit Shamay says, one may not set traps for animals, birds, or fish except to trap that day, and Beit Hillel allows.Beit Shamay says, one may not sell to a non-Jew (on Friday), one does not load (an animal) with him, and one does not lift on him (a load which he is carrying), unless he is going to a nearby place, and Beit Hillel allows.Beit Shamay says, one doesn’t give hides to a leatherworker and not vessels (clothes) to a non-Jewish washer, unless they do that day.  And Beit Hillel allows all of them with the sun (still up).Raban Shimon ben Gamliel said, they were accustomed in the house of my father to give white vessels (clothes, which were hard to clean) to the non-Jewish cleaners three days before Shabbat.  And both of these agree that one may load the beams of an olive press (so the oil will be extracted over Shabbat) and the cylinders of a wine press (to further squish the grapes over Shabbat).One may not roast meat, onion, or egg unless they will be roasted that day.  One may not put bread in the oven with (the onset of) darkness, and not charara (a type of cake baked) on coals, unless their surface will crust that day.  Rabi Eliezer says, enough for their bottom to become crusted.Yud One may put the korban pesach down into the oven with nightfall, and one may kindle the fire in a bonfire of Beit Hamoked (a fire in the Beit Hamikdash to warm the kohanim) and in the country, (they may only kindle) if most of them will catch fire.  Rabi Yehuda says, with charcoal, any amount (if lie makes it mutar).With what do we light, and with what do we not light?  One doesn’t light with cedar cambium (material between bark and heartwood), uncarded flax, silk waste product, a wick of willow cambium, a wick if the desert (a certain desert grass), or algae which is on the water (which grows off of boats).  Not with (liquid) tar, (liquid) wax, castor oil, oil which must be burnt (for ritual reasons), fat-tail (of an animal), or forbidden fats (chelev).  Nachum of Mede says, one may light with cooked chelev.  Chachamim say, whether cooked or not, one may not light with it.One may not light with oil which must be burnt on Yom Tov.  Rabi Yishma’el says, one may not light with waste matter from pitch out of respect for Shabbat, and the Chachamim allow with all oils, sesame oil, nut oil, radish seed oil, fish oil, oil from the seeds of a (specific but unidentifiable) wild vine, waste matter from pitch, and gasoline.  Rabi Tarfon says, we don’t light except with olive oil.Whatever comes from a tree (plant) one does not light with except flax.  Whatever comes from a tree (plant) does not become tame as a tent except flax.  A wick made of clothing, which was folded (and braided) but not singed (as a starter) Rabi Eliezer says, it’s tame and may not be lit.  Rabi Akiva says, it’s tahor and may be lit.One may not make a hole in the shell of an egg, fill it with oil, and put it above the candle such that it will drip in, even if it is an earthenware (vessel), and Rabi Yehuda allows it.  But if the potter joined it, originally it’s mutar, since it is one vessel.  One may not fill a bowl with oil, put it beside the candle, and put the wick inside the bowl such that it will absorb.  And Rabi Yehuda allows it.One who puts out a candle out of fear of goyim, bandits, evil spirit, or for a sick person who is sleeping is patur.  If he wants to spare the candle, the oil, or the wick, he’s chayav.  And Rabi Yehuda exempts all except the wick since it makes soot.For three sins women die when they give birth, for not being careful with nidda, challa, and lighting candles.There are three things a person must say on erev Shabbat when it gets dark (and they are), have you taken ma’aser?, have you made an eruv?, and light the candle!  If it is a doubt whether or not it’s (already) dark, one may not take ma’aser from certain (tevel), immerse vessels, or light the candles, but one may take ma’aser from dmai, make an eruv, and insulate hot food.A hotplate which one heated with straw or straw remainders taken from the field, one may put a dish of food on it.  (If he heated) with peat and sticks, he may not put on it until he rakes or until he puts ashes on it.  Beit Shamay says, hot (water may be put on), but not food, and Beit Hillel says, water and food.  Beit Shamay says, one may remove, but not return, and Beit Hillel says, he may even return.An oven which one heated with straw or straw remainders one may not put in it or in it.  A half-sized hotplate (which maintains heat better) which one heated with straw or straw remainders, it is like a hot plate, with peat or wood, it is like an oven.One may not put an egg next to a hot pot so that it will roll, he may not crack it in a scarf (which has been heated by the sun), and Rabi Yossi allows.  And he may not bury it in sand and the dirt of roads so that it will be roasted.Once the people of Tveria brought a pipe of cold (water) into a channel of hot (water, to heat it up).  Chachamim said to them, if it’s on Shabbat, it is like how water which was heated on Shabbat, which are assur for washing and drinking.  If on Yom Tov, they are like hot water which was heated up on Yom Tov, assur for washing and mutar for drinking.  A raked water hotpot may be drunk from on Shabbat.  A water heater (with coals under a vessel for heating) even if raked it may not be drunk from.A hot pot which was removed (from the flame), one may not put into it cold water such that they will get warmer, but he may put it into a cup (with cold water) to make it lukewarm.  The stewpot and cauldron that he removed while boiling, he may not put spices in them, but he may put it into a bowl or a serving dish.  Rabi Yehuda says, he may put it into anything unless there is in it vinegar or brine.One may not put a vessel under the candle to collect from it the oil, but if he put it there during the day it’s mutar.  One may not derive benefit from it, since it is not prepared (for use on Shabbat).  One may move a new candle (never used to light for Shabbat) but not an old one.  Rabi Shimon says, any candle may be moved, except for the one he is lighting that Shabbat.  One may put a vessel under the candle to collect its sparks, but he may not put water in it, since that is extinguishing.With what may one insulate, and with what may one not insulate?  One may not insulate with peat, manure, salt, lime, sand, whether moist or dry, hay, pomace (waste from pressed grapes), soft substances, or herbs, when they are moist, but one may insulate with them when they are dry.  One may insulate with coverings, produce, dove feathers, the sawdust of carpenters, and chips of fine flax.  Rabi Yehuda forbids with fine and allows with coarse.One may insulate with hides and one may move them, with wool shearings but one may not move them.  How does he do this (use the pot if he may not move the insulation)?  He removes the cover and they fall.  Rabi Eliezer ben Azariah says, he tilts it on its side and takes it, lest he take it and be unable to return it (to the basket where it was apparently preserved, for the wool will fill its place).  Chachamim say, he takes it out and returns it.  If he didn’t cover it that day, he may not cover it when it darkens.  If he covers it and it became uncovered, he may cover it.  One may fill a jug and put it under a pillow or a mattress.With what may an animal go out with (put on by the owners, going into the public domain) and with what may an animal not go out?  A camel may go out with a bit, a female camel with a ring (placed in the nose to allow for extra control), an especially difficult donkey with a halter, a horse with a chain, and all animals which go out with a chain may go out with a chain and be pulled by a chain, and (while still on the animal) one may sprinkle them (the chain, to make them tahor if they became tame) and immerse them while they are in their place (one the animal’s neck).A donkey may go out with a cushion for warming it, while it is tied to it (the donkey).  Rams may go out covered (so they do not mount the females), ewes may go out exposed (tail tied up), tied (tails tied down), or covered (to keep their wool clean).  Goats may go out bound (bags on their teats to control milk flow).  Rabi Yossi forbids all of them, except for ewes covered.  Rabi Yehuda says, goats may go out tied.  Rabi Yehuda says, goats may go out tied to dry them (tightly to prevent milk) but not to make them have milk (loosely to protect the milk).And with what do they not go out?  A camel may not go out with a pad on its hump, a front leg tied to a back leg, or its leg tied to its thigh (to immobilize that leg), and so too with all animals.  One may not tie camels to each other and pull, but he may gather the ropes in his hand and pull, as long as he doesn’t wrap (the ropes around his hand).A donkey may not go out with a cushion if it’s not tied to it, not with a bell, even if it is muffled, not with a ladder around its neck (a type of yoke which prevents it from turning its head), and not with a strap on its leg (to protect from rubbing).  Roosters may not go out with strings or straps on their legs, rams may not go out with wagons under their fat-tails, ewes may not go out with nose chips (a device which makes them sneeze and has worms fall from their heads), a calf may not go out with a small yoke, and a cow may not go out with a hedgehog skin (the spikes would protect the teats from being drunk from as the cow sleeps) or a strap between its horns.  The cow of Rabi Elazar ben Azariah would go out with a strap between its horns, which was not according to the will of Chachamim.With what may a woman go out, and with what may she not go out?  She may not go out with wool stings, flax strings, or straps in her hair, and she may not immerse until she loosens it.  (She may not go out with) a frontlet (necklace tied from ear to ear) or headdress when they aren’t sown (onto a hat), or a cap (to protect he neck from the frontlet) to the public domain, and not with a ‘city of gold’ (a crown with an engraving of Yerushalayim), a necklace, earrings, a ring which has no seal, or with a needle which is unpierced.  If she did go out with it, she isn’t chayav a chatat.A man may not go out with nailed sandals, one (sandal) if he doesn’t have a wound, tfillin, an amulet when he’s not an expert (in healing people with amulets), a coat of mail, an army helmet, or army boots.  And if he did go out, he’s not chayav a chatat.A woman may not go out with a pierced needle, a ring with a seal, a diadem, a sachet of perfume, and not with a flask of perfume.  And if she went out, she is chayav a chatat, according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim exempt by a sachet or flask of perfume.The man may not go out with a sword, bow, shield, alah (some object of war), or spear, and if he did go out, he is chayav a chatat.  Rabi Eliezer says, they are ornaments for him.  Chachamim say, they (these weapons) are nothing but reproach, as it says, “they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks, a nation will not raise to a nation a sword, and they will not learn war any longer.  A garter on the thigh is (always) tahor, and one may go out with it on Shabbat.  Foot chains (can become) tame, and may not be taken out on Shabbat.A woman may go out with hair ribbons whether they are hers, her friend’s, or an animal’s, with a frontlet, with a headdress when they are sown, with a cap or a secular wig she may go out to the courtyard, with absorbent cotton in her ear, with cotton (to pad) in her sandal, with absorbent cotton that she set aside for her menstrual cycle, with pepper, with a grain of salt, and anything she will put in her mouth, as long as she isn’t first putting it there on Shabbat.  A false tooth and a gold tooth, Rabi allows and Chachamim forbid.She may go out with a sela (coin) on a foot wound, girls may go out with thread and even chips in their ears.  Women from Arabia may go out veiled, women from Media may go out (with their commonly worn outer coats) fastened, and anyone (may go out like this), rather Chachamim spoke about the present (conditions).She may fasten (the coat) on a rock, a nut, and a coin (a common practice to help form a loop), as long as she didn’t first tie it on Shabbat.An amputee may go out with his artificial leg according to Rabi Meir, and Rabi Yossi forbids it.  And if it has a compartment for pads, it (can become) tame.  His supports get midras tuma (a kind of tuma transmitted to objects used for sitting or laying on), one may go out with them on Shabbat, and he may enter the Temple courtyard with them.  His chair and its supports get midras tuma, one may not go out with them on Shabbat, and they are not brought into the Temple courtyard.  A specific sort of mask is (always) tahor, and one may not go out with them.Sons may go out with knots (on their shoes as a remedy for missing their fathers) and the sons of kings may go out with bells, and so too all people, but the Chachamim speak (based on) the present.One may of out with the egg of a type of locust, the tooth of a fox, and the nail from (where) someone was hanged since they are cures, according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say, even on a weekday it is assur because it is the way of the Emorim.They said a great general rule about Shabbat, whoever forgets the principle of Shabbat and does many melachot (work prohibited on Shabbat) on many Shabbatot, he is only chayav one chatat.  One who knows about the principle of Shabbat (but forgot about it) and he did many melachot on many Shabbatot, he is chayav for each Shabbat.  One who knows it is Shabbat and does many melachot, he is chayav on each category of melacha.  One who does many melachot which are all similar to one melacha (the av melacha) he is only chayav one chatat.There are forty minus one categories of melacha, one who sows, plows, harvests, bundles, threshes, winnows, sorts (out the bad grains), grinds, sifts, kneads, bakes, shears wool, bleaches, cards, dyes, spins, sets the warp (thread) on the loom, makes two loops, weaves two strings, ‘unweaves’ two strings, ties, unties, sews two stitches, tears in order to sew two stitches, traps a dear, shechts it, skins it, salts it, works its leather, smoothes it, cuts it (to size), writes two letters, erases in order to write two letters, builds, dismantles, puts out a fire, lights a fire, strikes with a hammer (completing a process), and takes from domain to domain, behold, these are the forty minus one categories of melacha.And they said another general principle, anything which is fit to be set aside (is of sufficient use to be taken care of) and people set aside things like it (of that size such that it is useful) and one carried it on Shabbat, he is chayav a chatat.  And whatever isn’t fit to be set aside and people don’t set aside things like it, he isn’t chayav, only if the person himself (would) set it aside.One who carries straw (must carry), enough to fill a cow’s mouth; pea stalks, enough to fill a camel’s mouth; sheaves, enough to fill a lamb’s mouth; herbs, enough to fill a kid’s mouth; moist garlic leaves (greens) and moist onion leaves, the size of a dried fig; and dry, enough to fill a kid’s mouth.  They do not combine with one another, since they don’t have equal measures.  One who carries food the size of a dried fig is chayav, and they combine, since they have the same measure, except their skins, pits, stems, and coarse and fine bran.  Rabi Yehuda says, except for the skin of lentils, for they are cooked with them.One who carries wine, enough to mix a cup; milk, enough for a gulp; honey, enough to put on a sore; oil, enough to anoint a small limb (little toe of a newborn); water, enough to dilute eye salve with it; all other liquids, a revi’it; and all that is poured out (non-potable water), a revi’it.  Rabi Shimon says, all of them are a revi’it, and they only said all of these measurements for those who set them aside.One who carries rope, enough to make a handle for a large basket and reed grass, enough to make a holder for a sifter or sieve.  Rabi Yehuda says, enough to take from it the size of a child’s shoe.  Paper, enough to write on it a customs collector’s knot (which the customs collector would write to show that customs had been paid), and one who carries a customs collector’s knot is chayav.  Erased paper, enough to wrap on the mouth of a small flask of a certain perfume.Leather, enough to make an amulet; parchment, enough to write on it the smallest section of the tfillin, which is shma yisra’el; ink, enough to write two letters; and eye shadow, enough to make up one eye.Glue, enough to put on the top of a shoot; tar and sulfur, enough to fix a hole; wax, enough to put on a small hole; clay, enough to seal the hole of a gold-smelter’s furnace.  Rabi Yehuda says, enough to make a peg.  Bran, enough to put on the hole of a gold-smelter’s furnace and lime, enough to paint onto the smallest of girls (one of her fingers).  Rabi Yehuda says, enough to make a hair-crown (a hairdo).  Rabi Nechemia says, enough to make andipy (either redden the forehead or mark off bottles).Earth (possibly a reddish clay), enough to make a seal on a product’s bag, according to Rabi Akiva.  Chachamim say, like the seals of letters.  Manure and fine sand, enough to manure a cabbage stalk, according to Rabi Akiva.  Chachamim say, enough to manure a leek.  Coarse sand, enough to put on a trowel full of lime (used together as a plaster); reed, enough to make a pen; and if it was thick or broken, enough to cook with it the lightest egg beaten and put in a crock.Bone, enough to make a spoon.  Rabi Yehuda says, enough to make (the tooth of) a key.  Glass, enough to scrape (in order to sharpen) with it the top of a shuttle and a pebble or stone, enough to throw at a bird (to scare it away).  Rabi Eliezer bar Ya’akov says, in order to throw at an animal.Earthenware, enough to between a board and the one next to it, according to Rabi Yehuda.  Rabi Meir says, enough to use it to transfer coals.  Rabi Yossi says, enough to hold with it a revi’it.  Rabi Meir said, even though there is no proof for it, there is a mention of it, “and will there not be found among the pieces of earthenware (enough) to transfer fire from the hearth.”  Rabi Yossi says, from that there is a proof (for you?), “and to take out water from a cistern” (is how the pasuk ends, it is a proof for me).Rabi Akiva said, from where do we learn that carrying (but not necessarily touching) avoda zara becomes tame, just as a menstruating woman (nidda).  As it says, “put them as far away as an unclean woman, ‘get out’ shall you tell it.”  Just as a nidda makes tame by carrying so too avoda zara makes unclean by carrying.From where (do we know that) a boat is (always) tahor?  As it says, “the path of a ship in the heart of the sea” (equating the ship to the sea).  From where (do we know that) a bed which is six by six tfachim one may sow five types of seed, four on the four sides and one in the middle?  As it says, “for like the land produces its vegetation and like a garden her seeds she will sprout.”  It doesn’t say, her seed, but rather her seeds.From where (do we know that) a woman who emits semen on the third day (after having relations) is tame?  As it says, “be ready for three days.”  From where (do we know that) one may wash a baby who had a brit mila on the third day if it falls out on Shabbat?  As it says, “and it was on the third day when they were in pain.”  From where (do we know that) that they tie a tongue of red wool on the head of the scapegoat?  As it says, “if your sins will be like red wool, like snow they will be whitened.”From where (do we know that) anointing is like drinking on Yom Hakippurim?  Even though there is no proof for the thing, there is a mention of it, as it says, “and come like water to his insides and like oil on his bones.One who carries wood, enough to cook alight egg; spices, enough to season a light egg, and they combine; nut shells, pomegranate peels, woad (an herb producing blue dye), and madder (an herb producing red dye), enough to dye with them a small garment in a headdress; urine, natron, and lixivium, Cimolian earth (a type of chalk), and potassium, enough to wash a small garment in a headdress.  Rabi Yehuda says, enough to pass over a stain (to check if it is blood or dye).Pepper, any amount; sap from a tree, any amount; various spices and various metals, any amount; from the stones of an altar, the dirt of an altar, worm-eaten books and worm-eaten bands, at all, for people may put them aside to bury them.  Rabi Yehuda says, even one who carries the tools of avoda zara, any amount, as it says, “and it should not stay in your hand anything from the excommunicated.”One who carries a peddler’s basket, even though it has may types, he is only chayav one chatat.  Garden seeds, less than a dried fig.  Rabi Yehuda ben Bteira says, five (seeds).  Squash seeds, two; gourd seeds, two; and Egyptian beans, two.  A live, tahor locust, any amount, and dead, like a dried fig.  The bird of vineyards, whether alive or dead, any amount, for one sets it aside for medicine.  Rabi Yehuda says, even one who carries a live, tame locust any amount, for one sets it aside for children to play with.One who set aside for a seed, to use as a sample, for medicine, or moves it to another domain on Shabbat, he is chayav in any amount.  And all (other) people aren’t chayav on it unless it is of the set measurement.  If he returned and brought in, he is only chayav if it is of the set measurement.One who carries food and places it on the threshold, whether he returned and brought them out or someone else brought it our, he’s patur, since he didn’t do the melacha in one go.  A basket which is full of fruit  and was put on the outer threshold, even though most of the fruits are outside, he’s patur, until he takes the whole basket out.One who takes out, whether with his right or his life, in his bosom, one on his shoulder, he’s chayav, for this is how the sons of Kehat carried.  With the back of his hand, his foot, in his mouth, with his elbow, with his ear, with his hair, with a belt opening downward, between his belt and his cloak, on the hem of his cloak, in his shoe, or in his sandal, he is patur, for he didn’t carry the way people carry.If one intended to carry (an object tied to his cloak) before him, but he carried it behind him, he’s patur.  If he intended behind him and if came in front of him (and was therefore better guarded), he’s chayav.  They truly said, a woman who wraps in an apron, whether in front or behind, is chayav, for it slips around.  Rabi Yehuda says, even the receivers of edicts (which were carried in a tube on a belt which could move about).One who carries a loaf into the public domain is chayav.  If two brought it out, they are patur.  If one (alone) couldn’t take it out and two took it out, he’s chayav, and Rabi Shimon allows it.  One who takes out food less than the set measurement in a vessel, is patur even on the vessel, for the vessel is secondary to it; a live person in a bed, the bed is patur, for the bed is secondary to him; and the dead on a bed, he’s chayav.  And so too a kzayit of a corpse, a kzayit of an animal which died of natural causes, or a lentil sized piece of sheretz, he’s chayav, and Rabi Shimon allows it.One who cuts his nails with each other or his teeth, so too with his hair, mustache, beard, a woman who braids, a woman who uses eye shadow, and a woman who parts her hair, Rabi Eliezer makes chayav, and the Chachamim make assur because of shvut (work which while not prohibited, is against the spirit of sanctity and assur derabanan).  One who plucks from a flowerpot with a hole is chayav, and if it doesn’t have a hole, he’s patur.  And Rabi Shimon exempts both.One who throws from the private domain to the public domain or vice versa is chayav.  From a private domain to a private domain or from a public domain to itself, Rabi Akiva makes him chayav and Chachamim exempt.How?  There are two balconies (private domains) opposite each other in the public domain one, who passes or throws from one to the other is patur.  If they are both in one row (next to each other) one who passes is chayav and one who throws is patur, for this was the work of the levi’im (in the Mishkan, which is where we learn the melachot from), there were two wagons one behind the other in the public domain, they would pass the beams from one to the other, but not throw.  The rim of a pit and a rock which are taller than ten (tfachim) and their width is four (tfachim), one who takes from (on top of) them or puts on top of them is chayav.  If it’s less than this, he’s patur.One who throws (a fig cake) four amot and it sticks to a wall taller than ten tfachim, it is as one who throws in the air (which is patur).  Under ten tfachim, it is like one who throws on he ground (chayav).  One who throws four amot while on the ground is chayav.  If one threw less than four amot and it rolled outside of four amot, he’s patur.  (If he threw) outside of four amot and it rolled inside of four amot, he’s chayav.One who throws four amot into the sea is patur.  If there was a shallow pool of water and the public domain goes into it, one who throws four amot into it is chayav.  And how much is a shallow pool of water?  Less than ten tfachim.  If there was a shallow pool of water and the public domain went into it, one who throws four amot in it is chayav.One who throws from the sea to land or from land to the sea; from the sea to a boat or a boat to the sea; or from a boat to another boat is patur.  If the boats are tied to each other, one may pass from one to the other.  If they aren’t tied, even though they are close, one may not pass from one to the other.One who throws and remembers after it has left his hand, and another intercepted it, a dog intercepted it, or it burnt, he’s patur.  If he threw it in order to in order to make a wound, whether in a person or an animal, and he remembered before it made a wound, he’s patur.  This is the general rule, all who are chayav a chatat aren’t chayav until their beginning and end are (with an intention which is) by accident.  If the beginning is by accident and the end is on purpose or vice versa, they’re patur, until they’re both by accident.One who builds, how much will does he build to become chayav?  One who builds any amount.  And one who unbuilds, hits with a hammer or adze, or bores a hole at all is chayav.  This is the general rule, anyone who does a melacha and his melacha stays on Shabbat, he’s chayav.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, even one who hits with a sledgehammer on the anvil when work is being done is chayav, for it is as if he is improving the work product.One who plows any amount, and the one who weeds, cuts, or trims any amount is chayav.  One who collects wood, if to improve, he’s chayav, but if to heat, enough to cook a light egg.  One who collects herbs, if to improve, any amount, but if (to feed) an animal, enough to fill the mouth of a kid.One who writes two letters, whether with his right or left (hand), whether of one name (letter, i.e. both the same) or of two names, whether from two dyes, and in any language, he’s chayav.  Rabi Yossi said, they only made two letters chayav because it’s making a mark, for this is how they would write on the beams of the Mishkan, to know which is its pair.  Rabi said, we have found a long name (is used) in place of a long name, like Shem from Shimon or Shmuel, Noach from Nachor, Dan from Daniel, and Gad from Gadiel.One who writes two letters in one stint of unawareness is chayav.  If he wrote in ink, sam (a colored earth), sikra (a red dye), gum resin, or calcanthum, with anything which marks (lastingly), the two walls of a corner, the two boards of a writing tablet, and they can be read with one another, he’s chayav.  One who writes on his flesh is chayav.  One who scratches on his flesh, Rabi Eliezer makes chayav a chatat, and Rabi Yehoshua permits it.If he wrote with liquids, fruit juices, the dust of roads, dust of a scribe, and anything which doesn’t last, he’s patur.  With the back of his hand, his foot, with his mouth, and his elbow, or if he writes one letter close to what is written, he wrote on top of something written, he intended to write a chet and wrote two zayins, one in the earth and one on a beam, he wrote on two walls of the house, or on two boards of a writing tablet which don’t go together, he’s patur.  If he wrote a letter after an acronym, Rabi Yehoshua ben Bteira makes chayav, and Chachamim allow.One who writes two letters in two stints of unawareness, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, Rabi Gamliel makes chayav and Chachamim allow.Rabi Eliezer says, one who weaves three strings at the beginning (starting a new garment) or one on a woven patch is chayav.  Chachamim say, whether it’s the beginning or the end, the set measurement is two stings.One who makes two loops, if on heddles (a part of the loom), the sley (an implement which aids the weaving process), the sieve, the sifter, or the basket, is chayav.  And one who sows, two stitches, and one who rips, in order to sow two stitches.One who tears in anger or for the dead, or anything destructive, is patur.  One who destroys in order to fix, the set measurement is like one who fixes.The set measurement of one who bleaches, cards, dyes, and spins, enough to fill a sit (a measurement) twice.  And one who weaves two strings, the set measurement is to fill a sit.Rabi Yehuda says, one who traps a bird into a tower (a closet considered a trap for birds) or a deer into a house is chayav.  Chachamim say, a bird into a tower and a deer into a house, courtyard, or vivarium.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, not all vivariums are the same.  This is the general rule, if it’s missing (a final) trapping, he’s patur, and what isn’t missing trapping (i.e. is trapped in a sufficiently small area), he’s chayav.A deer which entered and one locked it in, he’s chayav.  If two locked him in, they’re patur.  If one couldn’t lock it (alone) and two did, they’re chayav, and Rabi Shimon exempts them.If one sat in the entrance (to the place the deer was)and didn’t fill it, and a second sat and filled it, the second is chayav.  If the first sat in the entrance and filled it, and a second came and sat next to him, even if the first one got up and left, the first is chayav and the second patur.  Behold, what is this like?  Like one who locks a house in order to guard it, and a deer was guarded (by someone else) in the house already.Eight shratzim (a class of animals) are mentioned in the torah, and one who traps them or wounds them is chayav.  Other shekatzim and remasim one who wounds them is patur.  One who traps them for a use is chayav, not for any use is patur.  A wild animal or fowl which is in his domain, one who traps them is patur, and one who wounds them is chayav.One may not make himli (a saltwater brine made in large quantities), but one may make salt water and dip his bread in it, and dip in cooked food.  Rabi Yossi said, and isn’t it (the salt water) himli, whether a lot (himli) or a little?  And these are the permitted salt waters, if he first puts the oil (used in himli) in the water or the salt (and not make straight salt water at any time, which is seen as part of curing foods).One may not eat Greek hyssop on Shabbat, because it is not food of healthy people (it was used as medicine), but he may eat maidenhair and drink liverwort.  One may eat anything as a medicine and drink anything except for palm water (water from a specific spring in Israel) and a cup of root (tea), because they are for jaundice (and it will be clear that he is taking them to cure his jaundice).  But he may drink palm water if he’s thirsty and anoint with root oil if not for medicine.One who feels pain in his teeth, he may not swallow vinegar, but he may dip (in vinegar) as he normally would, and if he is healed, he is healed.  One who feels pain in his loins may not anoint in wine or vinegar, but he may anoint with oil, but not rose oil.  Royalty may anoint with rose oil on their wounds, for this is how they anoint during the week.  Rabi Shimon says, all Jews are royalty."
