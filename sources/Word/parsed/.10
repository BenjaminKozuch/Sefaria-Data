        "Mesechet Shvi’Until when may one plow in an orchard before shmitta?  Beit Shamay says, as long as the fruits will actually benefit (the fruits of the sixth year).  Beit Hillel says, until Shavuot, and their words are very similar.What makes an orchard?  Any three trees in a beit se’ah.  If they can yield a cake of pressed figs of a certain weight, you may plow the entire area for it benefits the trees.  If they don’t yield that much you may only plow the area around each tree taken up by the worker and the basket outside of him.Whether a sarak or fruit tree, you see them as if they bear figs, if they make the required amount, you can plow the whole area, for it’s for their need.  And if not, you may only plow what they need.If one tree makes enough, but two don’t, or two make and one doesn’t, you may only plow what they need until they are between three and nine.  If there are ten and up, whether or not they make enough you may plow the whole beit se’ah for their need, as it says, “in plowing and harvesting you shall rest,” it didn’t need to say the plowing and harvesting of shmitta, rather plowing of erev shvi’it when shmitta is entering and harvesting of shmitta when it is going out to motzei shvi’it.  Rabi Yishma’el says, just as it is optional plowing, so too it is optional harvesting, which excludes harvesting for omer.Three trees which belong to three people, these combine, and you plow the entire beit se’ah for them.  How much must be left between them?  Raban Gamliel says, enough for an ox can pass with the plowing tools.Ten saplings spread about a beit se’ah, one may plow the entire space for them up until Rosh Hashana (so they won’t dry up).  If they were planted in a row and surrounded by a fence you may only plow what they need.Saplings and gourds combine in a beit se’ah.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, if there are ten gourds in a beit se’ah, one may plow it all until Rosh Hashana.Until when are they considered saplings? Rabi Elazar ben Azariah says, until they become permitted (from orla).  Rabi Yehoshua says until seven years.  Rabi Akiva says as long as they are called saplings.  A tree that was cut down and produced new roots less than a tefach, it’s a sapling, but if more than a tefach, it’s a tree, according to Rabi Shimon.Until when may one plow in a ‘white’ field (not trees) be plowed on erev shvi’it?  Until the moisture has dried up, as long as people plow to plant squash and gourds.  Rabi Shimon said, you give law for each person individually (for fields dry up at different times).  Rather in a field until Pesach and an orchard until Shavuot.One spreads manure and hoes squash and gourds until Rosh Hashana.  And so too in irrigated fields.  One may cut off flaws, strip leaves, cover up, or smoke out until Rosh Hashana.  Rabi Shimon says, one may even remove a leaf from a cluster of grapes on shmitta.One may clear stones until Rosh Hashana.  One may clip, prune, and trim until Rosh Hashana.  Rabi Yehoshua says, like clipping and pruning of the fifth year (which continue into the next year) are clipping and pruning of the sixth year.  Rabi Shimon says, whenever I may work on a tree (until Shavuot) I may trim.One may smear wounds on saplings with dung, wrap them, trim them, make shelter for them, and water them until Rosh Hashana.  Rabi Elazar ben Tzadok says, even during shmitta you may water the branches but not the trunk.One may oil unripe figs and pierce them until Rosh Hashana.  Unripe figs of erev shvi’it that entered shvi’it and those of shvi’it that entered motzei shvi’it may not be oiled or pierced.  Rabi Yehuda says, a place where they would oil, they don’t oil, for it’s work, and a place where they don’t oil, you may oil.  Rabi Shimon allows work on a tree (even though it is shvi’it fruit), for work on a tree is allowed (in the eighth year).One may not plant, make runners, or graft erev shvi’it less than thirty days before Rosh Hashana.  If you planted, made runners, or grafted, you must uproot it.  Rabi Yehuda says, any grafting that has not taken root in three days will never take root.  Rabi Yossi and Rabi Shimon say, two weeks.Rice, millet, poppy, and sesame which grew roots before Rosh Hashana, you take ma’aser for the past year, and they are allowed on shvi’it.  And if not, they are assur on shvi’it and you take ma’aser the next year.Rabi Shimon Shezuri says, Egyptian bean that was planted, but for the purpose of seeds, by the beginning of shvi’it has the same rules as above.  Rabi Shimon says, large peas are also like them.  Rabi Elazar says, large peas if they began to form pods before Rosh Hashana.Seedless onions and Egyptian beans which one prevented from getting water starting thirty days before Rosh Hashana, one takes ma’aser with the past year, and they are allowed on shvi’it.  If not, they are forbidden on shvi’it, and one takes ma’aser with the coming year.  In a rain irrigated field, if one prevented them from getting water for two seasons, according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say three seasons.Gourds which one made for seeds, if they hardened before Rosh Hashana and become unfit as human food, if is mutar to keep them during shvi’it.  If not, it is assur to keep them on shvi’it.  Their truma is assur on shvi’it. And one may water ‘white’ soil (non-orchard) according to Rabi Shimon.  Rabi Eliezer ben Ya’akov forbids it.  One may soak rice on shvi’it.  Rabi Shimon says, but you don’t trim the leaves.From when may one prepare manure in heaps (during shvi’it)?  When those who do work their fields on shvi’it (e.g. non-Jews) stop, according to Rabi Meir.  Rabi Yehuda says, from when the manure dries up.  Rabi Yossi says, from when the manure dries enough to form solid pallets.How much manure can be deposited in the heaps?  Until three dung heaps per beit se’ah, each containing ten baskets of a letech (a unit of measurement making each heap 150 se’ah).  One may increase the number of baskets per heap, but not the number of heaps.  Rabi Shimon says, even the number of heaps.One makes his field with three dung heaps in each se’ah.  If he makes more, he makes them into a triangle, according to Rabi Shimon.  Chachamim forbid making more piles unless they are three tfachim above or below the flat parts of the field.  One may make his dung heap one large pile.  Rabi Meir forbids this unless he raises or lowers it three tfachim.  If he had a small heap, he can add to it repetitively (not all his manure at one time).  Rabi Elazar ben Azariah forbids unless he lowers or raises three tfachim.One who uses a field to let cows graze (and make manure), he must make the pen two beit se’ah.  He removes three sides and leaves the wall that stays between the old and new pen and makes a pen that makes a total of four beit se’ah.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, the pen can be eight beit se’ah.  If his whole field is four beit se’ah, he leaves part of it (unenclosed), because of marit ayin, and takes from the pen and puts in his field the way people normally spread manure.One may not open a quarry for the first time (during shvi’it) in his field, until it has three layers, three amot by three amot by three amot high, their measure is twenty-seven stones.A fence that has ten stones each able to support two people, these may be removed.  The measurement of a wall is ten tfachim.  If it’s less than that, he cuts it and can level it until it’s under a tefach.  What is this talking about?  When it’s his, but if it’s his friend’s, he can remove whatever he wants.  What is this talking about?  If he did not start from erev shvi’it, but if he did, he can remove whatever (of his wall) he wants.Stones which the plow forced up, or which had been covered but were uncovered, if there are two which each can support two people, these he may remove.  One who clears stones from his field, he may take the upper stones, but not those which touch the ground.  So too with a heap of pebbles or a stack of stones, he may take the top but leaves those which touch the earth.  If there is rocky ground or straw underneath, he may take them.One may not build steps by ravines erev shvi’it after the rains stop, because he is fixing things for shvi’it.  But on may build them during shvi’it after the rain has stopped, because he is fixing for motzei shvi’it.  But he may not cement the stones with earth, but he may make a loose pile.  Any stone he can take with his hand (while in his field) he may take.Stones so heavy they must be carried on the shoulders may be taken from anywhere.  And a contractor may take (even smaller shoulder stones) from anywhere.  What exactly are shoulder stones?  Anything one cannot take with one hand, according to Rabi Meir.  Rabi Yossi says, shoulder stones are like their name, they have to be taken two or three on the shoulder.One who builds a fence between himself and the public domain may dig down to rock.  What does he do with the earth?  He heaps it up in the public domain and then fixes it (flat), according to Rabi Yehoshua.  Rabi Akiva says, Justas one may not damage the public domain, one may not fix in it.  So what does he do with the earth?  He piles it in his field like one who piles manure.  So too with one who digs a whole, a trench, or a cave.At first they said, one may gather wood, stones, and grass from his own property just as he can gather from his friend’s property, large pieces (clearly needed, not to tend the field).  When many people would sin they instituted that one should gather from the field of the other, not as a favor (a mutual partnership), and needless to say that it’s not to give food for a trade (to one who gathers things to improve his land).A field cleared of thorns may be planted motzei shvi’it.  If it was improved or used to let cows graze, it may not be planted motzei shvi’it.  A field that was improved, Beit Shamay says you may not eat its fruit during shvi’it and Beit Hillel allows it.  Beit Shamay said, one may not eat shvi’it fruit as a favor (from the owner, it’s hefker), and Beit Hillel says, you may eat as a favor or not.   Rabi Yehuda says, flip the opinions, this is a leniency of Beit Shamay and a stringency of Beit Hillel.One may rent freshly-plowed land from a non-Jew during shvi’it, but not from a Jew.  One may strengthen non-Jews during shvi’it (as in saying, good luck), but not Jews.  And one greets people, to keep the ways of peacefulness.One who thins out (clusters of) olive trees, Beit Shamay says, he cuts only to the roots, and Beit Hillel says, he may pull out the roots as well (this is not tending).  What is thinning?  One or two trees.  Leveling?  Three, one next to the other.  What is this talking about?  In his field, but in his friend’s, even if he levels, he can uproot.One who cuts wood off an olive tree may not cover it with earth, but covers it with stones or straw.  One who cuts the branches of a sycamore may not cover it in earth, but can cover it with stones or straw.  One may not cut a previously uncut sycamore, because it is considered work (it improves the tree).  Rabi Yehuda says, the normal way of cutting is assur, unless he cuts ten tfachim up or to the roots.One who clips grapes or cuts reeds, Rabi Yossi Hagelili says he must keep a tefach from the ground.  Rabi Akiva says, he can cut as usual, with an ax, a sickle, a saw, or anything he wants.  A tree which split may be tied during shvi’it, not such that it will heal, but rather that it won’t continue to split.From when can you eat the fruit of a tree in shvi’it?  The unripe ones, when they glisten, you can eat them with your bread out in the field.  The ripe ones, you may bring into your house.  So too in the rest of the years in the cycle pertaining to when he has to take ma’aser.Unripe grapes, from when they produce liquid he can eat them with his bread in the field.  Once they have ripened, he may take them into his house.  And so too in the rest of the years of the cycle pertaining to when he has to take ma’asrot.Olives, once they yield a revi’it to the se’ah, he may crush them and eat in the field.  When they produce half a log, he may press and use for skin in the field.  When they yield a third, they may be pressed in the field and taken into his house.  And so too in the rest of the years of the cycle pertaining to when he has to take ma’asrot.  And the rest of the fruits of the tree, their season for ma’aser is the same as their season for shvi’it.From when is it forbidden to cut down trees in shvi’it?  Beit Shamay says, all trees when they bring forth leaves.  Beit Hillel says, carobs from when they droop, grapes from when they produce ‘kernels’, olives from when they blossom, and all other trees from when they produce leaves.  And all trees, when they come to the time of ma’asrot, one may cut them down.  How much can be on an olive before it can be cut?  A rova.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, it all depends on the olive tree.White figs, shvi’it also applies in the second year of the cycle, since they only produce every three years.  Rabi Yehuda says, Persian figs, their shvi’it is motzei shvi’it, since they only produce every two years.  They said to him, it only applies to whit figs.One who buries luf (an onion-like plant) during shvi’it (to preserve it), Rabi Meir says not less than two se’ah, it has to be up to three tfachim, and no less than a tefach of dirt on top.  Chachamim say, no less than twelve kav (one third of Rabi Meir) and up to and covered with one tefach.  And you bury it in a place people step.Luf which has remained through shvi’it, Rabi Eliezer says, if the poor picked its leaves, they picked them.  If they haven’t he must settle by giving to the poor.  Rabi Yehoshua says, if the poor picked, they picked, and if not, they don’t have a settlement.Luf from erev shvi’it which entered shvi’it, and so too with onions, spring onions, and dyestuff from choice land, Beit Shamay says, you uproot it with wooden rakes.  Beit Hillel says, with metal spades.  But they agree by dyestuffs with lateral roots can be uprooted with metal spades.From when can one pick luf on motzei shvi’it?  Rabi Yehuda says, immediately.  Chachamim say, once the new crop comes in.These are tools which an artisan may not sell in shvi’it (that he suspects will be using them), a plow and its tools, a yoke, a winnow-fork, and a weeding-fork.  But he can sell a hand-sickle, a scythe, and a cart and all its tools.  This is the general rule, all tools which have specialized usage for a transgression, are assur, but those used for both transgressions and allowed work may be sold.A potter may sell five oil jugs and fifteen wine jugs, for one usually takes this much from hefker.  If one bought more than this, it’s mutar.  And he may sell to a non-Jew in Israel and a Jew outside of Israel.Beit Shamay says, one may not sell a plowing cow during shvi’it.  Beit Hillel allows it, for he can shecht it.  One may sell him produce even when it’s time to sow (we assume he’ll eat it), lend him a se’ah measure even though one knows he has a threshing floor (we assume he’s measuring a small amount to be threshed), and change money even though on knows he has workers (we assume he’s covering mutar expenses).  But if he expresses any forbidden need, it is assur.A woman may lend her friend who is suspect by shvi’it a sifter, a sieve, a hand-mill, or an oven.  But she may not sift or grind with her.  The wife of a chaver may lend to the wife of an am ha’aretz a sifter or a sieve, and she may separate, grind, or sift with her, but once she has poured water, she can’t touch it, for you don’t help those who are engaged in transgression.  And this was all said because of the ways peacefulness.  One may encourage non-Jews on shvi’it (as in, say good luck), but not a Jew.  And you greet people, out of the ways of peacefulness.There are three lands to which shvi’it apply, all the land that those who returned from Bavel had, from Israel until Kziv, can’t be eaten from or worked.  All that those who returned from Egypt had, from Kziv until the river until Amana, can be eaten, but can’t be worked.  And from the river and from Amana inward, can be eaten and worked.In Syria, one may work the produce that is detached from the ground, but not that which is attached.  One may thresh, winnow, stomp grapes, and bundle, but not harvest, gather grapes, or pick olives.  Rabi Akiva gives a general rule, anything which is allowed in Israel is allowed in Syria.Onions which had rain water and sprouted, if their leaves are black (fresh and therefore shvi’it), they are assur.  If they become green, these are allowed.  Rabi Chanina ben Antigonus says, if they can be pulled out by their leaves, they are assur, like this during motzei shvi’it, they are mutar.From when may a person take vegetables on motzei shvi’it?  Once one of the same species has ripened.  If a place which ripens early has ripened, one may eat from that which ripens late.  Rabi allowed one to immediately take on motzei shvi’it.One does not remove oil that must be burned and the fruits of shvi’it from Israel.  Rabi Shimon said, I heard expressly that one may take to Syria, but not outside of Israel.There is an important principle they said about shvi’it, anything that is edible, fodder, dyestuff, and doesn’t stay good when left in the ground, it has the laws of shvi’it, and its proceeds hava the laws of shvi’it, it has to be burned after it is out of season (biur) as does its proceeds.  What are these?  Leaves of wild luf, mint leaves, chicory, leeks, portulac, and milkweed.  And fodder?  (Even to) thorns and thistles.  And dyestuff?  After-growth of woad and madder.  They and their proceeds have the laws of shvi’it and biur.And they said another principle, whatever isn’t edible, fodder, dyestuff, and does keep when left in the ground, it as the laws of shvi’it as does its proceeds, but neither it nor its proceeds has biur.  What are these? The roots of wild luf, mint roots, hart’s tongue, milkweed root, and hazelwort.  And dyestuff?  Dyer’s madder and sowbread, the laws of shvi’it as does its proceeds, but neither it nor its proceeds has biur.  Rabi Meir says, its proceeds have biur until Rosh Hashana.  They said to him, they don’t have biur, so their proceeds obviously don’t have biur.Peels of pomegranates and their blossoms and shells of nuts and their kernels have the laws of shvi’it, as do their proceeds.  The dyer may dye for his needs, but not for a pay, for you can’t trade with produce of shvi’it, and not with first-born animals (bechor), truma, an animal that died of natural causes, torn flesh, sheketz, or remes.  And one may not take produce from a field and sell it in the market, but he can harvest and have his son sell on his behalf.  If he took for himself and some happened to be left over, he may sell it.One bought a bechor for his son’s wedding or the festival, and didn’t end up needing it, he may sell it.  Hunters of wild animals, fowl, and fish, when they happen upon tame species, they may sell them.  Rabi Yehuda says, even anyone who randomly found these may sell, as long as this isn’t his trade.  And Chachamim forbid it.Fronds of the service-tree and carobs have the laws of shvi’it, as do their proceeds, and they and their proceeds have biur.  Fronds of terebinth, pistachio, and white thorn have the laws of shvi’it, as do their proceeds, but neither they nor their proceeds has biur, but the leaves do have biur, because they fall off the stem.The rose, cypress, balsam, and lotus have shvi’it, as do their proceeds.  Rabi Shimon says, balsam doesn’t have shvi’it, because it’s not a fruit (it’s a resin).A new rose that has been preserved in old oil (during shvi’it), the rose may be taken out (and the oil is not subject to biur).  If it’s an old rose in new oil (during motzei shvi’it), it is chayav in biur.  New carobs preserved in old wine and old in new are chayav by biur.  This is the general rule, anything which gives flavor, one has to do biur if the thing is not in its own type (and got flavor).  If it is the same type (e.g. shvi’it oil in old oil), any amount makes it chayav biur.  Shvi’it forbids anything of the same type, but for different types, only something which imparts flavor.There is an important principle they said about shvi’it, anything designated as human food, one does not make clotters out of it, or needless to say, for animals.  Whatever is not designated as human food, one may make a clotter out of it, but not for animals.  And anything which is not designated for human food or fodder is thought of as human and animal food, and gets the same stringencies.  If he intended to use it as wood, it is wood, like savory, hyssop, and thyme.Shvi’it can be given for food, drink, or salve.  To eat what is normally eaten, and to make a salve from what is normally made into a salve.  One may not make wine or vinegar into a salve, but one use oil.  So too with truma and ma’aser sheni.  Shvi’it is even less stringent, because you can use oil to light candles.One may not sell shvi’it produce by measure, weight, or number, nor figs by number, nor vegetables by weight.  Beit Shamay says, also not in bundles.  Beit Hillel says, things that are usually bundled at home, one my bundle at the shuk, as in leeks and milkweed.One who says to a laborer, here is an issar (an amount of money), collect vegetables for me today, he may hire him.  If he said, collect vegetables for me on account of this money, he may not hire him.  If one took a loaf from a baker worth a pundyon and said, when I have gathered vegetables of the field I’ll bring them for you, it’s mutar.  If he just took from him, he may not pay from the proceeds of shvi’it, for one doesn’t fulfill a debt with shvi’it funds.One may not give (proceeds of shvi’it as payment) to a well-digger, a bath attendant, a barber, or a sailor, but you may give to the digger of a well used for drinking.  And he can give to them all as a free gift.Figs of shvi’it, one may not lay them out on a drying floor, but one may lay them out on an empty site.  One may not stomp on grapes in a winepress, but one may stomp in a kneading-though.  And one may not process olives in an olive press or crusher, but he may crush them and put them in a small press.  Rabi Shimon says, he may even grind them in an olive press and put them in a small olive press.One may not cook shvi’it produce in truma oil, so that it won’t come to be pasul.  Rabi Shimon allows it.  The last thing in a string of trades gets the shvi’it requirements, and the produce itself (that was from shvi’it) is assur.One may not buy slaves, land, or non-kosher animals with shvi’it proceeds, but if he did, he must buy food of equal value and treat it as shvi’it.  One may not bring a bird offering as a zav, zava, or child-bearer using proceeds of shvi’it, but if they took he buys food of equal value and treats it as shvi’it.  One may not oil vessels with oil of shvi’it, but if he did, he buys food of equal value and treats it as shvi’it.Leather that has been oiled with shvi’it oil, Rabi Eliezer says burn it, Chachamim say, he buys food of equal value and treats it as shvi’it.  They said before Rabi Akiva, Rabi Eliezer used to say, leather that has been burned with shvi’it oil must be burned.  He said to them, be quiet!  I won’t tell you what Rabi Eliezer said about this.They also said before him, Rabi Eliezer used to say, one who eats the bread of cutim is as if he ate pork.  He said to them, be quiet!  I won’t tell you what Rabi Eliezer said about this.Yud Bath water that has been warmed using hay or straw of shvi’it, one is allowed to wash in it.  But if he is a distinguished person, he won’t bathe in it.Rue, goosefoot, purslane, hill coriander, water-parsley, and meadow berries are exempt from ma’aser, and may be bought from anyone during shvi’it, because nothing like them is watched.  Rabi Yehuda says, randomly grown mustard is allowed, for we don’t suspect they will have been tended.  Rabi Shimon says, all randomly grown plants are allowed, except for those of cabbage, for there is nothing wild like them.  Chachamim say, all randomly grown things are assur.Three different lands have Judea, Transjordan, and the Galil (Galilee), and each of these is three lands.  The upper Galil, the lower Galil, and the valley.  Kfar Chanania and up, where no sycamores grow is the upper Galil.  Kfar Chanina and below, where one grows sycamores is the lower Galil.  The area around Teveria is the valley.  In Yehuda, the hill, the plain, and the valley.  And the plain of Lod is like the plain of the south, and its hill is like the hill of the king.  From Beit Choron until the sea, this is one region.Why did they make three lands?  So you could eat in each land until the last of that land is eaten (and then do biur).  Rabi Shimon says, they only made three lands in Judea, and the rest is like the king’s mountain.  And all of the land is one for olives and dates.One may still eat what can be found as hefker, but not on that which is protected from animals.  Rabi Yossi allows (delaying biur) even based on the protected.  One may eat based on the vetchling (degenerate crop which will last in the field) and the tree which blooms twice a season, but not on (inferior) autumn grapes.  Rabi Yehuda allows (grapes) from whenever they ripened before the end of summer.One preserves three ‘pickles’ in one barrel, Rabi Eliezer says, you eat based on the earliest.  Rabi Yehoshua says, even on the latest.  Raban Gamliel says, whatever is finished in the field has to have biur from that barrel, and the halacha is like him.  Rabi Shimon says, all types of vegetables are like one when it comes to biur.  One can eat portulac until vetches have finished from the Beit Netofa valley.One who gathers fresh herbs (may eat them) until the groundwater dries.  One who gathers dry (may eat) until the second rain.  Reed leaves and grape leaves, until they fall from their stems.  One who gathers them dry, until the second rain.  Rabi Akiva says, all of them until the second rain falls.Likewise, one who rents his friend’s house until the rain comes has until the second rain.  One who has a vow against taking benefit from his friend until the rains, it lasts until the second rain.  Until when may the poor enter orchards?  Until the second rain.  From when may one use or burn hay or straw of shvi’it?  From the second rain.One who had shvi’it produce, and it came time for biur, he allots the food for three meals.  The poor can eat after biur, but not the rich, according to Rabi Yehuda.  Rabi Yossi says, both rich and poor may eat after biur.One who had produce of shvi’it which he inherited or received as a gift, Rabi Eliezer says, he shall give it to whoever will eat it.  Chachamim say, a sinner doesn’t benefit, rather he will sell it to those who will eat it, and the money he will give to anyone.  One who eats dough from shvi’it before challa was taken is chayav to be killed."
