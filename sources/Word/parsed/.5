        "Mesechet Lists some species we are lenient about dmai with, including wild figs, jujube fruit, and sycamore fruit, and there are some others in Judea.  Rabi Yehuda says all wild figs are exempt except for a type of fig that bears fruit semiannually, all jujube fruits except those from Shikmona, and all young sycamore fruit except those which burst.Dmai isn’t subject to chomesh or biur on Pesach, an onen, one who has not yet buried his dead, can eat it, can enter and leave Yerushalayim, you can leave a bit of it on the road, you can feed it to an am ha’aretz, but you have to eat an equivalent amount of your ma’aser sheni, you can de-sanctify redeemed dmai by exchanging silver for silver, copper for copper, silver for copper, or copper for fruit, according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say you have to take the fruit to Yerushalayim.One who takes to seed of as feed, flour for hides, oil for a candle, or oil to grease tools, is patur if it’s dmai.  Kziv or north, it’s not considered Israel, so it’s patur on dmai.  Challa from an am ha’aretz, mixed truma and non-truma, food bought with ma’aser sheni money, and leftovers from a korban mincha are patur from dmai.  Perfumed oil, Beit Shamay says it’s chayav dmai, and Beit Hillel says it’s patur.Dmai can be used for an eruv, to join courtyards (such that things may be carried between them), to bench, to make a zimun, can be separated in the nude (since taking ma’aser from it doesn’t need a bracha), and can be separated at dusk.  If you take ma’aser sheni before ma’aser rishon, it doesn’t matter.  Oil which a weaver rubs between his fingers is chayav in dmai, but what the wool-comber puts on the wool is patur in dmai.Lists some things which when dmai have to have ma’aser taken, including rice.  But rice outside of Israel, whoever uses it is patur from ma’aser.One who takes it upon himself to be ne’eman takes ma’aser on what he eats, what he sells, what he buys, and doesn’t stay by an am ha’aretz.  Rabi Yehuda says, even one who stays by an am ha’aretz is a ne’eman.  They said to him, if the person (the host) isn’t ne’eman for himself, why do you think they will be ne’eman for others?One who takes it upon himself to be a chaver doesn’t sell to an am ha’aretz dry or moist, and doesn’t buy from him moist, and doesn’t stay by an am ha’aretz, and doesn’t have amei ha’aretz over in his own clothes.  Rabi Yehuda says, he doesn’t breed small cattle, take vows often, joke often, does net get tumat met, and becomes a shamash in the beit midrash.  They said to him, yours are not required.The Chachamim didn’t require bakers to separate anything other than challa and trumat ma’aser.  Storekeepers may not sell dmai.  Wholesalers can sell dmai.  Who is considered a wholesaler?  Recognized wholesalers and grain sellers.Rabi Meir says, one who normally wholesales but sold in small quantity, it goes under his wholesaler status, an ordinary salesman who sold wholesale, it goes under his salesman status.  How big is wholesale?  Dry things is three kav, and moist things worth a dinar.  Rabi Yossi says, baskets of figs, baskets of dates, and boxes of vegetables, as long as they are sold as a lot, they are patur.One may feed the poor and quartered troops dmai.  Raban Gamliel would feed his workers dmai.  People who collect tzedaka, Beit Shamay said you would give me’usar food to those who don’t take ma’aser, and non-me’usar food to those who take ma’aser, therefore everyone will eat ma’aser-ed food.  Chachamim say you collect anything and distribute anything, those who want to take ma’aser will.One who wants to cut off the undesirable tops of a tuber vegetable to lighten his load cannot throw it out until it’s me’usar.  One who buys vegetables at the shuk and wants to return it cannot return it until he takes ma’aser, for the only thing he didn’t do was count his bundles, i.e. they were his and he needed to take ma’aser.  If one was about to buy, but saw some better produce, you can return without ma’aser, since you didn’t acquire it.If one finds fruit on the road and he takes it to eat it, but decides to save it, he may not save it until he takes ma’aser.  But if he took it so it wouldn’t get lost (not to eat) he’s patur from ma’aser.  Anything which one can’t sell as dmai, one can’t give to his friend if it’s dmai.  Rabi Yossi allows it when it is certainly not me’usar, as long as he knows that it’s not.If one brings wheat to a kuti or an am ha’aretz miller, its status of ma’asrot and shmitot is assumed unchanged.  If one brings to a non-Jewish miller, it’s dmai.  Same with depositing fruit by someone, except the non-Jew’s is considered tevel.  Rabi Shimon says it’s only dmai.One who gives an innkeeper, takes ma’aser from what he gives and what he gets, because we suspect she might exchange produce.  Rabi Yossi says, we are not accountable for deceivers, you only take ma’aser on what you get from her.One who gives his mother-in-law, he takes ma’aser from what he gives and gets, because we suspect she will switch it if it burns.  Rabi Yehuda says, she wants her daughter to be favorable and is embarrassed in front of her son-in-law.  Rabi Yehuda admits that if he gives food which is shvi’it she is not suspected of switching, because she would not feed her daughter any inappropriate shvi’it.One who bought from a person who isn’t ne’eman, forgot to take ma’aser, and asked the seller on Shabbat may trust the seller.  Once it’s motzei Shabbat, he can’t eat until he takes ma’aser.  If he can’t find the seller, any non-ne’eman can tell him they are me’usar and he can eat them, but only on Shabbat.  Trumat ma’aser that became mixed in, Rabi Shimon Shezuri says, even during the week we will believe the seller if he says he had already taken trumat ma’aser.If one makes a vow that his friend will be barred from his things if the friend doesn’t eat a meal with him, and the friend doesn’t trust him by ma’asrot, the friend may eat with him the first Shabbat if he says it’s me’usar, even if the friend doesn’t trust him.  But on the second Shabbat, even though there’s an issur hanaya, the friend can only eat if he takes ma’aser.Rabi Eliezer says, one does not need to take ma’aser ani from dmai.  Chachamim say, he designates some as ma’aser ani, but he doesn’t need to separate it.One who designated trumat ma’aser of dmai or ma’aser ani of tevel will not separate it no Shabbat.  And if a kohen or a poor person would normally come to him, he can give them that, as long as he informs them that it’s actually their food.One who says to a non-ne’eman to buy for him from a ne’eman, the non-ne’eman isn’t trusted.  If he said a certain person, we trust the messenger.  If the messenger said, I couldn’t find the person, so I bought from some other ne’eman, we don’t believe him.One who enters a city and knows nobody there, and asks who is a ne’eman.  If the resident says, I am, we don’t believe him.  If he says a certain person is, we believe him.  If he goes to the specified person and asks, who sells dry grain, and the seller says the person who sent you, even though they seem to be in cahoots we trust them.Donkey drivers (who sell produce) who entered a city, one said, mine is new but my friend’s is old, but mine is me’usar and my friend’s isn’t, we don’t believe him.  Rabi Yehuda says we do."
