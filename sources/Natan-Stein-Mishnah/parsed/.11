        "Mesechet Five people don’t take truma, and if they did, their truma isn’t truma, the deaf-mute, mentally infirm, minor, one who takes truma from what isn’t his, and a non-Jew who took from that of a Jew, even with permission, is not truma.A deaf person who can speak, but not hear will not give, but if he gave, it is truma.  When Chachamim normally talk about a cheresh it is one who can’t hear or speak.A minor who doesn’t yet have two hairs, Rabi Yehuda says, his truma is truma.  Rabi Yossi says, if he hasn’t reached the age of vows (twelve) his truma isn’t truma.  Once he has reached the age of vows, his truma is truma.One may not take truma from olives for oil, and not from grapes for wine.  If they did separate, Beit Shamay says, only that which was taken for the fruit is truma, and Beit Hillel says, the truma isn’t truma.One may not take truma from leket, shichicha, pe’ah, hefker, ma’aser rishon that has had truma taken, ma’aser sheni or hekdesh that has been redeemed, the chayav on the patur, the patur on the chayav, the harvested for the unharvested, the unharvested on the harvested, the new (from this year) on the old (from last year), the old on the new, from Israeli produce for non-Israeli produce, and not from non-Israeli produce on Israeli produce.  If one took these trumot, his truma isn’t truma.Five types of people should not take truma, but if they did, their truma is truma.  The mute, drunk, (currently) naked, blind, and bal keri shouldn’t take truma, but if they did, their truma is truma.One doesn’t take truma by measure, weight, or number, but one takes truma from what has been measured, weighed, or counted.  One does not take truma by a basket or hamper of a set size, but he may fill them half or a third of their size (to show he is only holding the truma, not measuring).  One may not take truma as half of a se’ah measure, for that is a measure itself.One doesn’t fake truma from olives which are going to be crushed or from grapes which are going to be stomped.  If he did, his truma is truma, but he must go back and take again.  If the first becomes mixed with chulin (and makes it like truma) by itself, so one who eats from it owes chomesh (a fifth extra), but not the second.One may take truma from oil for olives to be crushed and from wine for grapes to be stomped.  If one took from oil for olives to be eaten, olives from olives to be eaten, wine on grapes for eating, or grapes on grapes for eating, and then he decided to process and not eat, he need not take more truma.One may not take truma from a finished product for an unfinished product, not from an unfinished product for a finished product, and not from an unfinished product on an unfinished product.  But if he took, his truma is truma.One may not take truma from pure on impure, but if you did, it’s truma.  They really said, if a dried-fig-cake had a part which became tame, you may take from the tahor for the tame.  So too on a bundle of vegetables or a heap.  If there were two cakes, bundles, or heaps, one tame and one tahor, he may not take from this on that.  Rabi Eliezer says, you may take from the tahor on the tame.One may not take from the tame on the tahor, if he did accidentally, it’s truma, but if he did intentionally, it’s not.  So to with a Levi who had ma’aser tevel (trumat ma’aser hadn’t been taken) if he separates and goes along receiving (based on his original separation), accidentally, what he did is done, intentionally, he did nothing.  Rabi Yehuda says, if he knew about this before hand, even if he did it accidentally, he did nothing.One who immerses utensils on Shabbat, if it was accidentally, he may use them, if intentionally he may not.  One who takes ma’aser or cooks on Shabbat, if it’s an accident, he may eat, but if he did it intentionally, he may not eat.  If he plants a tree on Shabbat, accidentally he may leave it, if intentionally, he must uproot it.  But if it’s shvi’it, whether accidentally or intentionally, he must uproot.One may not take from one species for a different species, and if he took, his truma isn’t truma.  All types of wheat are one.  All types of figs, dried figs, and fig cake count as one, and he may take from one on the other.  Wherever there is a kohen, he takes from the choice (fresh), but wherever there is no kohen, he must take from what keeps best.  Rabi Yehuda says, he always takes from the choice.One should take a whole, small onion rather than half of a large onion (it keeps better).  Rabi Yehuda says, no, rather half the large onion (it is choice).  And such Rabi Yehuda would say, one may take from town onions on village ones, but not from village on town, for the town onions are food of the upper class.One may take from oil-olives for pickle-olives, but not vice versa, and non-cooked wine on cooked, but not vice versa.  This is the general rule, anything which is kilayim together can’t have truma taken from one on the other, even the choice on the inferior.  But everything which isn’t kilayim, one may take from the choice on the inferior, but not vice versa.  But if he took from the inferior on the choice, it is truma, except for darnel on wheat, for it’s not food.  And squash and cucumber are one type.  Rabi Yehuda says, two.If one took a squash for truma and he found it was bitter (and possibly not fit for food) or a watermelon and he found it was rotten, it is truma, but he must take again.  He took a barrel of wine and it was found to be vinegar, if it is known that it was vinegar before it was taken, it’s not truma, if it’s known to be after he gave it is truma, if it’s unsure, it is truma, but he must take again.  The first doesn’t make meduma (a mixture with chulin) on its own, and one doesn’t owe chomesh if he ate from it, and so too with the second.One of them fell into chulin, it doesn’t make meduma, or if the second fell into the place of the first, it doesn’t make meduma.  If they both fell into the same place, it makes meduma according to the smaller of the two.Partners who took truma one after another, Rabi Akiva says, their trumot are both truma.  Chachamim say, only the first’s is truma.  Rabi Yossi says, if the first took according to the proper measure, the second’s isn’t truma.  If the first didn’t take the full amount, the second’s is truma.What is this (Rabi Akiva’s opinion) talking about?  If they didn’t speak (to each other).  But if he gave permission to a family member, his slave, or his maidservant to take, their truma is truma.  If he annulled, if he annulled before they took, the truma isn’t truma.  But if it was after they took, the truma is truma.  Workers don’t have a right to take, except for wine stompers, for they would impurify the winepress immediately (if they didn’t take truma).One who says, the truma of this heap is within it, the ma’asrot are within it, and trumat ma’aser is within it, Rabi Shimon says, he declared it.  Chachamim say, he only declares it when he specifies a place.  Rabi Elazar Chisma says, one who says, the truma of the heap, from it, is on it, declared it.  Rabi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says, one who says, a tenth of ma’aser is made trumat ma’aser for it (even within the heap), he declared it.One who takes truma before bikurim, ma’aser rishon before truma, or ma’aser sheni before ma’aser rishon, even though he is transgressing a lo ta’ase, what is done is done, as it says, “you shall not delay from your abundance and liquor.”How do we know that you should take bikurim before truma?  This called truma and reshit, and that is called truma and reshit!  Rather, bikurim come first, for they are the first fruits of everything (truma is only from what is harvested), truma before ma’aser rishon, for it is called reshit, and ma’aser rishon before sheni for it contains reshit.One who meant to say truma but said ma’aser, meant ma’aser but said truma, meant olah but said shlamim, meant shlamim but said olah, meant I will not enter this one’s house but said (enter) that one, or meant I won’t derive benefit from this one but said (from) that one, he didn’t say anything, until his mouth and his heart agree.A non-Jew and a kuti, their truma is truma, their ma’aser is ma’aser, and their hekdesh is hekdesh.  Rabi Yehuda says, a non-Jew has no rule for a fourth year vineyard, but Chachamim say he does.  The truma of a non-Jew makes meduma, and makes it chayav on a chomesh, but Rabi Shimon says it’s patur.If one took part of truma and ma’asrot, he may take from that (heap) truma for it, but not for another place.  Rabi Meir says, he may even take from it for trumot and ma’asrot for another place.One who had his produce in a storehouse, and he gave a se’ah to a levi and a se’ah to a poor person, he may take another eight se’ah (which are now chulin) and eat them according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say, he may not take except for the exact amount (left, for if the trumot and ma’asrot have been eaten he can’t take the full amount).The amount that is taken for truma, a generous person, one in forty.  Beit Shamay says, one in thirty.  The average, (one) from fifty, and the stingy (one) from sixty.  If he separated and found it to be one in sixty, it is truma, but he should go back and separate until it is as he normally takes, in the measure, weight, and number.  Rabi Yehuda says, it can even be from one isn’t close by.One who says to his messenger, go and take truma, he takes according to the opinion of the owner.  If he doesn’t know the opinion of the owner, he takes as an average person, one in fifty.  If he lowered by ten or added ten, his truma is truma.  If he intended to add even one, it is not truma.One who wishes to give more truma, Rabi Eliezer says, one tenth is the maximum, like trumat ma’aser.  If he took more than this, he should take trumat ma’aser on another place too.  Rabi Yishma’el says, half of it is truma and half is chulin.  Rabi Tarfon and Rabi Akiva say, as long as some chulin is left (he may take all he wants).Three times one measures his baskets, for the first ripe fruits, the last summer fruits, and the middle of the summer.  One who counts is praiseworthy, one who measures is even more praiseworthy, and one who weighs is the most praiseworthy.Rabi Eliezer says, truma is nullified by one hundred to one.  Rabi Yehoshua says, in a hundred plus, and for the ‘plus’ there is no (set) measure.  Rabi Yossi ben Meshulam says, ‘plus’ is a kav per hundred se’ah, (‘plus’) is one sixth of what makes meduma.Rabi Yehoshua says, black figs annul white ones (combine to help annul a mixture of meduma), white ones annul for the black ones, by pressed fig cakes, large annul the small and small annul the large, cakes annul the white ones, and the white ones annul cakes.  Rabi Eliezer makes this assur.  Rabi Akiva says, if you know what fell, they don’t help annul, but if you don’t know, they do help annul.When?  Fifty black figs and fifty white, if a black one fell in, the black are assur and the white are mutar, if a white one fell, the white are assur and the black are mutar.  If you don’t know what fell, one helps annul the other.  And in this Rabi Eliezer is strict, and Rabi Yehoshua is lenient.And in this Rabi Eliezer is lenient and Rabi Yehoshua is strict, one who pressed a litra (a measurement) of dried figs on the mouth of a jug (filled with a hundred litra of figs), and he doesn’t know which it is (tevel or chulin dried figs), Rabi Eliezer says, we see them as if they are separate (as in they scattered amongst each other), and the ones one the bottom annul the ones on the top, but Rabi Yehoshua says, it isn’t considered as rising up until there are one hundred jars there.Yud A se’ah of truma which fell onto a stored pile and skimmed off the top layer.  Rabi Eliezer said, if the skimmed off portion is one hundred se’ah, it becomes annulled in one hundred one.  Rabi Yehoshua says, it won’t annul.  A se’ah of truma which fell on a stored pile, he must skim it odd.  If so, why did they say truma is nullified in one hundred one?  If he doesn’t know if they mixed, or where it fell.Yud Two baskets or two piles into one of which a se’ah of truma fell and it’s not know into which one, they annul one another.  Rabi Shimon says, even if they are in two towns they combine.Yud Rabi Yossi said, once a case came before Rabi Akiva where fifty bundles of vegetables into which one fell which was half truma, and I said before hum, it is annulled, not that fifty-one annulled, but rather that there were one hundred two halves there.A se’ah or tame truma that fell into less than one hundred (se’ah) of chulin, into ma’aser rishon, into ma’aser sheni, or into hekdesh, whether tame or tahor, they are left to rot.  If the one se’ah was tahor, they sell it to the kohanim at the price of truma, minus the price of the one se’ah.  If it fell into ma’aser rishon, he designates trumat ma’aser (and distributes accordingly).  If it fell into ma’aser sheni or hekdesh, these must simply be redeemed.  If the chulin were tame, it may be eaten in small cakes, roasted, kneaded with fruit juice, or split between doughs such that no dough contains more than a kbeitza.A se’ah of tame truma that fell into one hundred (se’ah) of tahor chulin, Rabi Eliezer says, he takes truma and (the kohen must burn it, for I say, a se’ah that fell is a se’ah which was taken up (removed for truma).  Chachamim say, it is nullified, and it can be eaten in small cakes, roasted, kneaded with fruit juice, or divided between doughs, such that no dough contains more than a kbeitza.A se’ah of tahor truma that fell into one hundred (se’ah) of tame chulin, it is nullified, and can be eaten as small cakes, roasted, kneaded with fruit juice, or divided between doughs, such that no dough has more than a kbeitza.A se’ah of tame truma that fell into one hundred se’ah of tahor truma, Beit Shamay prohibits it, and bet Hillel allow it.  Beit Hillel said to Beit Shamay, since the tahor is assur to zarim and the tame is assur to kohanim, just as the tahor is nullified (when in chulin), so too the tame should be nullified.  Beit Shamay said, no, if chulin, which is treated leniently and is allowed to zarim nullifies the tahor, should the truma, which is treated strictly and is not allowed to zarim nullify the tame?  After they (Beit Shamay) admitted (that Beit Hillel was right), Rabi Eliezer says, he must take truma and (have the kohen) burn it.  And the Chachamim say, it is lost because it is so small.A se’ah of truma that fell into one hundred (se’ah of chulin) which he lifted out but it fell into another place, Rabi Eliezer says, it makes meduma just as definite truma.  Chachamim say, it doesn’t make meduma, only as much as proportional in the removed se’ah (the part of the whole which was truma).A se’ah of truma which fell into less than a hundred (se’ah of chulin), and part of the mixture fell into another place, Rabi Meir says, it makes meduma as if it were certainly truma, and Chachamim say it only makes meduma proportional to what made up the original meduma, leavened (dough, which was meduma) only makes meduma on leavened proportionally, and drawn water is pasul a mikva only proportionally (only if the drawn water was added in large enough portions, if not, it  does not combine with drawn water already in the mikva.)A se’ah of truma which fell into one hundred (se’ah of chulin), he picked it up and it fell into another, and he picked that up again and if fell into another, behold this is mutar until there is more truma than chulin (in the first bunch).A se’ah of truma which fell into one hundred (se’ah of chulin), and he didn’t pick it up before another se’ah fell in, is assur.  Rabi Shimon allows it.A se’ah of truma that fell into a hundred (se’ah of chulin), and he ground and they became less, just as the chulin became less, so too the truma became less, and it is mutar.  A se’ah or truma which fell into less than one hundred (se’ah or chulin), and he ground it and it became more, just as the chulin increased the truma increased, so it is assur.  If he knows the chulin is of superior quality than the truma, it’s mutar.  A se’ah of truma that fell into less than a hundred (se’ah of chulin), and afterwards more chulin fell in, if it was by accident, it’s mutar, but if intentionally, it’s assur.One who accidentally eats truma pays the principal value and adds chomesh (one fifth of the whole amount paid, or one quarter of the original value).  Whether he eats it, drinks it, anoints with it, whether tahor or tame truma, he pays a fifth (and if he accidentally eats that he also pays) a fifth of a fifth.  He doesn’t pay with truma, rather with tithed chulin, and they become truma.  And the restitution is truma also.  Even if the kohen wants to forgo it, he cannot forgo.The daughter of a yisra’el who ate truma and then married a kohen, if she ate truma the kohen hadn’t acquired, she pays the value and keeps the chomesh.  If he had acquired it, she pays the value to the owners and keeps the chomesh, as is said, one who accidentally eats truma pays the owners the principal and chomesh for whoever wants.One who feeds his workers and guests truma pays the principal and they pay chomesh according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say, they pay the principal and the chomesh, and he pays them the value of their meal.One who steals truma but didn’t eat it pays double the principal value (kefel).  If he ate it, he pays double the principal and chomesh, one principal and chomesh from chulin and one principal from truma.  One who stole truma which a kohen made hekdesh pays two chumshim and one principal, for there is no kefel by hekdesh.One may not pay from leket, shichicha, pe’ah, hefker, ma’aser rishon that has had truma taken, or ma’aser sheni or hekdesh that have been redeemed, for hekdesh cannot redeem hekdesh, according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim allow these.Rabi Eliezer says, one may pay (back for truma) with one kind for another, as long as he pays from the superior on the inferior.  Rabi Akiva says, you may only pay for one kind with the same one, therefore, if he ate squash on erev shvi’it, he waits for squash of motzei shvi’it and pays from them.  From the same source that Rabi Eliezer is lenient Rabi Akiva is stringent, as it says, “and you shall give to the kohen that which is holy.”  Anything which is fit to become holy, according to Rabi Eliezer.  Rabi Akiva says from there, the holy thing which he ate.One who intentionally ate truma pays the principal but not the chomesh.  The repayment is in chulin.  If the kohen wants to forgo, he may.The daughter of a kohen who married a yisra’el and then ate truma, she pays the principal but not the chomesh, and her death is by burning (if she committed adultery).  If she married someone who is invalid (i.e. challa or mamzer) she pays principal and chomesh, and she will die by strangulation, according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say, both of these pay the principal but not chomesh, and die by burning.One who serves is little children and his slaves whether adults or minors, eats truma from outside of Israel, or eats less than a kzayit of truma, pays the principal but not the chomesh and the restitution is in chulin.  If the kohen wants to forgo, he may forgo.This is the general rule, anyone who pays principal and chomesh, the restitution is in truma.  If the kohen wants to forgo, he may not forgo.  And all who pay principal but not chomesh, the restitution is in chulin, and if the kohen wants to forgo, he may forgo.There were two baskets, one of truma and one of chulin, and a se’ah of truma fell into one of them, and it isn’t known into which of them, I can say, it fell into the truma.  If it’s not known which is truma and which is chulin, and he ate one of them, he’s patur.  The second, he treats it as truma and it’s chayav challa, according to Rabi Meir.  Rabi Yossi allows it.  If another person ate the second, he’s patur.  If one ate both of them, he pays according to the smaller of the baskets.If one of them (the baskets) fell into chulin, it doesn’t make meduma.  If the second does too, he treats it as truma and it’s chayav challa, according to Rabi Meir.  Rabi Yossi allows it.  If the second falls into a different place, it doesn’t make meduma.  If they both fell into one place, it makes meduma according to the smaller of them.If he sowed one of them, he’s patur, if he did the second also, he treats it as truma (he must plow it under or the produce will grow as truma) and it is chayav in challa, according to Rabi Meir.  And Rabi Yossi allows it.  If another person sowed the other, he’s patur.  If one person sowed them both, if it’s a type where the seed perishes (in the ground), it’s mutar, but a species where they don’t perish, it’s assur.A woman was eating truma, and people came and told her, your husband died, or, your husband divorced you, and so too a slave who was eating truma and they came and told him, your master died, he sold you to a yisra’el, he gave you as a gift, or, he made you a freedman, and so too with a kohen who was eating truma and he found out he’s the son of a divorcee or widow, Rabi Eliezer says they owe the principal and chomesh, and Rabi Yehoshua allows it.  If a kohen was standing and making an offering on the altar, and he finds out that he is the son of a divorcee or a widow, Rabi Eliezer says, all the offerings he made on the altar are invalid, and Rabi Yehoshua says they are valid.  If he (the kohen) found out that he had a blemish, they are invalid.And everyone who had truma in their mouth, Rabi Eliezer says, they swallow, and Rabi Yehoshua says, they must spit it out.  If they said to him, you were tame and the truma was tame, or he found that it is tevel, or ma’aser rishon that hasn’t had truma taken, or ma’aser sheni or hekdesh that wasn’t redeemed, or that he tasted the taste of a bug in his mouth, he must spit it out.One was eating a bunch of grapes (from the garden, before taking ma’aser), and he moved from the garden to the courtyard (meaning it is no longer random and he must take ma’aser), Rabi Eliezer says, he may finish it, and Rabi Yehoshua says, he may not finish it.Wine for truma that was found uncovered, he must spill it (even though it truma, it is not wasting for we fear it may have been tampered with).  And needless to say, this is the same if it is chulin.  Three drinks aren’t allowed once they are uncovered, water, wine, and milk.  All other drinks are allowed.  How much must they remain (uncovered) before they become assur (for fear of snake venom)?  Enough time for a reptile to come from close by and drink.The amount of water that may be uncovered, enough for the venom to be lost in it (sufficiently diluted).  Rabi Yossi says in vessels any amount, but on the ground, up to forty se’ah.Gnawed figs, grapes, squash, gourds, watermelons, or cucumbers, even if there is a kikar (a large measurement) of fruit on the tree all nibbled, whether the fruit is large or small, whether plucked or unplucked, if the fruit is moist, it’s assur (for fear of venom).  An animal bitten by a snake is assur (even if it doesn’t die that way) because it is dangerous to one’s life.A wine strainer becomes assur if uncovered, Rabi Nechemia allows wine strained through it.A barrel of truma that upon it arose a doubt of uncleanliness (through venom), Rabi Eliezer says, if it was placed in an exposed place, he should put it in a hidden place, and if it was uncovered, he should cover it (to protect the truma from becoming unclean).  Rabi Yehoshua says, if it was in a hidden place, he should put it in an exposed place, and if it was covered, he should uncover it (so it will definitely be unclean, and he may dispose of it).  Raban Gamliel says, he shouldn’t change anything about it.A barrel that broke in the upper part of a winepress (where grapes are pressed), and the bottom part (where the wine flows) contains tame wine, Rabi Eliezer and Rabi Yehoshua admit, if he can save a revi’it of the tahor, he should save it, but if not, Rabi Eliezer says, it should simply flow down and become tame, and not become tame by way of any action of his.So too with a barrel of oil which spilled , Rabi Eliezer and Rabi Yehoshua admit, if he can save a revi’it of the tahor, he should save it, and if not, Rabi Eliezer says, let if go and be absorbed (by the ground) and not become tame b way of any action of his.Yud On both of these Rabi Yehoshua says, this isn’t truma that I must be careful not to let become tame, rather which I cannot eat (and thus may become tame).  And what may I not let become tame?  He was traveling from place to place, and had loaves of truma in his hand, and a non-Jew said to him, give me one to make tame, and if not, I will make them all tame, Rabi Eliezer says, let him make them all tame, he shouldn’t give one over to be tame.  Rabi Yehoshua says, let him place one on a rock before him.Yud So too for women to whom non-Jews said, give us one of you and we will defile her, and if not we will defile all of you, let them all be defiled and let them not give over the soul of a Jew.One who sows truma (seed), if by accident, he must plow it under, if intentionally, he must let it grow (and it is truma).  If it reached a third of its growth, whether he planted it unintentionally or intentionally,  he must let it grow. And flax, even intentionally he must plow it under.And (planted truma) is chayav in leket, shichicha, and pe’ah, and the poor yisra’elim and kohanim ay glean, and the poor yisra’elim sell theirs to kohanim for the price of truma and the money is for them.  Rabi Tarfon says, only the poor kohanim may take, lest the yisra’elim forget and eat it.  Rabi Akiva said to him, if so, only tahor kohanim may take.And it (the sown truma) is chayav in ma’asrot and ma’aser ani, and poor yisra’elim and kohanim take, and the poor yisra’elim sell to kohanim for the price of truma, and the money is for them.  One who flails the truma plants by hand is praiseworthy (because the animals may not eat it, so he must muzzle them, which is assur).  How does he thresh them (with animals)?  He hangs baskets around the necks of the animals, and puts into them from the same type of food, so he doesn’t muzzle the animal and he doesn’t feed it truma.The growth of truma is truma, but the growth of that growth is chulin.  But tevel, ma’aser rishon, weeds from shvi’it, truma from outside Israel, meduma, and bikurim, their growth is chulin.  The growth of hekdesh and ma’aser sheni is chulin, and he redeems them when he plants it.If there are one hundred beds of truma and one of chulin, all of them are allowed of a species that the seed disintegrates, but where the seed does not disintegrate, even if it is one hundred chulin and one truma, they are all assur.Tevel, it’s growth is allowed in a species where the seed disintegrates, but in a species where the seed doesn’t disintegrate, its growth is assur.  What is a species where the seed does not disintegrate?  For example, luf, garlic, and onions.  Rabi Yehuda says, garlic is like barley (the seed disintegrates).One who weeds with a non-Jew in alliums, even though the product is tevel (despite the fact that the non-Jew owns it), he may eat randomly.  Truma seedlings which became tame, if they were replanted, they become tahor and do not make tame.  They are assur to be eaten until the edible part had been cut out (and then will subsequently regrow).  Rabi Yehuda says, until he cuts out and repeats (a second time).One put an onion into lentils, if it’s whole, it is mutar (even though one is truma).  If he cut it up, if it imparts flavor (it’s assur).  In any other cooked dish, whether cut or whole, it’s (assur) if it imparts flavor.  Rabi Yehuda allows (a whole union) in pickled fish, for it is simply used to remove odor (and not for flavor).An apple (truma) which one grated into a dough (chulin) and he leavened it, this is assur.  Barley (truma) which fell into a pit of water, even though it tainted the water, it’s mutar.One who takes hot bread (chulin) from the oven and puts it on the mouth of a jar of truma wine, Rabi Meir prohibits, and Rabi Yehuda permits.  Rabi Yossi allows by wheat bread, but prohibits by barley, for barley absorbs more.An oven which one heated with truma cumin and he baked in it, the bread is allows, for there is not flavor of cumin, only the scent.Fenugreek which fell into a vat of wine (chulin) and it was truma or ma’aser sheni, if there is in the seed enough to impart flavor, but not in the stalk (it’s assur).  If it was shvi’it, vineyard kilayim, or hekdesh, if there is in the seed and the stalk enough to impart flavor (it’s assur).One who had bundles of fenugreek of vineyard kilayim, he must burn them.  If the fenugreek bundles were of tevel, he pounds them and calculates how much seed there is in them and separate the seed, but he needn’t separate the stalk.  If he did separate, he may not say, I will beat and take the stalks and give the seeds, he must give the stalks with the seeds.Chulin olives which one pickled with truma olives, whether crushed chulin with crushed truma or whole truma, or in truma water, it’s assur.
