Mesechet BrachotAleph: Discusses the time of ma’ariv.  Rabi Eliezer – shkiyah – four at night.  Chachamim – until chatzot (6 at night).  Raban Gamliel says whenever the Chachamim say all night it’s until a lot hashachar, it’s just a siyag.Bet: Discusses zman kriyat shma.  Tana Kama – light enough to differentiate between white and tchelet.  Rabi Eliezer – between tchelet and green.  Until netz.  Rabi Yehoshua says until three during the day, because kings get up then.  If you read after that, you’re yotze, just as if you read it in the torah.Gimmel: Beit Shamay: beshochbecha uvkumecha denotes position.  Beit Hillel: u’velechtecha baderech means you say it any way, that only dictates the times.  Rav Tarfon followed Beit Shamay and put himself in danger.  They said you deserved it, you didn’t follow Beit Hillel.Daled: Shacharit has two brachot before and one after kriyat shma, ma’ariv has two and two – one long and one short.  You can’t change the formulation of brachot, i.e. long/ short, chatima/ no,Hay: You mention yetziat mitzrayim at night.  Rav Elazar Ben Azariah  says, I never got this until Ben Zoma explained it means day and night.  Chachamim say it means for this world and for when mashiach comes.Aleph: You’re reading in the torah and come upon kriyat shma. You’re yotze if you have kavana.  Rav Meir and Rabi Yehuda discuss when you can greet people during shma.Bet: Discusses the breaks in kriyat shma.  Why are the paragraphs of shma in the order they are?  Shma first because ol malchut shamayim before ol mitzvot.  Vehaya before vayomer because vehaya is day and night, and vayomer is only during the day.Gimmel: If you don’t hear what you say, you’re yotze on kriyat shma.  Rav Yossi disagrees.  Rav Yossi – if you slur letters, yotze.  Rabi Yehuda disagrees.  Read sentences out of order, not yotze.  Made a mistake, go back to that place.Daled: Artisans can read kriyat shma in high places, even though shmone esrey isn’t allowed.Hay: A chatan is patur on kriyat shma until motzey Shabbat, until he consummates. Raban Gamliel read the first night of his marriage.  His student’s said, he’s patur, and he said, he didn’t want to miss a mitzvah even for an hour.Vav: Raban Gamliel bathed the night his wife died.  His students said, avelim can’t bathe.  He said, I’m different, I’m sensitive (in my cleanliness).Zayin: Raban Gamliel sat shiva for his slave.  His students said, don’t you not?  He said, he’s different, he was worthy.Chet: A chatan can read kriyat shma the first night.  Raban Gamliel said only righteous people.Aleph: A person who lost someone is exempt from kriyat shma, shmone esrey, and tfillin.  Those who carry the coffin are also.  Those who won’t carry are chayav, but they all have an exemption from kriyat shma.Bet: If they have time to say it before they have to make the line of menachim, they should start.  The inner are patur but the outer are chayav.Gimmel: Women, slaves, and minors are patur in kriyat shma and tfillin, but chayav in shmone esrey, mezuzah, and birkat hamazon.Daled: A bal keri reads birkot kriyat shma to himself, not aloud.  He says bracha achrona, but not rishona (on food).  Rabi Yehuda says you do both.Hay. One remembers he’s a bal keri during kriyat shma, cut short.  If you have time for mikva, do.  If not, cover yourself in water – but not gross or laundry water.  One should be four amot from poop.Vav: A zav who became bal keri, a nida who discharged semen, and an active woman who becomes nida need mikva and Rabi Yehuda says it’s not chayav.Aleph: Shacharit until 6 during the day.  Rabi Yehuda says until four during the day.  Mincha until night.  Rabi Yehuda says until 9:30 during the day.  Ma’ariv is all night.  Musaf all day.  Rabi Yehuda – until 7 during the day.Bet: Rabi Nechunya Ben Hakana davened on his way into and out of the beit midrash.  They asked what it was.  Into – I won’t make others stumble, out of – for my lot.Gimmel: Raban Gamliel says you say shmone esrey.  Rabi Yehoshua says a short one.  Rabi Akiva says it depends if you can say the full one easily or not.Daled: Rabi Eliezer says no shmone esrey can be keva.  Rabi Yehoshua says, in danger you say a short one, and lays it out.Hay: Don’t say shmone esrey on a donkey.  If you can’t get down, turn.  If you can’t turn, have kavana to the Beit Hamikdash.Vav: On a boat, wagon, or raft, have the above kavana.Zayin: Rav Elazar Ben Azariah says musaf is only in a city, with a kehila.  Chachamim say anywhere.  Rabi Yehuda says if there is a minyan, the yachid is patur.Aleph: When saying shmone esrey, be in the right mindset.  Chasidim would prepare an hour.  Even if a king said hello or a snake was on him, he shouldn’t stop.Bet: Geshem is in tchiyat hameitim, ask for it in mevarech hashanim, and ata chonantanu is in chonen hada’at.  Rabi Akiva makes it its own bracha.  Rabi Eliezer says in modim.Gimmel: Certain tfilot aren’t ok.  If the shatz made a mistake, one takes his place and doesn’t refuse.  You start with the bracha where he faltered.Daled: The shatz doesn’t say amen after duchening, so he doesn’t get confused.  If he’s the only kohen, he doesn’t raise his hands unless he knows he won’t get confused.Hay: It’s a bad sign to make a mistake in tfilah.  If it’s the shatz, it’s bad for the tzibur.  Rabi Chanina ben Dosa would pray for the sick and knew who would live based on whether the tfilah went smoothly or not.Aleph: What brachot are there on fruits?  On trees ha’etz, except for on grapes, which are hagafen.  On ground fruit ha’adama, except for bread which is hamotzi.  Vegetables are ha’adama.  Rabi Yehuda says they’re boreh minei desha’im.Bet: An adama on etz is ok, but not vice versa.  Shehakol is ok on everything.Gimmel: If it’s not grown – shehakol.  Vinegar, unripe fruits, and locusts, shehakol.  Milk, cheese, and eggs, shehakol.  Rabi Yehuda says, all curses aren’t blessed on.Daled: If you have multiple fruits, Rabi Yehuda says bless on one of the shivat haminim.  Chachamim say bless on what you like best.Hay: If you blessed on wine before eating, you don’t have to bless on wine after eating.  So too with an appetizer.  If you blessed on bread, you don’t need to on the appetizer, but not vice versa.  Beit Shamay says it also doesn’t exempt porridge.Vav: If you sit and eat, you bench alone.  If you made it a group meal, you bench together. If wine comes to them during the meal, they bless separately.  After the meal, one blesses for all of them, and he blessed for besamim, for besamim is only brought after the se’uda.Zayin: If you have a salted fish with bread, you don’t bless on the bread – it’s tafel.  In general, the ikar is poter hatafel.Chet: If you have from shivat haminim, you bench according to Raban Gamliel.  Chachamim say to say al hamichiya.  Rabi Akiva said even if you eat cooked vegetable, if it’s your staple, you bench.  One who drinks water to quench thirst says shehakol.  Rabi Tarfon said, bore nefashot.Aleph: If three eat together, they have to make a zimun.  If you eat dmai, truma from a ma’aser, redeemed ma’aser sheni or hekdesh, or a servant who ate a kzayit, or a kuti, you make a zimun with them. But if you ate tevel, ma’aser that didn’t have truma taken, unredeemed ma’aser sheni or hekdesh, or a servant who ate less than a kzayit, or a non-Jew, you don’t do a zimun with them.Bet: Women, slaves, and minors aren’t included in a zimun.  How much do you need to have to be in a zimun?  A kzayit.  Rabi Yehuda says a kbeitza.Gimmel: How do you do a zimun?  With three you say, nevarech, four (or any number mentioned plus him), barchu. 10, nevarech elokeynu. One opinion is 1one or 110,000 it’s all the same.  The other lists things for 100, 1,000, and 10,000 and a response.  The second opinion is of Rabi Yossi Haglili, who says you do different things for different numbers according to a pasuk.  The first opinion is Rabi Akiva who says in a big or small shul, you still say barchu.  Raban Gamliel agrees with Rabi Akiva.Daled: If three eat together, they can’t separate to bench until they reach 6.  And 10 don’t separate until they reach 20.Hay: Two groups eating in one house.  If they can see each other, they bench together, if not, not.  Rabi Eliezer says you don’t bless on wine until you mix it, and Chachamim say you do.
