CHAPTER IX 

[[fol. 54 a.]] MISHNAH I—V 

I. He who beholds a place where miracles have been wrought for Israel says, "Blessed [art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe] Who wroughtest miracles for our fathers in this place." [He who beholds] a place from which idolatry has been uprooted says, "Blessed... Who hast uprooted idolatry from our land." 

II. For shooting stars, earthquakes, thunders, storms and lightnings he says, "Blessed...Whose strength and might fill the world." For mountains, hills, seas, rivers and deserts he says, "Blessed... Who hast made the creation." R. Judah states: He who beholds the ocean[1] says, "Blessed... Who hast made the ocean," but only when he beholds it at intervals. For rain and good tidings he says, "Blessed... Who art good and dispensest good." For bad tidings he says, "Blessed be the true Judge." 

III. He who has built a new house or bought new vessels says, "Blessed... Who hast kept us in life, hast preserved us and enabled us to reach this season," One says the benediction for a calamity apart from any attendant good, and for good fortune apart from any attendant evil ; but he who supplicates concerning that which is past utters a vain prayer. If his wife is pregnant and he says, "May it be Thy will that my wife bear a son," behold that is a vain prayer. If he were on the way, and hearing a cry of lamentation in the city, exclaims, "May it be Thy unll that it be not within my house," behold that is a vain prayer. 

IV. He who enters a town[2] should offer prayer twice, once on entering and once on leaving. Ben 'Azzai says : Four times, twice on entering and twice on leaving. He gives thanks for what is past and supplicates for what is yet to be. 

V. A man is in duty bound to utter a benediction for the bad even as he utters one for the good[3] ; as it is said, "And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might" (Deut. vi. 5) — "with all thy heart," i.e. with thy two impulses, with the good and the evil impulse[1] ; "with all thy soul," i.e. even if He take thy soul; "with all thy might," i.e. with all thy wealth. Another explanation of "with all thy might [meodeka]" — with whatever measure [middah] He metes out to thee, do Thou return Him thanks [modeh]. 

A man should not behave with levity towards the Eastern Gate [of the Temple], since it is directed towards the Holy of Holies. Nor may one enter the Temple Mount with his staff, his sandal, his wallet, and with the dust upon his feet ; nor may he use it as a short cut, and to expectorate [on the Temple Mount is forbidden] a fortiori. 

At the conclusion of every benediction in the Sanctuary they used to say "For ever[2]" ; but when the Minim[3] perverted the truth and declared that there is only one world, it was ordained that the wording should be "From everlasting to everlasting[4]." It was further ordained that a man should greet his friends by mentioning the Divine Name[5] ; as it is said, "And behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, The Lord be with you ; and they answered him. The Lord bless thee" (Ruth ii. 4); and it is said, "The Lord is with thee, thou mighty man of valour" (Judges vi. 12); and it is said, "And despise not thy mother when she is old" (Prov. xxiii. 22)[6]; and it is said, "It is time for the Lord to work ; they have made void Thy law" (Ps. cxix. 126). R. Nathan says : [This means,] They have made void Thy law, because it is time for the Lord to work. 

GEMARA 

Whence have we this[1]? R. Johanan said : Because the Scriptures state, "And Jethro said, Blessed be the Lord Who hath delivered you" etc. (Exod. xviii. 10). Do we say a benediction for the miracle wrought on behalf of the many but not for the miracle wrought on behalf of an individual? Lo, there was the man who was journeying by 'Eber Jamina[2] when a lion attacked him, and a miracle was wrought for him and he was rescued. He came before Raba who told him : Whenever thou reachest that spot, say "Blessed... Who hast wrought a miracle for me in this place." And Mar b. Rabina was passing through the valley of 'Arabot[3] and thirsted for water ; a miracle was wrought for him and a well was created and he drank. On another occasion, he was passing through the market-place of Mahoza[4] when a wild camel attacked him, and the wall was cleft for him and he went through it. Whenever he came to 'Arabot he said the benediction "Blessed... Who hast wrought for me a miracle in 'Arabot and with the camel" ; and whenever he came to the market-place of Mahoza he said, "Blessed... Who hast wrought for me a miracle with the camel and in 'Arabot." They answer[5] : In the case of a miracle wrought on behalf of the many, everybody is obliged to utter the benediction[6]; but in the case of a miracle wrought on behalf of an individual, only he[7] is obliged to say it. 

Our Rabbis have taught : He who beholds the fords of the [Red] Sea, or the fords of the Jordan, or the fords of the valleys of Arnon, or the hail-stones in the descent of Bet Horon[8], or the stone which Og, king of Bashan, sought to cast upon Israel[9], or the stone upon which Moses sat when Joshua fought against Amalek[1], or [the pillar of salt of] Lot's wife[2], or the wall of Jericho which was swallowed up in its place — over all these one must give thanks and praise before the All-present. 

It is quite right with the fords of the [Red] Sea ; for it is written, "And the children of Israel went into the midst of the Sea upon the dry ground" (Exod. xiv. 22). [It is quite right with] the fords of the Jordan; for it is written, "And the priests that bare the ark of [the covenant of][3] the Lord stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan, while all Israel passed over on dry ground, until all the nation were passed clean over the Jordan" (Josh. iii. 17). But the fords of the valleys of Arnon — whence is it [that a benediction is necessary]? For it is written, "Wherefore it is said in the book of the Wars of the Lord, Et and Heb in the rear[4] and the valleys of Arnon" etc. (Num. xxi. 14). It has been taught : "Et and Heb in the rear" were two lepers who journeyed in the rear of the camp. When the Israelites were to pass through [the valleys of Arnon], the Amorites came and made [[fol. 54 b.]] caves for themselves in which they hid, saying, "When the Israelites pass here we will kill them." But they knew not that the Ark was journeying before Israel and was lowering the rocks in front of them ; so when the Ark reached [the spot where the Amorites were in hiding], the rocks clave together, killing them, and their blood descended into the valleys of Arnon. When Et and Heb came and saw blood issuing from between the rocks, they went and told the Israelites and uttered a song. That is what is written, "And he poured out the valleys that incline toward the seat of Ar and lean upon the border of Moab" (ibid. v. 15)[5]. 

"Hail-stones" abne elgabish. What are abne elgabish ? It has been taught : They are stones which remained suspended [in the air] for the sake of a man[6] and descended for the sake of a man. They remained suspended for the sake of a man, viz.: Moses; for it is written, "Now the man Moses was very meek" (Num. xii. 3), and it is written, "And the thunders and hail ceased[1], and the rain poured not upon the earth" (Exod. ix, 33). They descended for the sake of a man, viz. Joshua ; for it is written, "Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is spirit" (Num. xxvii. 18), and it is written, "And it came to pass, as they fled from before[2] Israel, while they were at the descent of Beth-horon, that the Lord cast down great stones" (Josh. x. 11). 

"The stone which Og, king of Bashan, sought to cast upon Israel." A tradition has been handed down in this connection : Og said, "What is the extent of Israel's camp ? Three Parsah. I will go and uproot a mountain of the size of three Parsah, and cast it upon them so that I will kill them." He went and uprooted a mountain of the size of three Parsah and carried it upon his head ; but the Holy One, blessed be He, sent ants which bored a hole through it so that it sank about his neck. As he sought to draw it off, his teeth were extended on both sides, so that it was impossible to extricate himself. That is what is written, "Thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked" (Ps. iii. 8) ; and it is in accord with the statement of R. Simeon b. Lakish who said: What means that which is written, "Thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked"? Read not "Thou hast broken" [shibbarta] but "Thou hast prolonged" [shirbabta]. What was the height of Moses? Ten cubits[3]. He took an axe ten cubits long, jumped to a height of ten cubits and struck Og on his ankle[4] and killed him. 

"The stone upon which Moses sat"; for it is written, "But Moses' hands were heavy ; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon" (Exod. xvii. 12). [Had not Moses a cushion or bolster upon which to sit ? But thus spake Moses : Since Israel are now enduring hardship, I too will endure hardship with them[5].] 

"Lot's wife" ; as it is said, "But his wife looked back from behind him and she became a pillar of salt" (Gen. xix. 26)[6]. It is quite right with all these miracles[1] ; but that of Lot's wife was a punishment[2] ! [On beholding it] one should say "Blessed be the true Judge[3]." But it mentions above thanksgiving and praise ! It has been taught : For Lot and his wife we say two benedictions — for his wife one says, "Blessed be the true Judge" ; and for Lot one says, "Blessed... Who rememberest the righteous." R. Johanan said : Even at the time of His wrath, the Holy One, blessed be He, remembers the righteous ; as it is said, "And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the Plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow" (Gen. xix. 29). 

"And the wall of Jericho which was swallowed up." And the wall of Jericho which was swallowed up ! Lo, it fell ! As it is said, "And it came to pass when the people heard the sound of the horn, that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down flat" (Josh. vi. 20). Since its breadth and height were equal, it must in consequence have been swallowed up [in the earth][4]. 

Rab Judah said in the name of Rab[5] : Four classes of people must offer thanksgiving : They who go down to the sea, who journey in the desert[6], the invalid who recovers and the prisoner who has been set free. "They who go down to the sea" — whence have we this ? For it is written, "They that go down to the sea in ships... these saw the works of the Lord... He raised the stormy wind... They mounted up to the heaven, they went down to the deeps... They reeled to and fro, and staggered like a drunken man... They cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and He brought them out of their distresses. He made the storm a calm... Then were they glad because they were quiet... Let them give thanks unto the Lord for His mercy, and for His wonderful works to the children of men" (Ps. cvii. 23-31). "They who journey in the desert" — whence have we this ? For it is written, "They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way ; they found no city of habitation...Then they cried unto the Lord... and He led them by a straight way... Let them give thanks unto the Lord for His mercy" (ibid. vv. 4-8). "The invalid who recovers" — whence have we this? For it is written, "Crazed because of the way of their transgression, and afflicted because of their iniquities, their soul abhorred all manner of food... They cried unto the Lord in their trouble... He sent His word and healed them...Let them give thanks unto the Lord for His mercy" (Ps. cvii. 17—21). "The prisoner who has been set free" — whence have we this? For it is written, "Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death... because they rebelled against the words of God...Therefore He humbled their heart with travail... They cried unto the Lord in their trouble... He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death... Let them give thanks unto the Lord for His mercy" (ibid. vv. 10-15). 

What benediction should he utter? Rab Judah said, "Blessed ...Who bestowest lovingkindnesses[1]." Abbai said : It is necessary for him to offer his thanksgiving in the presence of ten ; for it is written, "Let them exalt Him in the assembly of the people" etc. (ibid. V. 32). Mar Zotra said : Two of them must be Rabbis ; as it is said, "And praise Him in the seat of the elders" (ibid.). Rab Ashe[2] retorted : Say that they must all be Rabbis ! But is it written, "In the assembly of elders" ? No, it is written, "In the assembly of the people." Then say[3]: [He must offer thanksgiving] in the presence of ten ordinary persons and two Rabbis ! The question [remains unanswered]. 

Rab Judah was ill and recovered. Rab Hanna[4] of Bagdat[5] and other Rabbis went in to visit him. They said to him, "Blessed be the All-merciful Who has given thee back to us and has not given thee to the dust." He said to them, "You have exempted me from the obligation of thanksgiving." But lo, Abbai said : He must offer thanksgiving in the presence of ten ! There were ten present. But it was not he who ottered thanksgiving ! It was not necessary, because he responded "Amen" after them. 

Rab Judah said : Three require guarding[6], viz. : an invalid, a bridegroom and a bride. In a Baraita it is taught : An invalid[7], woman in confinement, bridegroom and bride. Some say : Also a mourner[8]; and others add: Also disciples of the wise at night[9]. 

Rab Judah also said : There are three things which, if one prolong, lengthen his days and years ; viz. Who prolongs his prayer, his stay at table and in the privy. "Who prolongs his prayer" — is that a virtue ? And lo, R. Hiyya b. Abba said in the name of R. Johanan : Whoever prolongs his prayer and calculates on it [[fol. 55 a.]] will eventually come to pain of heart; as it is said, "Hope deferred maketh the heart sick" (Prov. xiii. 12)[1]. And R. Isaac said: Three things cause the sins of a man to be remembered ; viz. [passing under] a wall threatening to fall[2], calculating on prayer and surrendering one's case against a man to Heaven[3] ! There is no contradiction ; the latter refers to where one calculates [on the prolongation of his prayer], the other to where he does not calculate upon it. So how should one act ? He makes many supplications. "He who prolongs his stay at table" — perhaps a poor man will come and he will give him [some food] ; for it is written, "The altar of wood three cubits high... and he said unto me, This is the table that is before the Lord" (Ezek. xli. 22). He opens with "altar" and concludes with "table"! R. Johanan and R. Eleazar both say : So long as the Temple was in existence, the altar used to atone for Israel, but now a man's table atones for him[4]. "He who prolongs his stay in the privy" — is that a virtue? Lo, there is a teaching : Ten things cause a man piles[5] : Eating the leaves of reeds, the leaves of the vine, the sprouts of the vine, the palate[6] of an animal[7], the backbone of a fish, salted fish which has not been sufficiently cooked, to drink the lees of wine, to wipe oneself [after evacuation] with lime, potters' clay, or pebbles with which another has wiped himself ; and some add : Also unduly to strain oneself in the privy ! There is no contradiction ; the latter refers to one who stays and strains, the other to one who stays long but does not strain. It is like the incident where a certain matron[1] said to R. Judah b. R. El'ai, "Thy face is like that of pig-rearers and usurers[2]." He replied, "On my faith ! Both [occupations] are forbidden me ; but there are twenty-four privies from my lodging-place to the House of Study, and whenever I go there I test myself in all of them." 

Rab Judah also said[3] : Three things shorten a man's days and years : To be given a Scroll of the Torah from which to read [a portion in the Synagogue] and decline to read ; to be handed the cup of benediction to say Grace and decline ; and to give oneself an air of superiority[4]. "To be given a Scroll of the Torah from which to read and decline to read" — for it is written, "For that is thy life and the length of thy days" (Deut. xxx. 20). "To be handed the cup of benediction to say Grace and decline" — for it is written, "I will bless them that bless thee" (Gen. xii. 3)[5]. "To give oneself an air of superiority" — for R. Hamma b. R. Hannina[6] said : Why did Joseph die before his brothers[7]? Because he gave himself superior airs. 

Rab Judah also said in the name of Rab : For three things it is necessary to offer supplication : A good king, a good year, and a good dream. "A good king" — for it is written, "The king's heart is in the hand of the Lord as the water-courses" (Prov. xxi. 1). "A good year" — for it is written, "The eyes of the Lord thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year" (Deut. xi. 12). "A good dream" — for it is written, "Wherefore cause Thou me to dream[8] and make me to live" (Is. xxxviii. 16). 

R. Johanan said : There are three things which the Holy One, blessed be He, Himself proclaims, viz. : famine, plenty and a good leader. "Famine" — for it is written, "The Lord hath called for a famine" (II Kings viii. 1). "Plenty" — for it is written, "I will call for the corn and will increase it" (Ezek. xxxvi. 29). "A good leader" — for it is written, "And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, See I have called by name Besalel, the son of Uri" etc. (Exod. xxxi. 1 f.). 

R. Isaac said : "We must not appoint a leader over the Community without first consulting them ; as it is said, "See, the Lord hath called by name Besalel, the son of Uri" (ibid. xxxv. 30). The Holy One, blessed be He, asked Moses, "Is Besalel acceptable to thee?" He replied, "Lord of the universe, if he is acceptable to Thee, how much more so to me!" He said to him, "Nevertheless, go and tell the people." He went and asked Israel, "Is Besalel acceptable to you?" They answered, "If he is acceptable to the Holy One, blessed be He, and to thee, how much more so to us ! " 

R. Samuel b. Nahmani said in the name of R. Jonathan : He was called Basalel because of his wisdom : for at the time that the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, "Go, tell Besalel, 'Make for Me a tabernacle, an ark and vessels[1]'," Moses went and inverted the order, saying to him, "Make an ark and vessels and a tabernacle[2]." He replied, "Moses, our teacher, it is the way of the world for a man to build a house and afterwards furnish it ; but thou sayest, 'Make for Me an ark, vessels and a tabernacle'! Where shall I place the vessels which I make? Perhaps thus spake the Holy One, blessed be He, unto thee, 'Make a tabernacle, an ark and vessels'." Moses replied, "Perhaps thou wert in the shadow of God[3] and thou knowest this." 

Rab Judah said in the name of Rab : Besalel knew how to combine the letters[4] with which the heavens and earth had been created ; for it is written here, "And He hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom and in understanding and in knowledge" (Exod. xxxv. 31), and it is written elsewhere, "The Lord by wisdom founded the earth ; by understanding He established the heavens" (Prov. iii. 19) and "By His knowledge the depths were broken up" (ibid. V. 20). 

R. Johanan said : The Holy One, blessed be He, only gives wisdom to him who has wisdom ; as it is said, "He giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding" (Dan. ii. 21 ). Rab Tahlifa the Palestinian[1] heard this and repeated it in the presence of R. Abbahu. He said to him : You learn it from there ; but I learn it from the following, for it is written, "In the hearts of all that are wise-hearted I have put wisdom" (Exod. xxxi. 6)[2]. 

Rab Hisda said : [There is no reality in] any dream without a fast[3]. Rab Hisda also said : An uninterpreted dream is like an unread letter[4]. Rab Hisda also said : Neither a good nor a bad dream is fulfilled in every detail. Rab Hisda also said : A bad dream is preferable to a good dream[5]. Rab Hisda also said : When a dream is bad, the pain it causes is sufficient [to prevent its fulfilment], and when the dream is good, the joy it brings is sufficient. Rab Joseph said : As for a good dream, even in my own case[6], its cheerfulness frustrates it [so that it is not realised]. Rab Hisda also said : A bad dream is worse than scourging ; as it is said, "God hath so made it that men should fear before Him" (Eccles. iii. 14), and Rabbah b. Bar Hannah said in the name of R. Johanan : This refers to a bad dream[7]. 

"The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream ; and he that hath My word, let him speak My word faithfully. What hath the straw to do with the wheat ? saith the Lord" (Jer. xxiii. 28). What connection has "straw and wheat" with a dream ? But said R. Johanan in the name of R. Simeon b. Johai : Just as one cannot have wheat without straw, similarly it is impossible for a dream to be without something that is vain. R. Berekiah said : A dream, though it be fulfilled in part, is never completely realised. Whence is this learnt? From Joseph; for it is written, "And behold the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me" (Gen. xxxvii. 9); but at that time his mother[1] was no longer [[fol. 55b.]] living. R. Levi said : A man should always wait up to twenty-two years for [the fulfilment of] a good dream. Whence is this learnt ? From Joseph ; for it is written, "These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old" etc. (ibid. v. 2)[2], and it is written, "And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh" (ibid. xli. 46). From seventeen to thirty — how many years is it? Thirteen ; add the seven years of plenty and two of famine[3], hence we get twenty-two. 

Rab Huna said : A good man is not shown a good dream[4] and a bad man is not shown a bad dream[5]. There is a teaching to the same effect: Throughout David's lifetime he never saw a good dream, and throughout Ahitophel's lifetime he did not see a bad dream. But lo, it is written, "There shall no evil befall thee" (Ps. xci. 10), and Rab Hisda said in the name of Rab Jeremiah b. Abba : [These words mean,] neither bad dreams nor evil thoughts will trouble thee[6]! Nay; the good man sees no evil dream, but others dream about him. And since he sees no [dream] himself, is that an advantage ? For lo, R. Ze'ira[7] said : Whoever abides seven days without a dream is called evil ; as it is said, "He shall abide satisfied, he shall not be visited by evil" (Prov. xix. 23). Read not sabea' "satisfied" but sheba' "seven."[8]! Nay, this is what he means to say : The good man sees a dream but [the next morning] he does not know what he has seen[9]. 

Rab Huna b. Ammi[10] stated that R. Pedat said in the name of R. Johanan : He who sees a dream and his soul is depressed[11] should go and have it interpreted in the presence of three. He should have it interpreted ! But Rab Hisda has said : An uninterpreted dream is like an unread letter[1] ! Nay, but say : He should have it turned into good in the presence of three. He should assemble three men and say to them, "I have seen a good dream" ; and they should say to him, "Good it is and may it be good. May the All-merciful turn it to good ; seven times may it be decreed concerning thee from Heaven that it should be good, and may it be good." Then they should recite three verses in which the word hapak "turn" occurs, three in which padah "redeem" occurs, and three in which shalom "peace" occurs. Three verses in which "turn" occurs — "Thou didst turn for me my mourning into dancing ; Thou didst loose my sackcloth and gird me with gladness" (Ps. xxx. 12); "Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, and the young men and the old together; for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow" (Jer. xxxi. 12); "Nevertheless the Lord thy God would not hearken unto Balaam; but the Lord thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto thee" (Deut. xxiii. 6). Three verses in which the word "redeem" occurs — "He hath redeemed my soul in peace so that none came nigh me" (Ps. Iv. 19) ; "And the redeemed of the Lord shall return and come with singing unto Zion...and sorrow and sighing shall flee away" (Is. XXXV. 10) ; "And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel?... So the people rescued [padah] Jonathan, that he died not" (I Sam. xiv, 45). Three verses in which the word "peace" occurs — "Peace, peace, to him that is far off and to him that is near, saith the Lord that createth the fruit of the lips ; and I will heal him" (Is. lvii. 19) ; "Then the spirit clothed Amasai, who was chief of the captains : Thine are we, David, and on thy side, thou son of Jesse ; peace, peace be unto thee, and peace be to thy helpers; for thy God helpeth thee" (I Chron. xii. 18); "Thus ye shall say, All hail! and peace be both unto thee, and peace be to thy house, and peace be unto all that thou hast" (I Sam. xxv. 6).
 
Amemar, Mar Zotra and Rab Ashe were sitting together; they said: Let each one of us relate something which the others have not heard. One of them commenced and said : He who has seen a dream and knows not what he has seen, let him stand before the Kohanim at the time that they spread their hands [to pronounce the priestly benediction] and utter the following[1] : "Lord of the universe ! I am Thine and my dreams are Thine ; a dream have I dreamed and I know not what it is. Whether I dreamed concerning myself, or my fellows dreamed concerning me, or I dreamed concerning others, if they be good dreams, strengthen and fortify them [and may they be fulfilled][2] like the dreams of Joseph ; but if they require to be remedied, heal them as the waters of Marah [were healed] by the hands of Moses our teacher, as Miriam [was healed] from her leprosy[3], as Hezekiah from his illness, and like the waters of Jericho [sweetened] by the hands of Elisha. And as Thou didst turn the curse of the wicked Balaam into a blessing, so do Thou turn all my dreams for me into good." He should conclude [his prayer] simultaneously with the Kohanim, so that the Congregation responds "Amen." But if not[4], let him say the following: "Thou majestic One in the heights, Who abidest in might, Thou art peace and Thy name is peace. May it be Thy will to grant us peace." 

The next commenced and said : He who enters a town[5] and is afraid of the Evil Eye[6], let him take his right thumb in his left hand and his left thumb in his right hand and say the following: "I, A the son of B, come from the seed of Joseph against whom the Evil Eye had no power ; as it is said, 'Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine by a fountain' (Gen. xlix. 22)[7]. Read not 'ale 'ayin 'by a fountain' but 'ole 'ayin 'overcoming the [Evil] Eye'." R. Jose b. R. Hannina said : It may be derived from the verse : "And let them[8] grow [weyidgu] into a multitude in the midst of the earth" (ibid, xlviii. 16) ; i.e. as the fishes [dagim] in the sea are covered by the water and the Evil Eye cannot have power over them, in similar manner the Evil Eye has no power over the seed of Joseph. Should he, however, be afraid of his own Evil Eye, let him gaze upon the wing of his left nostril. 

The third of them commenced and said : He who is ill should not disclose the fact on the first day so as not to cause himself bad luck, but after that he may disclose it. As when Raba fell ill, on the first day he did not disclose it, but after that be said to his attendant, "Go, announce that Raba is ill. Let him who loves me pray on my behalf, and let him that hates me rejoice over my plight ; for it is written, 'Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thy heart be glad when he stumbleth ; lest the Lord see it and it displease Him, and He turn away His wrath from him' (Prov. xxiv. 17 f.)." 

When Samuel had a bad dream, he used to say, "The dreams speak falsely" (Zech. x. 2) ; but when he had a good dream, he used to say, "Do the dreams speak falsely? For lo, it is written, 'I [God] do speak with him in a dream' (Num. xii. 6)." Raba asked : It is written, "I do speak with him in a dream," and it is written, "The dreams speak falsely" ! There is no contradiction ; the former being through an angel, the latter through an evil spirit. 

R. Bizna b. Zabda stated that R. 'Akiba said in the name of R. Panda, in the name of R. Nahum, in the name of R. Biryam, in the name of an Elder — and who is he? R. Banaah[1]: There were twenty-four interpreters of dreams in Jerusalem. I once had a dream and went to consult them all ; but the interpretation each gave me differed from that of the others. Nevertheless all their interpretations were realised in me ; to fulfil that which was said "All dreams follow the mouth [of the interpreter][2]." Is there such a Scriptural passage as "All dreams follow the mouth[3]"? Yes; and it is like the statement of R. Eleazar who said : Whence is it that all dreams follow the mouth ? As it is said, "And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was" (Gen. xli. 13). Raba said : That is only so if he interprets it from the content of the dream; as it is said, "To each man according to his dream he did interpret" (ibid. v. 12). "When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good" (ibid. xl. 16) — how did he know this[1]? R. Eleazar said : This teaches that each of them was shown the dream and interpretation of the other. 

R. Johanan said : If one wakes up and a verse comes to his mouth[2], it is to be regarded as a minor prophecy. R. Johanan also said : Three types of dream are fulfilled — a morning dream, a dream which his friend has about him, and a dream interpreted in the midst of a dream. Some add : Also a dream which is repeated ; as it is said, "And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice" (Gen. xli. 32). 

R. Samuel b. Nahmani said in the name of R. Jonathan : A man is only shown[3] [in a dream what emanates] from the thoughts of his heart ; as it is said, "As for thee, O king, thy thoughts  came into thy mind upon thy bed" (Dan. ii. 29). Or if thou wilt I can say from this passage, "That thou mayest know the thoughts of thy heart" (ibid. v. 30). Raba[4] said : Thou mayest know this from the fact that a man is never shown [in a dream] a golden date-palm or an elephant entering the eye of a needle[5]. 

The Roman Emperor said to R. Joshua b. R. Hannina[6], "You [[fol. 56 a.]] declare that you are wise. Tell me what I shall see in my dream." He replied, "Thou wilt see the Persians enslaving thee, despoiling thee, and making thee pasture unclean animals with a golden crook." The Emperor reflected upon it the whole day and in the night saw it [in a dream][7]. 

King Shapor said to Samuel, "You declare that you are very wise. Tell me what I shall see in my dream." He replied, "Thou wilt see the Romans come and take thee captive and make thee grind date-stones[8] in a golden mill." The king reflected upon it the whole day and in the night saw it [in a dream][9]. 

Bar Hedja was an interpreter of dreams. When one paid him a fee, he interpreted [the dream] favourably ; but if no fee was given him, he interpreted it unfavourably. Abbai and Raba had a dream ; Abbai gave him a Zuz but Raba gave him nothing. They said to him : We were made to read in our dream the words "Thine ox shall be slain before thine eyes" (Deut. xxviii. 31). To Raba he said : Thy business will fail, and thou wilt have no desire to eat because of the grief of thy heart. To Abbai he said : Thy business will prosper, and thou wilt have no desire to eat because of the joy of thy heart. They said to him : We were made to read in our dream the words "Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, but they shall not be thine, for they shall go into captivity" (ibid. V. 41). To Raba he replied in an unfavourable sense. To Abbai he said : Thy sons and daughters will be many, and thy daughters will marry [husbands in distant parts of] the world, so that they will seem to thee as though they had gone into captivity, [They said to him : In our dream] we were made to read the words "Thy sons and thy daughters shall he given unto another people " (ibid. v. 32), To Abbai he said : Thy sons and daughters will be many ; thou wilt say [they should marry] thy relatives, but [thy wife] will say they [should marry] her relatives, and she will compel thee to give them to her relatives, and it will seem [as though they had been given] to another people. To Raba he said : Thy wife will die, and thy sons and daughters will come under the control of another wife. For Raba[1] said in the name of R. Jeremiah b. Abba in the name of Rab : What means that which is written, "Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people"? This refers to a stepmother. [They said to Bar Hedja] : We were made to read in our dream the words "Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy" (Eccles, ix. 7). To Abbai he said : Thy business will prosper and thou wilt eat and drink and read Scriptural verses from the joy of thy heart. To Raba he said : Thy business will fail, thou wilt slaughter [cattle] but not eat, and thou wilt drink and read Scriptural verses to banish thy dread. We were made to read the words "Thou shalt carry much seed out into the field, and shalt gather little in for the locust will consume it" (Deut. xxviii. 38). To Abbai he gave an interpretation from the first half of the verse ; to Raba from the latter half. We were made to read the words "Thou shalt have olive-trees throughout all thy borders, but thou shalt not anoint thyself with the oil, for thine olives shall drop off" (Deut. xxviii, 40). To Abbai he gave an interpretation from the first half of the verse ; to Raba from the latter half. We were made to read the words "And all the peoples of the earth shall see that the name of the Lord is called upon thee, and they shall be afraid of thee" (ibid. v. 10). To Abbai he said : Thy fame will go forth as the Principal of the College and the fear of thee will be widespread in the world. To Raba he said : The king's treasury will be broken into and thou wilt be arrested as one of the thieves, and everybody will draw an inference from thee[1]. The next day the king's treasury was broken into, and they came and arrested Raba. 

They said [to Bar Hedja] : We saw [in a dream] lettuce upon the mouth of a jar. To Abbai he said : Thy business will be doubled like the lettuce. To Raba he said : Thy business will be bitter like the lettuce. They said to him : We saw [in a dream] meat upon the mouth of a jar. To Abbai he said : Thy wine[2] will be sweet and everybody will come to buy meat and wine of thee. To Raba he said : Thy wine will be sour and everybody will come to buy meat to eat therewith. They said to him : We saw [in a dream] a jug hanging upon a date-palm. To Abbai he said : Thy wares will be exalted like the palm. To Raba he said : Thy wares will be sweet as dates[3]. They said to him : We saw [in a dream] a pomegranate sprouting on the mouth of a jar. To Abbai he said : Thy wares will be high-priced like the pomegranate. To Raba he said : Thy wares will be stale [and taste] like the pomegranate. They said to him : We saw [in a dream] a jug fall into a well. To Abbai he said : Thy wares will be sought as one says, "A piece of bread fell into a well and cannot be found[4]." To Raba he said : Thy wares will go bad and thou wilt cast them into a well. They said to him : We saw [in a dream] a young ass standing by the side of our pillow and braying. To Abbai he said : Thou wilt become the President of the College and an Amora will stand by thee. To Raba he said : The words "the firstling of an ass" (Exod. xiii. 13) have been erased from thy Tefillin[5]. Raba said to him : I have myself seen that the words are there. He replied : The letter waw in the word hamor "ass" has certainly been erased from thy Tefillin[1]. 

Later on Raba went to him alone and said : I dreamt that the outer door fell. He replied : Thy wife will die[2]. He said : I dreamt that my back and front teeth fell out. He replied that his sons and daughters would die. He said : I dreamt of two doves flying. He replied : Thou wilt divorce two wives[3]. He said : I dreamt of two turnip-tops. He replied : Thou wilt receive two blows[4]. That day Raba went and sat in the House of Study the whole day[5]. He found there two blind men quarrelling with each other. Raba went to part them, and they struck him twice. They raised [their sticks] to give him another blow ; but he cried, "That's enough! I only dreamt of two!" 

Finally Raba came and gave [Bar Hedja] a fee, and said to him : I dreamt of a wall falling. He replied : Thou wilt acquire a boundless estate. He said to him : I dreamt that Abbai's house collapsed and its dust covered me. He replied : Abbai will die and his [Office as Principal of the] College will revert to thee. He said to him : I dreamt that my house collapsed and everybody came to take each a brick. He replied : Thy teachings will be scattered throughout the world. He said to him : I dreamt that my head was split open and my brains fell out. He replied : The stuffing will fall out of thy bolster. He said to him : I dreamt that I was made to read the Hallel of Egypt[6]. He replied : Many miracles will happen to thee. 

[Once Bar Hedja] went with Raba on a boat; he said [to himself] "Why should I accompany a man to whom miracles will happen[7]?" As he descended [from the boat] a book[8] of his fell. Raba found it and saw written therein, "All dreams follow the mouth [of the interpreter]." He exclaimed, "Thou rascal ! It rested with thee [whether my dreams were auspicious or not], and thou didst cause me all this pain. I forgive thee everything except [what thou didst say about][1] the daughter of Rab Hisda[2]. May it be His will that this fellow be handed over into the power of the Government and it have no mercy on him!" Bar Hedja said, "What can I do ? There is a tradition that the curse of a wise man, even when undeserved, comes to pass ; and how much more so that of Raba who has justification for uttering a curse!" He said [to himself] "I will go into exile[3]; for a teacher has said, 'Exile[4] atones for sins'." He went into exile amoug the Romans, and sat down at the door of the king's treasury[5]. The wardrobe-keeper had a dream and said to him : I dreamt that a needle entered my finger. Bar Hedja said, "Give me a Zuz" ; but he refused, so he gave him no reply. Then the wardrobe-keeper said : I dreamt that decay[6] seized two of my fingers. He said, "Give me a Zuz" ; but he refused and received no answer. He said to him : I dreamt that decay seized my whole hand. He replied : Decay has seized all the [king's] silken garments. The king's household heard of this and they brought the wardrobe-keeper to put him to death. He said to the king, "Why me? Take him who knew but spoke not." They took Bar Hedja, and he said to him, "Because of the Zuz [which I refused thee], destruction has come upon the king's silken garments." They tied two cedars [[fol. 56 b.]] with a rope, bound one foot to one cedar and the other foot to the other cedar, and then released the rope. When he was decapitated each tree bounded back to its original position, and his body fell in two. 

Ben Dama, the son of Ishmael's sister, asked R. Ishmael : I dreamt that both my cheekbones fell out. He replied : Two Roman nobles planned to do thee harm but they died[7]. Bar Kappara said to Rabbi[8]: I dreamt that my nose fell off. He replied : The divine wrath has departed from thee[9]. He said to him : I dreamt that both my hands were cutoff. He replied : Thou wilt not be dependent upon the work of thy hands. He said to him : I dreamt that both my legs were amputated. He replied : Thou wilt ride upon a horse. 

He said to him : I dreamt that somebody told me, "Thou wilt die in Adar and not behold Nisan." He replied : Thou wilt die in honour [idruta] and not fall into the power of temptation [nissayon].
 
A certain Min said to R. Ishmael[1] : I dreamt that I poured oil upon olives. He replied that he had outraged his mother[2], He said to him : I dreamt that I plucked a star. He replied : Thou hast stolen the son of an Israelite. He said to him : I dreamt that I swallowed a star. He replied : The son of an Israelite thou didst sell and eat up the proceeds. He said to him : I dreamt that my eyes kissed one another. He replied that he had outraged his sister. He said to him : I dreamt that I kissed the moon. He replied that he had outraged the wife of an Israelite. He said to him : I dreamt that I walked in the shade of a myrtle. He replied that he had outraged a betrothed maiden. He said to him : I dreamt there was a shadow over me and yet it was beneath me. He replied that he had gratified an unnatural lust. He said to him : I dreamt that ravens came to my bed. He replied : Thy wife has been unfaithful with many men. He said to him: I dreamt that doves came to my bed. He replied: Many women hast thou defiled. He said to him : I dreamt that I held two doves and they flew away. He replied : Thou didst marry two women and parted from them without a document of divorce. He said to him : I dreamt that I was shelling eggs. He replied : The dead hast thou stripped. He said to him, "I am guilty of all these acts with the exception of the last which is not [true]." Just then a woman came and said to him, "That cloak which thou art wearing belonged to so-and-so who died and thou didst strip him of it." He said to him : I dreamt that I was told, "Thy father has left thee property in Cappadocia[3]." He asked, "Hast thou property in Cappadocia?" He replied, "No." "Hast thy father been to Cappadocia?" "No," he answered. "In that case Kappa means 'a beam' and Deka 'ten.' Go, examine the beam which heads number ten, for it is full of coins[4]." He went and found it full of coins. 

R. Hannina said : Who dreams of a well will see peace ; as it is said, "And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of living water" (Gen. xxvi. 19)[1]. R. Nathan[2] said : He will find Torah; as it is said, "Whoso findeth me findeth life" (Prov. viii. 35), and it is written here "a well of living water[3]." Raba said : [It means] life literally. 

R. Hanan[4] said : There are three [types of dreams which indicate] peace — a river, bird and pot. "A river" — for it is written, "Behold I will extend peace to her like a river" (Is. Ixvi. 12). "A bird" — for it is written, "As birds hovering, so will the Lord of hosts protect Jerusalem" (ibid. xxxi. 5). "A pot" — for it is written, "Lord, Thou wilt establish[5] peace for us" (ibid. xxvi. 12). R. Hannina said : But it must be a pot in which there is no meat; for it is said[6], "They chop them in pieces, as that which is in the pot, and as flesh within the caldron" (Micah iii. 3)[7]. 

R. Joshua b. Levi said : Who dreams of a river should on rising say, "Behold I will extend peace to her like a river" (Is. Ixvi. 12), before another verse occurs to him, viz. : "For distress will come  in like a river" (ibid. lix. 19). Who dreams of a bird should on rising say, "As birds hovering so will the Lord of hosts protect" (ibid. xxxi. 5), before another verse occurs to him, viz. : "As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that wandereth from his place" (Prov. xxvii. 8). Who dreams of a pot should on rising say, "Lord, Thou wilt establish [shapat] peace for us" (Is. xxvi. 12), before another verse occurs to him, viz. : "Set on [shapat] the pot, set it on" (Ezek. xxiv. 3). Who dreams of grapes should on rising say, "I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness" (Hos. ix. 10) before another verse occurs to him, viz.: "Their grapes are grapes of gall" (Deut. xxxii. 32). Who dreams of a mountain should on rising say, "How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of the messenger of good things" (Is. lii. 7), before another verse occurs to him, viz.: "For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing" (Jer. ix. 9). Who dreams of a horn should on rising say, "And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great horn shall be blown" (Is. xxvii. 13), before another verse occurs to him, viz. : "Blow ye the horn of Gibeah" (Hos. V. 8). Who dreams of a dog should on rising say, "But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog whet his tongue" (Exod. xi. 7), before another verse occurs to him, viz. : "Yea, the dogs are greedy" (Is. Ivi. 11). Who dreams of a lion should on rising say, "The lion hath roared, who will not fear?" (Amos iii. 8), before another verse occurs to him, viz. : "A lion is gone up from his thicket" (Jer. iv. 7). Who dreams of shaving should on rising say, "And [Joseph] shaved himself and changed his raiment" (Gen. xli. 14), before another verse occurs to him, viz. : "If I be shaven, then my strength will go from me" (Judges xvi. 17). Who dreams of a well should on rising say, "A well of living waters" (Cant. iv. 15), before another verse occurs to him, viz. : "As a cistern welleth with her waters, so she welleth with her wickedness" (Jer. vi. 7). Who dreams of a reed should on rising say, "A bruised reed shall he not break" (Is. xlii. 3), before another verse occurs to him, viz. : "Behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed" (ibid, xxxvi. 6). 

Our Rabbis have taught : Who dreams of a reed [kaneh] may hope for wisdom ; as it is said, "Get [keneh] wisdom" (Prov. iv. 5). Who dreams of reeds may hope for understanding ; as it is said, "With all thy getting get understanding" (ibid. v. 7)[1]. R. Zera said: A pumpkin [kara], a palm-heart [kora], wax [kira] and a reed [kanya] are all auspicious in a dream[2]. There is a teaching[3] : Nobody is shown a gourd [in a dream] except him who is a fearer of Heaven with all his strength[4]. Who dreams of an ox should on rising say, "His firstling bullock, majesty is his" (Deut. xxxiii. 17), before another occurs to him, viz. : "If an ox gore a man" (Exod. xxi. 28). 

Our Rabbis have taught : Five things are said in connection with the ox : Who [dreams that he] eats of its flesh will grow rich; that an ox had gored him, he will have sons who will contend with[5] each other in Torah; that it bit him, sufferings will come upon him ; that it kicked him, a long journey is destined for him ; that he rode upon it, he will ascend to greatness. But there is a teaching : [One who dreams of] riding upon an ox will die ! There is no contradiction, the former referring [to a dream wherein] he rides upon the ox, the latter to when the ox rides on him. 

Who dreams of an ass may hope for salvation[1] ; as it is said, "Behold thy king cometh unto thee: he is triumphant and victorious, lowly, and riding upon an ass" (Zech. ix. 9). Who dreams of a cat in a place where the word for it is Shunnara, a beautiful song [shirah naah] will be composed in his honour ; [but where the word for it is] Shinnara, a change for the worse [shinnui ra'] is in store for him[2]. Who dreams of grapes, if they are white, both in their season and out of season, they are a good omen ; if they are black, in their season they are a good omen, but out of season a bad omen[3]. Who dreams of a white horse, whether standing still or galloping, it is a good omen for him ; if it is roan, should it be standing still, it is a good omen; should it be galloping, it is a bad omen. Who dreams of Ishmael, his prayer will be heard[4]; but only of Ishmael the son of Abraham, and not of an ordinary Arab[5]. Who dreams of a camel, death had been decreed upon him by Heaven, but he has been delivered therefrom. R. Hamma[6] b. R. Hannina said : What is the Scriptural authority for this ? "I will go down with thee into Egypt ; and I will also surely bring thee up again" (Gen. xlvi. 4)[7]. Rab Nahman b. Isaac[8] said : It may be derived from the following, "The Lord also[9] hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die" (II Sam. xii. 13). Who dreams of Phineas, a miracle will be wrought for him[10]. Who dreams of an elephant [pil], miracles [pela'ot] will be wrought for him; of elephants, miracles upon miracles will be performed for him. But there is a teaching : To dream of all kinds of animals is a good omen with the exception of the elephant and ape ! There is no [[fol. 57a.]] contradiction ; the former referring to animals which are bridled, the latter to those which are not bridled. Who dreams of the name "Huna," a miracle will be wrought for him[1] ; of "Hannina, Hananya, Johanan," miracles will be wrought for him. Who dreams of a Hasped[2], from Heaven will pity and redemption be vouchsafed him. This only applies [to him who sees in his dream the word Hesped] in writing[3]. [Who dreams] that he makes the response "May His great name be blessed" is assured that he is a son of the world to come. [Who dreams] that he recites the Shema' is meet that the Shekinah should rest upon him[4], but his generation is not worthy of it. Who dreams that he lays the Tefillin may hope for greatness ; as it is said, "And all the peoples of the earth shall see that the name of the Lord is called upon thee, and they shall fear thee" (Deut. xxviii. 10)[5]; and there is a teaching : R. Eliezer the Great says : This refers to the Tefillin worn on the head. Who dreams that he is saying the Tefillah, it is a good omen for him ; but this applies only when he does not conclude it[6]. 

Who dreams of having intercourse with his mother may hope for understanding[7]; as it is said, "Yea, thou wilt call understanding 'mother'" (Prov. ii. 3)[8]. [Who dreams] of having intercourse with a betrothed maiden may hope for Torah, as it is said, "Moses commanded us a law [Torah], an inheritance of the congregation of Jacob" (Deut. xxxiii. 4) — read not morashah "an inheritance" but me'orasah "betrothed maiden." Who dreams of having had intercourse with his sister may hope for wisdom ; as it is said, "Say unto wisdom, thou art my sister" (Prov. vii. 4). Who dreams of having had intercourse with a married woman is assured that he is a son of the world to come ; but this applies only if he was not acquainted with her and did not think of her during the evening. 

R. Hiyya b. Abba said[1] : Who dreams of wheat will see peace ; as it is said, "He maketh thy borders peace ; He giveth thee in plenty the fat of wheat" (Ps. cxlvii. 14). Who dreams of barley, his iniquities will depart[2]; as it is said, "Thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin expiated" (Is. vi. 7). R. Zera said : I never went up from Babylon to the Land of Israel without dreaming of barley[3]. Who dreams of a well-laden vine, his wife will not miscarry ; as it is said, "Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine" (Ps. cxxviii. 3). [Who dreams] of a choice vine may hope for the Messiah ; as it is said, "Binding his foal unto the vine and his ass' colt unto the choice vine" (Gen. xlix. 11)[4]. Who dreams of the fig, his Torah will be preserved within him ; as it is said, "Whoso keepeth the fig-tree shall eat the fruit thereof" (Prov. xxvii. 18)[5]. Who dreams of pomegranates, if small, his business will bear fruit like the pomegranate ; if large, his business will grow like the pomegranate ; if split open, should he be a disciple of the wise, he may hope for Torah ; as it is said, "I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine, of the juice of my pomegranate" (Cant. viii. 2); but should he be an 'Am ha'ares, he may hope for commandments [to perform], as it is said, "Thy temples [rakkah] are like a pomegranate split open" (ibid. iv. 3). What means rakkah? Even the illiterate [rekanim] amongst thee will be full of commandments as a pomegranate [is full of seeds]. Who dreams of olives, if small, his business will be fruitful and multiply and endure like olives. But this applies only to [dreaming of] the fruit ; if [he dreamt] of olive-trees, then he will have numerous offspring; as it is said, "Thy children like olive-plants, round about thy table" (Ps. cxxviii. 3). Some say that he who dreams of the olive, a good name will proceed from him; as it is said, "The Lord called thy name a leafy olive-tree, fair and goodly fruit" (Jer. xi. 16). Who dreams of olive-oil may hope for the light of Torah ; as it is said, "That they bring unto thee pure olive-oil beaten for the light" (Exod. xxvii. 20). Who dreams of palms, his iniquities will be ended[1]; as it is said, "The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion" (Lam. iv. 22). 

Rab Joseph said : Who dreams of a goat, the year will be blessed for him; of goats, years will be blessed for him ; as it is said, "And there will be goat's milk enough for thy food" (Prov. xxvii. 27). Who dreams of the myrtle[2], his business undertakings will prosper ; and if he has no business undertakings, an inheritance will fall to his lot from some other place. 'Ulla said (another version : It was taught in a Baraita) : This only applies when he sees [the myrtle] on its stem. Who dreams of a citron, will be honoured before his Maker; as it is said, "The fruit of goodly trees, branches of palm-trees" (Lev. xxiii. 40). Who dreams of a palm-branch has but one heart for his Father in Heaven. Who dreams of a goose may hope for wisdom[3]; as it is said, "Wisdom crieth aloud in the street" (Prov. i. 20); and he who [dreams of having] intercourse with it will become the Principal of a Seminary. Rab Ashe said : I dreamt of seeing one and having intercourse with it, and I ascended to greatness[4]. Who dreams of a cock may hope for a son, of cocks may hope for sons, of hens[5] may hope for a beautiful rearing [of his children] and rejoicing. Who dreams of eggs, his petition remains in suspense[6] ; if broken, his petition has been granted. Similarly is it with nuts and cucumbers and all glass vessels and all such breakable articles. [Who dreams] that he entered a town, his desires will be fulfilled for him ; as it is said, "And He led them unto their desired haven" (Ps. cvii. 30). Who dreams of shaving his head, it is a good omen for him" ; [of shaving] his head and beard, [it is a good omen] for him and all his family. [Who dreams] that he is sitting in a small boat, a good name will proceed from him ; if in a big boat, then from him and all his family ; but that only applies when it is sailing high on the seas. Who dreams that he is performing the functions of nature, it is a good omen for him ; as it is said, "He that is bent down shall speedily be loosed[1]" (ls li. 14). But that only applies if he does not [dream of] wiping himself. Who dreams of ascending to the roof will ascend to greatness ; of descending, he will descend from greatness. Abbai and Raba both say : Since he has ascended, he has ascended[2]. Who dreams of rending his garments, the Divine decree will be rent for him. Who dreams of standing naked, if in Babylon he will stand without sin ; but if in the Land of Israel, [he will stand] naked without commandments[3]. Who dreams that he has been arrested by the police[4], the Divine protection will be vouchsafed him. [If he dreamt] that they placed him in neck-chains[5], the Divine protection will be doubly vouchsafed him ; but this applies only to a neck-chain, not to a common cord. Who dreams of walking into a pool[6] will be appointed Principal of a Seminary ; into a forest[7], he will be made the head of the Collegiates. 

Rab Pappa and Rab Huna b. Rab Joshua had a dream. Rab Pappa [dreamt that he] walked into a pool and was appointed the Principal of a Seminary, and Rab Huna b. Rab Joshua that he walked into a forest and was made the head of the Collegiates. Another version is : They both [dreamt that they] walked into a pool; but Rab Pappa, who was wearing a drum[8] around his neck, was made Principal of the Seminary, whereas Rab Huna b. Rab Joshua, who had no drum around his neck, was made the head of the Collegiates. Rab Ashe said : I [once dreamt that I] walked into a pool, with a drum around my neck, and I made a noise therewith[9]. 

A Tanna taught in the presence of Rab Nahman b. Isaac[1] : Who dreams of blood-letting, his sins will be pardoned him[2]. But there is a teaching : His sins are set in order for him ! What means "set in order"? Set in order so as to be pardoned. 

A Tanna taught in the presence of Rab Sheshet ; Who dreams of a serpent, his sustenance will be provided him ; if it bit him, his sustenance will be doubled for him ; if he killed it, his sustenance is lost. Rab Sheshet said to him : [When he dreams of killing the serpent], how much more likely is it that his sustenance will be doubled ! But it is not so ; and it was Rab Sheshet who dreamt that he saw a serpent and killed it[3]. 

A Tanna taught in the presence of R. Johanan[4] : To dream of any kind of liquids is a good omen, with the exception of wine. Some [dream they] drink it and it is a good omen for them, and some do so and it is a bad omen for them. There are some who [dream they] drink it and it is a good omen for them, as it is said, "Wine that maketh glad the heart of man" (Ps. civ. 15); and there are some who [dream they] drink it and it is a bad omen for them, as it is said, "Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto the bitter in soul" (Prov. xxxi. 6). R. Johanan said to the Tanna : Teach that in the case of a disciple of the wise, it is always a good omen ; as it is said, "Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled" (ibid, ix. 5). 

[[fol. 57 b.]] R. Johanan said : If one wakes up and a verse comes to his mouth, it is to be regarded as a minor prophecy[5].
 
Our Rabbis have taught : There are three kings [to dream of whom has significance]. Who dreams of David may hope for piety ; of Solomon, may hope for wisdom ; of Ahab, he should be concerned about punishment. There are three prophets [to dream of whom has significance]. (Who dreams of the Book of Kings may hope for greatness;)[6] of Ezekiel, may hope for wisdom ; of Isaiah, may hope for consolation ; of Jeremiah, he should be concerned about punishment. There are three major books of the Hagiographa [to dream of which has significance]. Who dreams of the Book of Psalms may hope for piety ; of Proverbs, may hope for wisdom ; of Job, he should be concerned about punishment. There are three minor books of the Hagiographa [to dream of which has significance]. Who dreams of the Song of Songs may hope for piety ; of Ecclesiastes, may hope for wisdom ; of Lamentations, he should be concerned about punishment ; and he who dreams of the Scroll of Esther, a miracle will be wrought for him. There are three Sages [to dream of whom has significance]. Who dreams of Rabbi[1] may hope for wisdom ; of R. Eleazar b. 'Azariah[2], may hope for wealth ; of Ishmael b. Elisha[3], he should be concerned about punishment. There are three disciples of the wise[4] [to dream of whom has significance]. Who dreams of Ben 'Azzai[5] may hope for piety ; of Ben Zoma, may hope for wisdom ; of Aher[6], he should be concerned about punishment. 

To dream of any species of animal is a good omen with the exception of the elephant, monkey and long-tailed ape[7]. But a teacher has said : Who dreams of an elephant, a miracle will be wrought for him ! There is no contradiction ; the latter refers to where it is bridled and the other to where it is not bridled[8]. To dream of any kind of metal-tool is a good omen, with the exception of the hoe, the mattock and the axe ; but this applies only when he sees them with their handles. To dream of any kind of fruit is a good omen with the exception of unripe dates. To dream of any kind of vegetables is a good omen with the exception of turnipheads. But Rab[9] said : I did not become rich until I dreamt of turnip-heads ! When he saw them, he saw them on their stem. To dream of any kind of colour is a good omen with the exception of blue. To dream of any kind of birds is a good omen with the exception of the owl, the horned owl and the bat[10]. 

(The body; The body ; Essence; Restore; Enlarge — mnemonic[11].) 

Three things enter the body without its deriving any benefit therefrom ; melilot[1], date-berries and unripe dates. Three things do not enter the body, but it derives benefit therefrom : washing, anointing and regular motions [tashmish]. Three things are of the essence of the world to come : the Sabbath, the sun and tashmish. Tashmish of what? Are we to suppose tashmish of the bed[2]? That weakens ! No ; tashmish of the orifices. Three things restore a man's [tranquillity of] mind : melodious sound, sight and smell. Three things enlarge a man's mind[3]: a beautiful home, a beautiful woman and beautiful utensils. 

(Five and six and ten — mnemonic.) 

Five things are a sixtieth part of something else : fire, honey, the Sabbath, sleep and a dream. Fire is a sixtieth part of Gehinnom; honey a sixtieth of manna ; the Sabbath a sixtieth of the world to come ; sleep a sixtieth of death ; a dream the sixtieth of prophecy. 

Six things are a favourable symptom in an invalid : sneezing, perspiration, abdominal motion, seminal emission, sleep and a dream. "Sneezing" — for it is written, "His sneezings flash forth light" (Job xli. 10). "Perspiration" — for it is written, "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread" (Gen, iii. 19). "Abdominal motion" — for it is written, "He that is bent down shall speedily be loosed ; and he shall not go down dying into the pit" (Is. li. 14). "Seminal emission" — for it is written, "Seeing seed, he will prolong his days" (ibid. liii. 10). "Sleep" — for it is written, "I should have slept, then had I been at rest" (Job iii. 13). "A dream" — for it is written, "Thou didst cause me to dream[4] and make me to live" (Is. xxxviii. 16). 

Six things cure an invalid from his sickness and their remedy is an [efficacious] remedy, viz. : cabbage, beet, a decoction of dried poley, the maw, the womb and the large lobe of the liver[5]. Some add : Also small fish ; more than that, small fish make a man's whole body fruitful and strong[6]. 

Ten things cause an invalid to relapse and his sickness becomes worse, viz. : to eat the flesh of the ox, fat meat, roast meat, poultry, roasted egg ; also shaving, and partaking of cress, milk, cheese ; and bathing. Some add: Also nuts; others add: Also cucumbers. 

The school of R. Ishmael taught : Why are they called "cucumbers" [kishshuim] ? Because they are injurious [kashim] to the body like swords. But it is not so ! For lo, it is written, "And the Lord said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb" (Gen. xxv. 23) — read not goyim "nations," but geim "lords"; and Rab Judah said in the name of Rab: These are Antoninus and Rabbi[1] from whose table radish, lettuce and cucumbers were never absent either in Summer or Winter ! There is no contradiction ; the large ones [are injurious], the small ones [beneficial]. 

Our Rabbis have taught : [If one dreams] there is a corpse in the house, there will be peace in the house ; that he was eating and drinking in the house, it is an auspicious omen for the house ; that he took a vessel from the house, it is an inauspicious omen for the house. Rab Pappa explained [the "vessel" to refer to] a shoe or sandal. Everything that the corpse takes away [if seen in a dream] is auspicious with the exception of a shoe or sandal[2]; and everything that the corpse gives is auspicious with the exception of dust and mustard[3]. 

[He who beholds] a place from which idolatry has been uprooted. 

Our Rabbis have taught : (Who sees a statue of Hermes says, "Blessed... Who hast shown long-suffering to those who transgress Thy will[4]"), [If he sees] a place from which idolatry has been uprooted, he should say, "Blessed... Who hast uprooted idolatry from our land ; and as it has been uprooted from this place, so may it be uprooted from all places of Israel. And do Thou turn the heart of those who serve idols to serve Thee." But if this is outside the Land [of Israel], it is unnecessary to say "And do Thou turn the heart of those who serve idols to serve Thee," because most of them are gentiles. R. Simeon b. Eleazar said : The benediction should also be uttered outside the Land, because they will in the future become converted ; as it is said, "For then will I turn to the peoples a pure language" (Zeph. iii. 9). 

Rab Hamnuna expounded : Who sees the wicked Babylon should utter five benedictions. If he sees Babylon, he says "Blessed... Who hast destroyed wicked Babylon." If he sees the palace of Nebuchadnezzar, he says "Blessed...Who hast destroyed the palace of Nebuchadnezzar." If he sees the den of lions or the fiery furnace, he says "Blessed ...Who hast performed miracles for our fathers in this place." If he sees a statue of Hermes, he says "Blessed... Who hast shown long-suffering to those who transgress Thy will." If he sees a place [in Babylon] from which dust is being taken away[1], he says "Blessed...Who sayest and doest, Who doth decree and fulfil." When Raba saw asses carrying this dust, he struck them upon the back with his hand and exclaimed, "Run, ye righteous, to perform the will of your Master." When Mar b. Rabina came to Babylon, he took up some earth in his mantle and cast it out, to fulfil that which was said, "I will sweep it with the besom of destruction" (Is. xiv. 23). Rab Ashe said : I had not heard that of Rab Hamnuna, but from my own mind I said all those benedictions. 

[[fol. 58 a.]] R. Jeremiah b. Eleazar said : When Babylon was cursed, her neighbours were cursed ; but when Samaria was cursed, her neighbours were blessed. When Babylon was cursed, her neighbours were cursed ; for it is written, "I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of water" (ibid.)[2]. When Samaria was cursed, her neighbours were blessed ; for it is written, "Therefore I will make Samaria a heap in the field, a place for the planting of vineyards" (Micah i. 6). 

Rab Hamnuna also said : Who beholds crowds of Israelites should say "Blessed... Who art wise in secrets[3]"; but [on beholding] crowds of idolaters he says, "Your mother shall be ashamed" etc. (Jer. 1. 12). The Rabbis have taught : Who sees crowds of Israelites should say "Blessed... Who art wise in secrets," because their minds differ and their faces differ. Ben Zoma saw a crowd on top of the ascent of the Temple Mount and said, "Blessed... Who art wise in secrets, and blessed...Who hast created all these to serve me[4]." 

[Ben Zoma] used to say : How much labour Adam must have expended before he obtained bread to eat ! He ploughed, sowed, reaped, piled up the sheaves, threshed, winnowed, selected [the ears], ground, sifted [the flour], kneaded and baked, and after that he ate ; whereas I get up in the morning and find all this prepared for me. And how much labour must Adam have expended before he obtained a garment to wear ! He sheared, washed [the wool], combed, spun, wove, and after that he obtained a garment to wear ; whereas I get up in the morning and find all this prepared for me. All artisans[1] attend and come to the door of my house, and I get up and find all these things before me. 

He used to declare : What does a good guest say ? "How much trouble has my host taken on my behalf ! How much meat he set before me ! How much wine he set before me ! How many cakes he set before me ! And all the trouble he took was only for my sake." But what does the bad guest say ? "What trouble has my host taken ? I ate one piece of bread ; I ate one slice of meat ; I drank one cup of wine; and whatever trouble my host experienced was only for the sake of his wife and children." What does one say concerning a good guest ? "Remember that thou magnify his work, whereof men have sung" (Job xxxvi. 24) ; and of a bad guest it is written, "Men do therefore fear him ; he regardeth not any that are wise of heart" (ibid. xxxvii 24). 

"And the man was an old man in the days of Saul, stricken in years among men" (I Sam. xvii. 12). Raba (other versions : Rab Zebid, Rab Osha'ya)[2] said : This refers to Jesse, the father of David, who went out with a crowd, came in with a crowd and expounded [Torah] with a crowd. 'Ulla said : We have received a tradition that there is no crowd in Babylon. It has been taught : A crowd must not consist of less than sixty myriads. 

Our Rabbis have taught : Who beholds the Sages of Israel should say, "Blessed... Who hast imparted of Thy wisdom to them that fear Thee" ; but [on beholding] the wise men of other peoples, he says "Blessed... Who hast given of Thy wisdom to Thy creatures[3]." Who beholds the kings of Israel should say, "Blessed... Who hast imparted of Thy glory to them that fear Thee"; but [on beholding] the kings of other peoples he says, "Blessed... Who hast imparted of Thy glory to Thy creatures[3]." R. Johanan said : A man should always bestir himself to run to meet the kings of Israel ; and not only the kings of Israel, but even to meet the kings of other peoples, for if he is worthy, he will distinguish between the kings of Israel and of other peoples[4]. 

Rab Sheshet was blind. Everybody went to greet a king, and Rab Sheshet arose and went with them. A certain Min met him and said, "Pitchers [go] to the river, where [go] the potsherds[1]?" He replied, "Come, see how I know things better than thou[2]." The first troop of soldiers passed by, and when a shout arose, the Min said to him, "Now the king is coming." Rab Sheshet answered, "He is not coming yet." A second troop passed, and when a shout arose, the Min said to him, "Now the king is coming." Rab Sheshet answered, "He is not coming." A third troop passed, and while there was silence, Rab Sheshet said to him, "Now certainly the king is coming." The Min asked him, "Whence hast thou this?" He replied, "Earthly kingship is like the Kingship of Heaven, of which it is written, 'Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the Lord. And behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and broke in pieces the rocks before the Lord ; but the Lord was not in the wind ; and after the wind an earthquake ; but the Lord was not in the earthquake ; and after the earthquake a fire ; but the Lord was not in the fire ; and after the fire a still small voice' (I Kings xix. 11f.)." When the king arrived, Rab Sheshet began and uttered the benediction for him. The Min said to him, "For one whom thou seest not thou dost pronounce a benediction!" And what happened to that Min? Some say that his associates put his eyes out ; others declare that Rab Sheshet set his eyes upon him and he became a heap of bones. 

R. Shela flogged a certain man who had had intercourse with a gentile[3] woman ; so he went and laid a charge against him before the king, saying, "There is a certain Jew who judges without the king's consent." The king sent an official for him [to appear]. When R. Shela came he was asked, "For what reason didst thou flog this person?" He replied, "Because he had intercourse with a she-ass." They said to him, "Hast thou witnesses?" He answered, "Yes." Elijah[4] came in human guise and gave evidence. They said to him, "In that case, his punishment is death." He said to them, "From the day we were exiled from our land, we have no power to inflict the death-sentence ; but you do with him as you please." While they were considering the case, R. Shela commenced saying, "Thine, O Lord, is the greatness and the power" etc. (I Chron. xxix. 11). They asked him, "What is it thou art saying?" He replied, "I am saying, 'Blessed be the All-merciful Who has made earthly kingship like the Kingship of Heaven and has given you power and love of justice'." They said, "The honour of the kingship is very dear to him." They thereupon handed to him the staff[1] and said to him, "Do thou act as judge." When he went out, the man said to him, "Does the All-merciful perform a miracle for such liars!" He replied, "Thou evil-doer ! Are not they called 'asses'? For it is written, 'Whose flesh is as the flesh of asses' (Ezek. xxiii. 20)." 

[R. Shela] perceived that the man was going to tell them that he called them asses. He said [to himself], "That man is a pursuer, and the Torah has stated, If one seeks to kill thee, do thou kill him first[2]" ; so he smote him with the staff and killed him. He then said, "Since a miracle was wrought for me with this verse, I will expound it." [He went to the House of Study and expounded][3]: "Thine, O Lord, is the greatness" — that refers to the work of Creation ; for so it is stated, "Who doeth great things past finding out" (Job ix. 10). "And the power" — that refers to the Exodus from Egypt ; as it is said, "And Israel saw the great work" etc. (Exod. xiv. 31). "And the glory" — that refers to the sun and moon which stood still for Joshua; as it is said, "And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed" (Josh. x. 13). "And the victory" [nesah] — that refers to the overthrow of Rome[4]; for so it is stated, "And their life-blood [nesah] is dashed against My garments" (Is. Ixiii. 3). "And the majesty" — that refers to the battle at the valleys of Arnon ; as it is said, "Wherefore it is said in the book of the Wars of the Lord : Vaheb in Suphah, and the valleys of Arnon" (Num. xxi. 14)[5]. "For all that is in heaven and earth" — that refers to the war of Sisera ; as it is said, "They fought from heaven, the stars in their courses fought against Sisera" (Judges V. 20). "Thine is the kingdom, O Lord" — that refers to the war of Amalek ; for so it is stated, "The hand upon the throne of the Lord, the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation" (Exod. xvii. 16). "And Thou art exalted" — that refers to the war of Gog and Magog[1] ; for so it is stated, "Behold I am against thee, O Gog, chief prince of Meshech and Tubal" (Ezek. xxxviii. 3). "As head above all" — Rab Hanan b. Raba said in the name of Rab[2] : Even the waterman[3] is appointed by Heaven. In a Baraita it is taught in the name of R. 'Akiba : "Thine, O Lord, is the greatness" — that refers to the division of the Red Sea. "And the power" — that refers to the smiting of the first-born. "And the glory" — that refers to the giving of the Torah, "And the victory" — that refers to Jerusalem. "And the majesty" — that refers to the Temple. 

[[fol. 58 b.]]Our Rabbis have taught : Who sees the houses of Israelites when inhabited says, "Blessed... Who dost set the boundary of the widow[4]" ; [but when he sees them] in ruins he says, "Blessed be the true Judge." [Who beholds] the houses of idolaters when they are inhabited says, "The Lord will pluck up the house of the proud" (Prov. xv. 25); [but when he sees them] in ruins he says, "O Lord, Thou God, to Whom vengeance belongeth. Thou God to Whom vengeance belongeth, shine forth" (Ps. xciv. 1 ). 

'Ulla and Rab Hisda were journeying along the road. When they reached the entrance of the house of Rab Hanna b. Hanilai, Rab Hisda broke down and sighed. 'Ulla asked him, "Why dost thou sigh? For lo, Rab has said : A sigh breaketh half the body of a man ; as it is said, 'Sigh therefore, thou son of man, with the breaking of thy loins,' etc. (Ezek. xxi. 11); and R. Johanan[5] has said : It even breaks the whole body ; as it is said, 'And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou ? that thou shalt say, Because of the tidings, for it cometh ; and every heart shall melt' etc. (ibid. v. 12)." He answered him, "How should I not sigh [on beholding] a house in which there were sixty[6] cooks by day and sixty cooks by night and they baked for each person what he desired. Nor did he[7] ever take his hand away from his purse, thinking that perhaps there may come a poor man, the son of respectable people, and while he is reaching for his purse, he would be put to shame. Moreover it had four doors open to the four directions, and whoever entered hungry came out sated. He used also to cast wheat and barley outside during the years of drought, so that anybody who was ashamed to take it by day came and took it by night. And now that it is fallen into ruins, shall I not sigh?" He said to him, "Thus spake R. Johanan : From the day the Temple was destroyed, a decree was issued that the houses of the righteous should be destroyed ; as it is said, 'In mine ears said the Lord of hosts : Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant' (Is. v. 9). Also said R. Johanan[1]: The Holy One, blessed be He, will restore them to habitation ; as it is said, 'A Song of Ascents. They that trust in the Lord are as Mount Zion' (Ps. cxxv. 1) — just as the Holy One, blessed be He, will restore Mount Zion to habitation, so will He restore the houses of the righteous to habitation." He perceived that his mind was still not at rest, so he said to him, "It is enough for the slave to be like his master[2]." 

Our Rabbis have taught: "Who beholds the graves of Israel says[3]: "Blessed... Who formed you in judgment, Who nourished you in judgment, sustained you in judgment, and gathered you in judgment, and will hereafter raise you in judgment." Mar b. Rabina concluded the benediction in the name of Rab Nahman[4] : "And knowest the number of you all in judgment, and will hereafter restore you to life and cause you to survive. Blessed... Who quickenest the dead." [Who beholds] the graves of idolaters says, "Your mother shall be sore ashamed" (Jer. 1. 12). 

R. Joshua b. Levi said : Who sees his friend after [an interval of] thirty days says, "Blessed... Who hast kept us in life, and hast preserved us, and enabled us to reach this season." After [an interval of] twelve months he says, "Blessed... Who quickenest the dead." Rab said : The dead is only forgotten from the heart after twelve months[5] ; as it is said, "I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind ; I am like a lost vessel" (Ps. xxxi. 13)[6]. 

Rab Pappa and Rab Huna b. Rab Joshua were journeying along the road and met Rab Hannina b. Rab Ika. They said to him, "Since we have seen thee, we will offer two benedictions on thine account : 'Blessed... Who impartest Thy wisdom to them that fear Thee' and 'Blessed... Who hast kept us in life' etc." He replied, "I also, since I have seen you, deem you to be in my eyes like the sixty myriads of the house of Israel and say three benedictions on your account : the two you have uttered and also 'Blessed... Who art wise in secrets[1]'. " They said to him, "Art thou as wise as all that?" They set their eyes on him and he died[2]. 

R. Joshua b. Levi said : Who beholds men smitten with a leprous eruption says, "Blessed... Who variest the forms of Thy creatures." It is quoted in objection : Who beholds a negro, a red-spotted or white-spotted person, a hunchback, dwarfed or dropsical person says, "Blessed... Who variest the forms of Thy creatures" ; but [on beholding] a person with an amputated limb, or blind, or flat-headed, or lame, or smitten with boils or a leprous eruption he says, "Blessed be the true Judge" ! There is no contradiction ; the former refers to one suffering thus from his mother's womb, the other to one suffering thus after birth. This is also proved from the fact that he teaches that [the man afflicted with leprous eruption] is like the person with an amputated limb[3]. Deduce from this [that the leper referred to in the Baraita is one who became diseased after birth]. 

Our Rabbis have taught : Who beholds an elephant, or monkey or long-tailed ape says, "Blessed... Who variest the forms of Thy creatures[4]." If he beholds beautiful works of creation and fine trees he says, "Blessed... to Whom it is thus in Thy universe." 

II. For shooting stars [Zikin]. 

What means Zikin ? Samuel said : Kokeba di-Shebit[5]. Samuel also said : The paths of heaven are as familiar to me as the streets of Nehardea[1], with the exception of the Kokeba di-Shebit, for I know not what that is. There is a tradition that it never passes through the constellation of Orion, for if it did the world would he destroyed. But we see that it does pass through ! It is its brightness that passes through, and so it seems as though it does actually pass through. Rab Huna b. Rab Joshua[2] said ; It is the Veil [ Vilon] which is rent and rolled up, so that the light of the heaven [Rekia'] appears[3]. Rab Ashe said : A star disappears from one side of Orion and [the beholder] sees a companion star [appear] on the other side and is bewildered ; and thus it seems as though it had passed through [the constellation][4]. 

Samuel asked : It is written "Who maketh the Bear, Orion and the Pleiades" (Job ix. 9) and it is written "That maketh the Pleiades and Orion" (Amos v. 8) ! How is that[5] ? Were it not for the heat of Orion, the world could not exist because of the coldness of the Pleiades, and were it not for the coldness of the Pleiades, the world could not exist because of the heat of Orion[6]. There is also a tradition : Were it not that the tail of the Scorpion was placed in the Fire-River[7], nobody who had been stung by a scorpion could live. That is what the All-merciful said to Job, "Canst thou bind the chains of the Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?" (Job xxxviii. 31). 

What means Kimah [the Pleiades]? Samuel said : About a hundred [Keme'ah] stars ; some say : Which are gathered together, but others say : Which are scattered. What means 'Ash [the Bear]? Rab Judah said : Juta[8]. What is Juta? Some say : The tail of a ram ; others say : The head of a calf. But the more probable view is that of him who said, "The tail of a ram" ; for it is written, "And the 'Ajish will be comforted for her children" (ibid. V. 32)[9]. Hence it seems as if something is lacking [in the tail] [[fol. 59 a.]] it has the appearance of having been torn away [from the star] ; and the reason that the 'Ajish follows the Kimah is that it says to it, "Give me back my children." For when the Holy One, blessed be He, sought to bring the flood upon the world. He took two stars from the Pleiades[1] and thus brought the flood upon the world ; and when He sought to stop it, He took two stars from the Bear and stopped it. But He should have restored [the original stars]! "A pit cannot be filled with its own clods[2]"; or also, "An accuser cannot become a defender[3]." Then He should have created two other stars ! "There is nothing new under the sun" (Eccles. i. 9). Rab Nahman said : The Holy One, blessed be He, will hereafter restore them; as it is said, "And the 'Ajish will be comforted for her children." 

And for earthquakes. 

What is an earthquake? Rab Kattina said : A subterranean rumbling. Rab Kattina was journeying by the way, and when he reached the entrance of the house of a necromancer a rumbling noise broke forth. He said, "Does the necromancer know what this rumbling is?" The latter called to him, "Kattina, Kattina ! Why should I not know? When the Holy One, blessed be He, remembers His children who dwell in misery among the nations of the world. He causes two tears to descend to the Ocean, and the sound is heard from one end of the world to the other ; and that is the rumbling." Rab Kattina said, "The necromancer lies and his words are false; for in that case, there should be one rumbling noise followed by another[4]!" But it is not so ; there is really one rumbling noise followed by another, and the reason that Kattina did not acknowledge the necromancer's statement was that people should not be led astray after him. Rab Kattina himself explained [that the phenomenon was due to God] clapping His hands ; as it is said, "I will also smite My hands together, and I will satisfy My fury" (Ezek. xxi. 22). R. Nathan says : The rumbling is due to His sighing; as it is said, "I will satisfy My fury upon them, and I will be eased" (ibid. v. 13). The Rabbis say : He treads upon the firmament ; as it is said, "He giveth a noise, as they that tread grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth" (Jer. xxv. 30). Rab Aha b. Jacob[5] said : He presses His feet beneath the Throne of Glory ; as it is said, "Thus saith the Lord, the heaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool" (Is. Ixvi. 1). 

And for thunders. 
What is thunder? Samuel said : The clouds in a whirl ; as it is said, "The voice of Thy thunder was in the whirlwind ; the lightnings lighted up the world, the earth trembled and shook" (Ps. Ixxvii. 19). The Rabbis say[1] : The clouds pouring water one into the other; as it is said, "At the sound of His giving a multitude of waters in the heavens" (Jer. x. 13). Rab Aha b. Jacob said : It is a mighty lightning-flash which strikes against a cloud and the latter is shattered into hail-stones. Rab Ashe said : The clouds are hollow[2] and a blast of wind comes and blows across their mouths, so it is like a blast across the mouth of a jar. The most probable view is that of Rab Aha b. Jacob, that the lightning strikes, the clouds are made to rumble and rain descends. 

And for storms. 
What is a storm? Abbai said : A hurricane ; and further said Abbai : There is a tradition that a hurricane never happens during the night. But we have seen it occurring ! It must have commenced in the daytime. Abbai likewise said: There is a tradition that a hurricane does not last two hours; to fulfil that which was said, "Trouble shall not rise up the second time" (Nahum i. 9). But we have seen it lasting [longer than that]! It stopped in between[3]. 

For lightnings one says, "Blessed... Whose strength and might fill the world." 

What is lightning? Raba said : A flash. Also said Raba[4]: A single flash, a white flash, a green flash, and clouds which rise in the western corner and come from the south corner, and two clouds which rise one opposite the other, are all inauspicious. What is to be deduced therefrom? That one should offer supplication. This applies only to the night[5], but in the morning there is no significance in them. Rab Samuel b. Isaac said : There is no significance in morning-clouds ; for it is written, "Your goodness is as a morning cloud" (Hosea vi. 4). Rab Pappa[6] said to Abbai : But there is a proverbial expression, "If on opening the door [in the morning] there is rain, set down thy sack, O ass-driver, and lie on it[1]"! There is no contradiction ; for this refers to [a sky] covered with heavy clouds, whereas the former refers to [a sky] covered with light clouds. 

R. Alexander said in the name of R. Joshua b. Levi : Thunder was only created to break the pride of the heart ; as it is said, "God hath so made it that men should fear before Him" (Eccles. iii. 14). Also said R. Alexander in the nanie of R.[2]Joshua b. Levi : Who sees the rainbow should prostrate himself upon his face; as it is said, "As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud...and when I saw it, I fell upon my face" (Ezek. i. 28). In the West[3] they curse one who acts thus, because it has the appearance as though he worships the rainbow ; but he should certainly pronounce a benediction. What is the benediction ? "Blessed. ..Who remembrest the Covenant." It has been taught in a Baraita : R. Ishmael, the son of R. Johanan b. Baroka says: [The benediction is, "Blessed...] Who art faithful with Thy Covenant and fulfillest Thy word." Rab Pappa said: Let us therefore say both : "Blessed ... Who remembrest the Covenant, art faithful with Thy Covenant and fulfillest Thy word." 

For mountains and hills...he says, "Blessed...Who hast made the Creation." 

Is it then to be supposed that all the other things hitherto mentioned do not belong to the work of Creation? For lo, it is written, "He maketh[4] lightnings for the rain" (Ps. cxxxv. 7)! Abbai said : Connect them all and learn them together[5]. Raba said : In the former instances he pronounces two benedictions : "Blessed...Whose strength fills the world and Who hast made the Creation" ; but here "...Who hast made the Creation" is applicable, but "Whose strength fills the world" is not applicable[6]. 

R. Joshua b. Levi said : Who sees the firmament in its purity[7] says, "Blessed... Who hast made the Creation." When is this? Abbai[8] said : When it has rained the whole night and in the morning a north wind comes and clears the sky[9]. This is at variance with the statement of Rafram b. Pappa who said in the name of Rab Hisda : Since the Temple was destroyed, the firmament has never been seen in its purity ; as it is said, "I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering" (Is. 1. 3). 

Our Rabbis have taught : He who sees the sun [starting] on its [[fol. 59 b.]] new circuit or the moon in its strength, or the stars in their courses, or the planets in their order says, "Blessed...Who hast made the Creation." And when is it [that the sun starts on its new circuit]? Abbai said : Every twenty-eight years when the cycle begins again, and the Spring equinox falls in Saturn on the night of the third day of the week, which is the beginning of the fourth day[1]. 

R. Judah states : He who beholds the ocean says, "Blessed...Who hast made the ocean" but only when he beholds it at intervals. 

At intervals of what length? Rammi b. Abba said in the name of R. Issac : Of thirty days. Also said Rammi b. Abba in the name of R. Isaac : Who sees the Euphrates up to the Babylonian bridge says, "Blessed...Who hast made the Creation" ; but nowadays since the Persians have altered it[2], [that benediction is only to be said] from Be Shapor[3] onwards. Rab Joseph said : From Ihi Dekira[4] onwards. Further said Rammi b. Abba : Who sees the Tigris from the bridge of Shaporstan[5] says, "Blessed...Who hast made the Creation." 

Why [is the Tigris called] Hiddekel (Gen. ii. 14). Rab Ashe said : Its waters are sharp [had] and swift [kal][6]. Why [is the Euphrates called] Perat? Because its waters are fruitful [parah] and multiply. Rab said : The reason why the inhabitants of Mahoza[7] are so shrewd is because they drink the waters of the Tigris ; the reason why they are red-spotted is because they indulge in sexual intercourse in the daytime ; and the reason why their eyes are unsteady is because they dwell in dark houses[8]. For rain and good tidings he says, "Blessed... Who art good and dispensest good." 

But is the benediction for rain "Who art good and dispensest good"? For lo, R. Abbahu has said (another version : It was taught in a Baraita) : From what time do we say the benediction over rain ? From the time the bridegroom goes forth to meet his bride[1] ; and what is the wording of the benediction ? Rab Judah said : "We give thanks unto Thee for every drop which Thou hast caused to descend for us" ; and R. Johanan concluded it thus : "Though our mouths were full of song as the sea... we could not sufficiently thank Thee, O Lord our God" etc. until "shall prostrate itself before Thee[2]. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, to Whom abundant thanksgivings are due." Is it "abundant thanksgivings" and not "all thanksgivings"? Raba declared: I say "God of thanks-givings." Rab Pappa said : Let us therefore say both : "Abundant thanksgivings and God of thanksgivings." Still there is a contradiction[3]! No, there is not; [the formula in the Mishnah] applies when he heard [that it had been raining], the other when he actually sees it. But if he heard [that it had been raining] it is good tidings, and our Mishnah states : For good tidings one says, "Blessed... Who art good and dispensest good[4]"! Nay, they both refer to when he actually sees it ; and there is no contradiction, [the formula in the Mishnah] applying when little rain fell, the other when there was a heavy downpour. Or if thou wilt I can say that both refer to a heavy downpour ; and there is no contradiction, [the formula in the Mishnah] applying to a landowner[5], the other to one who is not. If he be a landowner, does he say the benediction "Who art good and dispensest good"? For lo, our Mishnah teaches : He who has built a new house or bought new vessels says, "Blessed... Who hast kept us in life, preserved us and caused us to reach this season." [If, however, the house had been built or the vessels bought] for himself and others, he says "Who art good and dispensest good[6]"! There is no contradiction; one refers to where there is a partnership, the other to where there is no partnership. And there is a teaching : The summary of the matter is : Over things of his own he says "Blessed... Who hast kept us in life and preserved us" etc. ; over things which belong to him and another he says "Blessed... Who art good and dispensest good." 

But in a case where there is not another [sharing] with him, does he not use the benediction "Who art good and dispensest good"? Lo, there is a teaching : Should they announce to him "Thy wife has given birth to a son," he says "Blessed... Who art good and dispensest good[1]" ! Even here, his wife [shares the joy] with him, because she has a preference for a son[2]. Come and hear : If his father dies and he is his heir, he first says, "Blessed be the true Judge" and then "Blessed... Who art good and dispensest good"! Here also there are brothers who share the inheritance with him[3]. Come and hear : If the wine is changed [for a better kind during the meal] there is no necessity to utter another benediction; but if he changed his place[4] [and other wine is brought to him] he should utter a further benediction ; and Rab Joseph b. Abba said in the name of R. Johanan[5] : Although it has been stated that if the wine is changed another benediction is unnecessary, still he says, "Blessed... Who art good and dispensest good" ! Here also there are the other members of the company who drink with him. 

III. He who has built a new house or bought new vessels, etc. 

Rab Huna said : This only applies if he has not similar vessels, but if he has similar vessels[6] there is no need for him to say a benediction. R. Johanan declared : Even if he has similar vessels, he must say the benediction. From this it is to be deduced that if he bought and then made a further purchase, all agree that there is no necessity for a benediction[7]. Another version : Rab [[fol. 60a.]] Huna said : This only applies where he did not buy and make a further purchase ; but if he bought and made a further purchase, there is no necessity for a benediction[1]. R. Johanan said : Even if he bought and made a further purchase, it is necessary to say the benediction. From this it is to be deduced that if he possesses vessels[2] and purchases more, all agree that he must say the benediction[3]. Against this is quoted : If he built a new house and he has not a similar one, or bought new vessels without possessing the like, he must say a benediction ; but if he has the like, he need not say the benediction. These are the words of R. Meir ; R. Judah says : In either case, a benediction is necessary ! It is quite right according to the first version ; for then Rab Huna agrees with R. Meir and R. Johanan with R. Judah. According to the latter version, however, it is right that Rab Huna agrees with R. Judah, but with whom is R. Johanan. in agreement[4]? Neither with R. Meir nor R. Judah[5]! R. Johanan can reply to thee : It is obvious that according to R. Judah, if a man made a purchase and then a fresh purchase, he also must say a benediction [for the latter][6]; but the point of variance [between R. Judah and R. Meir] is where the man already possessed the article[2] and made a fresh purchase, to show the extreme view taken by R. Meir; for even if he made a purchase, already possessing a similar article, there is no necessity for a benediction, how much more unnecessary is it if he purchased and then made a fresh purchase. But let the conflict of opinion [in the Baraita between R. Meir and R. Judah] be in the case where the man bought an article and then purchased another and no benediction is necessary[7], to show the extreme view taken by R. Judah[8]! It is preferable to take the extreme view on the side of leniency. 

One says the benediction for a calamity apart from any attendant good. 

How is this ? For instance, if a freshet swept his field[9], although it may be [eventually] beneficial inasmuch as the land is covered with alluvium and improves [in fertility], still for the time being it is a calamity. 

And for good fortune apart from any attendant evil. 

For instance, if he found treasure trove, although it is bad for him because the king will hear and deprive him thereof, still for the time being it is good for him. 

If his wife is pregnant and he says, "May it be Thy will that my wife bear a son," behold that is a vain prayer. 

Then prayer [in such circumstances] is of no avail ! Rab Joseph[1] quoted in objection : "And afterwards she bore a daughter and called her name Dinah" (Gen. xxx. 21). What means "and afterwards"? Rab said[2]: After Leah passed judgment on herself, saying, "Twelve tribes are destined to issue from Jacob — six have issued from me and four from the handmaids, that makes ten ; if this child [which is expected from me] be a male, my sister Rachel will not even be like one of the handmaids[3]." Immediately [the child in the womb] was changed to a daughter; as it is said, "And she called her name Dinah [judgment]"! We may not quote a miraculous event [against the Mishnah]. Or if thou wilt I can say that the incident of Leah occurred within forty days [of conception], according to the teaching : During the first three days [of the conjugal act] a man may pray that [his seed] should not become abortive ; from the third to the fortieth day he may pray that a male-child shall be born to him ; from the fortieth day to the third month he may pray that it should not be a monstrosity[4]; from the third to the sixth month he may pray that it should not be a premature birth ; from the sixth to the ninth month he may pray that it should issue in safety. But is it of any avail to pray [during the first forty days that it should be a male child]? For lo, R. Isaac b. R. Ammi[5] has said : If it is the man who first emits seed his wife bears a daughter ; but if the woman first emits seed she gives birth to a son ; as it is said, "If a woman emits seed[6] and bare a male child" (Lev. xii. 2)! With what are we here dealing ? For instance, if they both emit seed simultaneously. 

If he were on the way.

Our Rabbis have taught : It happened that Hillel the Elder was returning from a journey and heard a cry of lamentation in the city and said, "I am confident that it is not in my house" ; and to him the Scriptural verse applies, "He shall not be afraid of evil tidings ; his heart is steadfast, trusting in the Lord" (Ps cxii. 7). Raba[1] said : Whenever thou expoundest this verse, it is to be explained from the first clause to the second and from the second to the first. It is to be explained from the first clause to the second, thus : "He shall not be afraid of evil tidings." Why? "His heart is steadfast, trusting in the Lord." It is to be explained from the second clause to the first, thus : "His heart is steadfast, trusting in the Lord"; [therefore] "he shall not be afraid of evil tidings." 

A certain disciple was following R. Ishmael b. R. Jose in the market-place of Zion. The latter noticed that he was afraid and said to him, "Thou art a sinner; for it is written, 'The sinners in Zion are afraid' (Is. xxxiii. 14)." He replied, "But it is written, 'Happy is the man that feareth alway' (Prov. xxviii. 14)!" He said to him. "This is written in connection with words of Torah[2]." 

R. Judah b. R. Nathan took up [his cloak] and followed Rabbi in the market-place of Tiberias. The latter noticed that he was afraid and sighed ; so he said[3], "That fellow wants sufferings to befall him ; for it is written, 'For the thing which I did fear is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of hath overtaken me' (Job iii. 25)." [He replied,] "But lo, it is written, 'Happy is the man who feareth alway'!" "That is written in connection with words of Torah." 

IV. He who enters a town should offer prayer twice. 

Our Rabbis have taught : On entering, what does he say? "May it be Thy will, O Lord our God, that Thou cause me to enter this town in peace" Having entered, he says, "I give thanks before Thee, O Lord my God, for that Thou hast caused me to enter this town in peace." On desiring to depart, he says, "May it be Thy will, O Lord my God and God of my fathers, that Thou cause me to depart from this town in peace." Having left he says, "I give thanks before Thee, O Lord my God, for that Thou hast caused me to depart from this town in peace ; and as Thou hast caused me to depart in peace, so do Thou conduct me in peace, uphold me in peace, and direct my steps in peace, and deliver me from every enemy and ambush by the way. [Let me obtain grace, loving-kindness, and mercy in Thine eyes and in the eyes of all who behold me. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Who hearkenest unto prayer][1]." Rab Mattenah said : This prayer only applies to a town where they do not administer justice and sentence to death[2]; but in a town where they do administer justice and sentence to death, there is no need for such a petition. Another version is : Rab Mattenah said : Even in a town where they administer justice and sentence to death [the prayer is necessary] ; because sometimes there may not chance to be anybody to plead in his favour[3]. 

Our Rabbis have taught : Who enters a bath-house says, "May it be Thy will, O Lord my God, to deliver me from this and anything similar, and may no disgrace or iniquity befall me; but should any disgrace or iniquity befall me, may my death be an atonement for all my sins." Abbai said : Let not a man speak thus, so as not to open his mouth to Satan[4]. For said R. Simeon b. Lakish, and it has been similarly taught in the name of R. Jose : A man should never open his mouth to Satan. Rab Joseph said[5]: What is the Scriptural authority? For it is written, "We should have been as Sodom, we should have been like unto Gomorrah" (Is, i. 9). What did the prophet answer them? "Hear the word of the Lord, ye rulers of Sodom" (ibid. v. 10). When he leaves [the bathhouse], what does he say? R. Aha said[6] : "I give thanks before Thee, O Lord my God, because Thou hast delivered me from the fire." R. Abbahu entered a bath-house, and its floor gave way beneath him. A miracle occurred, and he stood upon a pillar and rescued a hundred and one men with one arm[7]. He exclaimed, 

"This is what R. Aha meant[8]." 

Who goes in to have himself cupped should say, "May it be Thy will, O Lord my God, that this operation be a cure for me, and do Thou heal me for Thou art a faithful Healer and Thy cure is certain, since it is not the way of human beings to cure, but thus are they accustomed[1]." Abbai declared : Let not a man speak thus ; for there is a teaching of the school of R. Ishmael : [It is written,] "Only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed" (Exod. xxi. 19) ; from this [it follows] that a physician is given permission [by God] to cure. When he rises [from the cupping], what does he say? R. Aha[2] declared, "Blessed be He Who heals without pay." 

[[fol. 60 b.]] Who enters a privy says[3], "Be honoured, ye honoured and holy Beings who minister to the Most High ! Give glory to the God of Israel ; leave me while I enter and do my will, then shall I come unto you." Abbai said : Let not a man speak thus[4], lest they leave him and depart; but let him say, "Guard me, guard me, help me, help me, support me, support me, wait for me, wait for me until I enter and come out, for such is the way of human beings." When he comes out, he says, "Blessed... Who hast formed man in wisdom and created in him many orifices and vessels. It is revealed and known before the throne of Thy glory, that if one of these be opened, or one of those closed, it would be impossible [to exist and][5] to stand before Thee." How is it to be concluded? Rab said, "[Blessed art Thou, O Lord,] Who healest the sick." Samuel said: Does Abba[6] regard the whole world as sick[7]? Nay, [the conclusion of the benediction should be : "Blessed...] Who healest all flesh." Rab Sheshet said : [It should conclude : "Blessed...] Who doest wondrously." Rab Pappa said : Let us therefore say both : "Who healest all flesh and doest wondrously." 

Who goes in to sleep upon his bed says from "Hear, O Israel" to "And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently" ; then he says[8] : "Blessed... Who makest the bands of sleep to fall upon mine eyes, and slumber upon mine eyelids, and givest light to the apple of the eye. May it be Thy will, O Lord my God, to suffer me to lie down in peace and place my portion in Thy Torah ; and do Thou accustom me to the performance of the commandments and not to transgression ; and bring me not into the power of sin, iniquity, temptation or contempt ; and let the good impulse have dominion over me but not the evil impulse ; and do Thou deliver me from evil occurrence and sore diseases ; and let not evil dreams and lustful thoughts trouble me; and let my bed be perfect before Thee, and give light to mine eyes lest I sleep the sleep of death. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Who givest light to the whole world in Thy glory." 

When he awakens he says : "O my God, the soul which Thou hast given me is pure. Thou didst create it within me, Thou didst breathe it into me, Thou preservest it within me, and Thou wilt take it from me, but wilt restore it unto me hereafter. So long as the soul is within me, I will give thanks unto Thee, O Lord my God and God of my fathers, Sovereign of all worlds, Lord of all souls. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Who restorest souls unto dead bodies[1]." 

When he hears the cry of the cock let him say : "Blessed...Who hast given the cock intelligence to distinguish between day and night[2]." When he opens his eyes let him say: "Blessed... Who openest the eyes of the blind." When he straightens himself and sits up let him say : "Blessed...Who loosest them that are bound." When he has clothed himself let him say : "Blessed... Who clothest the naked." When he raises himself let him say : "Blessed... Who raisest up them that are bowed down." When he descends [from the bed] to the ground let him say: "Blessed... Who spreadest forth the earth above the waters." When he walks let him say : "Blessed... Who hast made firm the steps of man." When he has tied up his shoes let him say: "Blessed... Who hast supplied my every want." When he has fastened his girdle let him say : "Blessed... Who girdest Israel with might." When he spreads the cloth upon his head let him say : "Blessed... Who crownest Israel with glory[3]." When he wraps himself with the Sisit let him say : "Blessed... Who hast sanctified us by Thy commandments and hast commanded us to enwrap ourselves in the fringed garment." When he places the Tefillin upon his arm let him say : "Blessed... Who hast sanctified us by Thy commandments, and hast commanded us to lay the Tefillin" ; upon the head let him say : "Blessed... Who hast sanctified us by Thy commandments, and hast commanded us concerning the precept of the Tefillin." When he has washed his hands let him say : "Blessed... Who hast sanctified us by Thy commandments and commanded us concerning the washing of the hands." When he has washed his face let him say : "Blessed... Who removest the bands of sleep from mine eyes and slumber from mine eyelids. May it be Thy will, O Lord my God, to accustom me to Thy Torah and cause me to cleave to Thy commandments, and lead me not into the power of sin, iniquity, temptation or contempt ; and subdue my will that it be subservient to Thee ; and keep me far from an evil man and evil companion ; and cause me to cleave to the good impulse and a good companion in Thy universe ; and let me obtain this day, and every day, grace, favour and mercy in Thine eyes and in the eyes of all who behold me; and bestow loving kindnesses upon me. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Who bestowest lovingkindnesses upon Thy people, Israel[1]." 

V. A man is in duty bound, etc. 

What means : A man is in duty bound to utter a benediction for the bad even as he utters one for the good? Are we to suppose that as for the good he says the benediction "...Who art good and dispensest good," he is to make the same benediction for the bad? For lo, our Mishnah teaches : For good tidings he says "Who art good and dispensest good" and For bad tidings he says "Blessed be the true Judge"! Raba said : It is only necessary that he should receive [the bad] with gladness. R. Aha[2] said in the name of R. Levi: What is the Scriptural authority? "I will sing of mercy and justice ; unto Thee, O Lord, will I sing praises" (Ps. ci. 1) — if it be mercy[3], I will sing ; and if it be justice[4], I will sing. R. Samuel b. Nahmani[5] said : It may be derived from the following: "In the Lord, I will praise His word ; in God, I will praise His word" (ibid. Ivi. 11)[6] — "In the Lord, I will praise His word" refers to His attribute of goodness; "In God, I will praise His word" refers to His attribute of retribution. R. Tanhum[7] said : It may be derived from the following : "I will lift up the cup of salvation and call upon the name of the Lord" (ibid. cxvi. 13) [and] "I found trouble and sorrow, but I called upon the name of the Lord" (ibid. vv. 3f). The Rabbis say : It may be derived from the following : "The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away ; blessed be the name of the Lord" (Job i. 21). 

Rab Huna stated that Rab said[1] in the name of R. Meir, (and it has been similarly taught in the name of R. 'Akiba) : A man should always accustom himself to say, "Whatever the All-merciful does, He does for the best[2]." As when R.'Akiba was journeying by the way, he came to a certain town and asked for hospitality, but it was refused him ; so he exclaimed, "Whatever the All - merciful does is for the best." He went and spent the night in the field, having with him a cock, an ass and a lamp[3]. A gust of wind came and extinguished the lamp, a cat came and ate the cock, and a lion came and devoured the ass ; but he exclaimed, "Whatever the All-merciful does is for the best." That same night a band of robbers came and captured the town[4]. He thereupon said to them[5], "Did I not tell you that whatever the Holy One, blessed be He, does is all for the best!"  

[[fol. 61 a.]]Rab Huna stated that Rab said[1] in the name of R. Meir : A man's words should always be few before the Holy One, blessed be He ; as it is said, "Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be hasty to utter a word before God ; for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth, therefore let thy words be few" (Eccles. v. 1). 

Rab Nahman b. Rab Hisda expounded : What means that which is written, "Then the Lord God formed man" (Gen. ii. 7), the word wayyiser "and He formed" being spelt with two letters yod? The Holy One, blessed be He, created two impulses[6], one good and the other evil. Rab Nahman b. Isaac objected : Therefore since the word wayyiser is not mentioned in connection with the animal[7] it has no evil impulse, and yet we see it injuring and biting and kicking ! Nay [the double yod is to be explained] according to the statement of R. Simeon b. Pazzi who said : Woe to me because of my Creator [yoseri][8], and woe to me because of my impulse [yisri][9]. Or [it may be explained] according to the statement of R. Jeremiah b. Eleazar who said : The Holy One, blessed be He, made Adam with two faces[1] ; as it is said, "Behind and before hast Thou formed me" (Ps. cxxxix. 5)[2]. 

"And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from the man, made He a woman" (Gen. ii. 22). Rab and Samuel [comment upon this] : One declared that it was a face [from which Eve was made] ; the other declared that it was a tail[3]. It is right according to him who says that it was a face; that is what is written, "Behind and before hast Thou formed me[4]." But according to him who said it was a tail, what means "Behind and before hast Thou formed me"? It is [to be explained] according to the statement of R. Ammi who said : "Behind[5]" refers to the work of creation, "before" to retribution[6]. It is right that "behind" may refer to the work of creation, for Adam was not created until the eve of the Sabbath ; but that "before" refers to retribution — retribution for what? Are we to suppose the punishment of the serpent-incident? Lo, there is a teaching : Rabbi says : With [the award of] greatness we begin with the most important ; but with a curse, we begin with the least important. With greatness we begin with the most important — for it is written, "And Moses spoke unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the meal-offering that remaineth" etc. (Lev, x. 12). With a curse we begin with the least important — first the serpent was cursed, then Eve and then Adam[7]! Nay, the retribution in connection with the flood [is referred to] ; for it is written, "And He blotted out every living substance which was upon the face of the ground, both man and cattle" (Gen. vii. 23)[8]. 

It is quite right according to him who says that [Eve was created from] a face ; that is what is written wayyiser "And He formed," spelt with a double yod. But according to him who said that it was from a tail, what means wayyiser? It is [to be explained] according to the statement of R. Simeon b. Pazzi who said : Woe to me because of my Creator and woe to me because of my impulse. It is quite right according to him who says that it was a face ; that is what is written, "Male and female created He them" (Gen. V. 2)[1]. But according to him who said it was a tail, what means "Male and female created He them"? It is [to be explained] according to R. Abbahu who asked : It is written "Male and female created He them," and it is written, "For in the image of God made He man" (ibid. ix. 6). How is this? At first He planned to create two, but in the end only one was created. It is quite right according to him who says it was a face ; that is what is written, "He closed up the place with flesh instead thereof " (ibid. ii. 21). But according to him who said it was a tail, what means "He closed up the place with flesh instead thereof"? R. Jeremiah (other versions : Rab Zebid ; Rab Nahman b. Isaac) said : That was only necessary in the place of the wound[2]. It is quite right according to him who said it was a tail ; that is what is written, "And He made [lit. built]" (ibid. v. 22)[3]. But according to him who said it was a face, what means "He made"? It is [to be explained] according to R. Simeon b. Menasya who expounded : What means, "And the rib which the Lord God had taken from the man, made He [banah] a woman"? It teaches that the Holy One, blessed be He, plaited her hair and brought her [adorned] to Adam ; for so in the sea-towns[4] they call plaits binyata[5]. 

Another explanation of "And He made [lit. built]" — Rab Hisda said (another version : It was taught in a Baraita) : This means that the Holy One, blessed be He, fashioned Eve like a store-building ; as the store is narrow above and broad below so as to receive the fruits, similarly is a woman narrow above and broad below so as to receive the child. "And He brought her unto the man" (ibid.). R. Jeremiah b. Eleazar said[6] : This means that the Holy One, blessed be He, constituted Himself Adam's "best man"; hence the Torah teaches a rule of conduct, viz. : that an eminent man should accompany one of less importance as "best man," and it will not injure [his dignity]. 

According to him who said [Eve was made from] a face, which of them[1] went in front? Rab Nahman b. Isaac said : It is more probable that the masculine countenance went in front ; for there is a teaching : A man should never walk behind a woman along the road, even his own wife[2]. Should a woman meet him on a bridge he should let her pass by on the side ; and whoever crosses a stream behind a woman will[3] have no portion in the world to come. 

Our Rabbis have taught: He who pays money to a woman counting it from his hand into hers for the sake of gazing at her, even if he possess Torah and good deeds like Moses our teacher, he will not escape the punishment of Gehinnom ; as it is said, "Hand to hand[4] the evil man shall not be unpunished" (Prov. xi. 21) — he shall not escape the punishment of Gehinnom. 

Rab Nahman said : Manoah was an 'Am ha'ares; for it is written, "And Manoah went after his wife" (Judges xiii. 11). Rab Nahman b. Isaac[5] retorted : But that is likewise true of[6] Elisha ; for it is written, "And he arose and followed her" (II Kings iv. 30) — here also he actually walked behind her ! Nay ; [it means that Elisha] followed her words and advice, and so also [in the instance of Manoah] he followed her words and advice. Rab Ashe said : With reference to what Rab Nahman said, viz. that Manoah was an 'Am ha'ares, he had not even learnt [the Scriptures which are taught] in an elementary school; as it is said, "And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man" (Gen. xxiv. 61) — they went behind the man, not in front of him. 

R. Johanan said[7] : A man should walk behind a lion rather than behind a woman, behind a woman rather than behind an idolater, behind an idolater rather than behind a Synagogue when the Congregation is at prayer[8]. But this last is only meant when he is not carrying a load ; should he, however, be carrying a load, there is no objection. It is only meant when there is no other entrance ; but should there be another entrance, there is no objection. It is further only meant when he is not riding upon an ass ; but should he be riding upon an ass, there is no objection. It is likewise only meant when he is not wearing Tefillin ; but if he is wearing Tefillin, there is no objection. 

Rab said : The evil impulse is like a fly and dwells between the  two entrances of the heart ; as it is said, "Dead flies make the ointment of the perfumers fetid and putrid" (Eccles. x. 1). Samuel said : It is like a kind of wheat [hittah] ; as it is said, "Sin [hatt'at] croucheth at the door" (Gen. iv. 7)[1]. 

Our Rabbis have taught : There are two reins in man, one prompting him to good, the other to evil. It is probable that the good is on the right side and the bad on the left ; for it is written, "A wise man's understanding is at his right hand; but a fool's understanding at his left" (Eccles. x. 2). 

Our Rabbis have taught : The reins prompt [the thought], the heart exercises intelligence, the tongue pronounces, the mouth completes [the words]. The gullet lets in and brings out all kinds of food[2], the windpipe produces voice, the lungs absorb all kinds [[fol. 61b.]] of liquids, the liver arouses anger, the gall lets a drop fall upon it and stills it, the milt produces laughter, the large intestine grinds [food], the maw induces sleep and the nose awakens. Should the organ which induces sleep arouse from sleep, or should the organ which arouses from sleep induce sleep, the person pines away. It has been taught : Should both of them induce sleep or arouse from sleep simultaneously, one immediately dies. 

There is a teaching : R. Jose of Galilee says[3] : The good impulse controls the righteous ; as it is said, "My heart is wounded within me" (Ps. cix. 22)[4]. The evil impulse controls the wicked ; as it is said, "Transgression speaketh to the wicked, in the midst of the heart, There is no fear of God before his eyes" (ibid, xxxvi. 2). Both impulses control average people ; as it is said, "Because He standeth at the right hand of the needy, to save him from them that judge his soul" (Ps. cix. 31)[1]. Raba said, "The average people are, for instance, ourselves." Abbai said to him, "The master does not leave life for any creature[2]!" Raba also said : The universe was only created for the completely wicked or the completely righteous[3]. Raba said : Let a man know himself whether he is completely righteous or not. Rab said[4] : The universe was only created for Ahab the son of Omri and for R. Hannina b. Dosa — for Ahab the son of Omri, this world[5]; and for R. Hannina b. Dosa, the world to come[6]. 

"And thou shalt love the Lord thy God" (Deut. vi. 5). 

There is a teaching : R. Eliezer says : If it is stated "With all thy soul," why is it stated "With all thy might"? And if it is stated "With all thy might," why is it stated "With all thy soul"? But should there be a man whose body is dearer to him than his money[7], therefore it is stated "With all thy soul[8]"; and should there be a man whose money is dearer to him than his body, therefore it is stated "With all thy might." R. 'Akiba says: "With all thy soul" [means,] even if He take thy soul[9]. 

Our Rabbis have taught : Once the wicked[10] government decreed that Israel should no longer occupy themselves with Torah. There came Pappos b. Judah and found R. 'Akiba attracting great assemblies and studying Torah. He said to him, "'Akiba, art thou not afraid of the wicked government?" He replied, "I will tell thee a parable : To what is the matter like ? To a fox who was walking along the bank of the stream and saw some fishes gathering together from one place to another. He said to them, 'From what are you fleeing?' They answered, 'From nets which men are bringing against us.' He said to them, 'Let it be your pleasure to come up on the dry land, and let us, me and you, dwell together even as my fathers dwelt with your fathers.' They replied, 'Art thou he of whom they tell that thou art the shrewdest of animals? Thou art not clever but a fool ! For if we are afraid in the place which is our life-element, how much more so in a place which is our death-element!' So also is it with us ; Now while we sit and study Torah, in which it is written, 'For that is thy life, and the length of thy days' (Deut. xxx. 20), we are in such a plight, how much more so if we go and neglect it!" 

It is related that but a few days passed when they arrested R. 'Akiba and bound him in prison, and they arrested Pappos b. Judah and bound him by his side. 'Akiba said to him, "Pappos, who brought thee here?" He replied, "Happy art thou, R. 'Akiba, inasmuch as thou hast been arrested on account of the Torah! But woe to me, Pappos, who has been arrested on trivial grounds!" 

When they brought R. 'Akiba out to execution, it was the time for reading the Shema' ; and though they were combing his flesh with iron combs, he kept receiving upon himself the yoke of the Kingdom of Heaven[1]. His disciples said to him, "Our master, thus far[2]!" He answered them, "Throughout my life I have been troubled about this verse, '[And thou shalt love the Lord thy God...] and with all thy soul' which means : Even if He take thy life. For said I, 'When will it be in my power to fulfil it?' But now that the opportunity is mine, shall I not fulfil if?" He prolonged the word ehad[3] until his soul left [the body] with the word ehad [on his lips]. A Bat Kol issued forth and announced, "Happy art thou, R. 'Akiba, that thy soul went out with the word ehad!" The ministering angels spake before the Holy One, blessed be He, "Such Torah, and such a reward? 'From men, by Thy hand, O Lord, from men' etc. (Ps. xvii. 14)[4]." He replied to them, "Their portion is in this life" (ibid.). A Bat Kol issued forth and announced, "Happy art thou, R. 'Akiba, for thou art destined for the life of the world to come!" 

A man should not behave with levity towards the East Gate [of the Temple], since it is directed towards the Holy of Holies, etc. 

Rab Judah said in the name of Rab[5] : This is only meant from Sophim[6] inwards, and only applies to one who can see [the Temple]. It has been similarly reported : R. Abba b. R. Hijya. b. Abba said : Thus declared R. Johanan[1] : This is only meant from Sophim inwards, and only applies to one who can see [the Temple] and when there is no barrier [between him and it], and at the time when the Shekinah rests [upon the Sanctuary][2]. 

Our Rabbis have taught : He who wishes to exercise his natural functions, if in Judea he should not face East or West[3] but North or South ; if in Galilee, he should only face East or West. R. Jose, however, permits it [in any direction] because he used to say that the prohibition only applies to one who can see [the Temple], when there is no barrier, and at the time when the Shekinah rests [upon the Sanctuary]. But the Sages prohibit it. Then the Sages agree with the first Tanna[4]! The question of the side divides them[5]. 

There is another teaching : He who wishes to exercise his natural functions, if in Judea he must not face East or West, but North or South ; but in Galilee, North and South are prohibited, East or West is permitted. R. Jose, however, permits it [in any direction], because he used to say that the prohibition only applies to one who can see [the Temple]. R. Judah says : It is prohibited while the Temple is standing ; but when the Temple is no longer standing it is permitted. R. 'Akiba prohibits it in all circumstances. Then R. 'Akiba agrees with the first Tanna! The question of outside the [Holy] Land is between them[6]. 

Rabbah[7] had bricks set up for him facing East and West[8]. Abbai went and put them facing North and South[9] ; but Rabbah[7] proceeded to put them right, exclaiming, "Who is it that is troubling me ? I agree with R. 'Akiba's view when he declared that it is prohibited in all circumstances." 

[[fol. 62 a.]] There is a teaching : R. 'Akiba said : Once I went into a privy behind R. Joshua and learnt from him three things. I learnt that we should not evacuate East or West, but North or South. I learnt that we should not expose ourselves standing but sitting. I also learnt that we should not wipe ourselves with the right hand but with the left[1]. Ben 'Azzai said to him, "Wert thou so impudent with thy master?" He replied, "It was a matter of Torah and I wished to learn." 

There is a teaching : Ben 'Azzai said : I once went into a privy behind R. 'Akiba and learnt from him three things. I learnt that we should not evacuate East or West, but North or South. I learnt that we should not expose ourselves standing but sitting. I also learnt that we should not wipe ourselves with the right hand but with the left. R. Judah said to him, "Wert thou so impudent with thy master?" He replied, "It was a matter of Torah and I wished to learn." 

Rab Kahana went and hid himself under Rab's bed and heard him converse [with his wife] and laugh and have intercourse. Rab Kahana said to him, "Abba's[2] mouth is like that of one who has never sipped a dish[3]." Rab exclaimed, "Kahana, art thou here? Go out ; for it is not proper!" He replied, "It is a matter of Torah and I wished to learn[4]." 

Why should we not wipe with the right hand but only with the left? Raba said : Because the Torah was given with the right hand ; as it is said, "At His right hand was a fiery law unto them" (Deut. xxxiii. 2). Rabbah b. Bar Hannah said[5] : Because it is near the mouths[6]. R. Simeon b. Lakish said : Because he binds the Tefillin with it. Rab Nahman b. Isaac said: Because he points to the accents of the Torah with it[7]. It is like [the discussion of] the Tannaim. R. Eliezer says : Because he eats with it. R. Joshua says : Because he writes with it. R. 'Akiba said : Because he points to the accents of the Torah with it. 

R. Tanhum b. Hanilai said : Whoever is modest in a privy is delivered from three things : from serpents, scorpions and evil spirits[8] ; some say : Also his dreams will be such that his mind will be set at ease. There was a privy in Tiberias[1] which if two people entered, even by day, they came to harm. R. Ammi and R. Assi entered it separately and no harm befell them. The Rabbis said to them, "Were you not afraid?" They answered, "We were taught a charm[2]: a charm for the privy is modesty and silence ; a charm against sufferings is silence and prayer," Abbai reared a lamb to accompany him into the privy[3]. But he should have roared a goat[4]! A satyr may be changed into a goat. Before Raba was appointed Principal [of the Seminary], the daughter of Rab Hisda[5] used to rattle a nut in a flask for him[6]; but afterwards when he ruled [over the Seminary] she made an aperture for him [in the wall] and placed her hand upon his head[7].
 
'Ulla said : Behind a fence one may ease himself immediately[8]; but in an open place[9] [he may do it] so long as he can break wind without anybody hearing it. Issi b. Nathan[10] taught as follows : Behind a fence [he may ease himself] so long as he can break wind without anybody hearing, but in an open place so long as nobody sees him. Against this [latter teaching] is quoted : They[11] may go out from the entrance of the olive-press and ease themselves behind a fence[8], and they remain in a state of ritual purity ! They take a more lenient view in connection with [those who supervise] ritual purity[12]. Come and hear: [It has been taught:] To what distance may they[11] go and remain clean? So long as one can see them[13]! It is different with food-stuffs whose purity [must be supervised], because the Rabbis take a more lenient view in such a case. Rab Ashe asked : What means "so long as nobody sees him," as stated by Issi b. Nathan? So long as his neighbour cannot see the exposed part of the body, but he may see the man himself. 

A certain funeral-orator who went down [to deliver an address] in the presence of Rab Nahman said, "How modest was [the deceased] in his habits!" Rab Nahman said to him, "Didst thou ever go into a privy with him that thou knowest whether he was modest or not? For there is a teaching : He only is called modest who is so in a privy." But what had Rab Nahman to care about in this matter? Because there is a teaching : As the dead are called to account [for their deeds], so are the funeral-orators[1] and they who respond ["Amen"] after them called to account. 

Our Rabbis have taught : Who is modest ? He who relieves himself at night in the same place where he relieves himself by day[2]. But it is not so ! For lo, Rab Judah said in the name of Rab : A man should always accustom himself [to perform his natural functions] morning and evening[3] so that it will be unnecessary for him to go far [and find a secluded spot]. And further, Raba used to go as far as a Mil by day ; but at night he would say to his attendant, "Prepare for me a place in the street of the town." Similarly used R. Zera to say to his attendant, "See whether there is anybody behind the Seminary, as I wish to relieve myself"! Read not [in the Baraita] "in the same place," but read "in the same manner that he relieves himself by day[4]." Rab Ashe said : Even if thou retainest the words "the same place" [there is no contradiction, because it means,] it is only necessary [to proceed] to a corner[5]. 

It was stated above : "Rab Judah said in the name of Rab : A man should always accustom himself [to perform his natural functions] morning and evening, so that it will be unnecessary for him to go far [and find a secluded spot]." There is a teaching to the same effect : Ben 'Azzai says : Rise early and go out, and act likewise after dusk so that thou needest not go a distance ; feel the need and then sit down, but do not sit down and then [wait to] feel the need, for whoever does so, even should they practise sorcery in Aspamia[6] it will befall him. But should he through forgetfulness act thus, what is his remedy ? On rising, let him say as follows, "Not to me, not to me[1] ; no Tahim and no Tahtim[2] ; not these and not from these[3] ; no charms of a sorcerer and no charms of a sorceress." 

[[fol. 62 b.]] There is a teaching : Ben 'Azzai says : Lie upon any couch but not on the floor ; sit upon any seat except a beam[4]. Samuel said : Sleeping at dawn is like a steel edge to iron[5] ; evacuation at dawn is like a steel edge to iron. Bar Kappara used to sell proverbs for denarii : "While thou art hungry, eat ; while thou art thirsty, drink ; while the cauldron is still hot, pour out[6]." "When the horn is sounded in [the market of] Rome[7], O son of a fig-seller, sell thy father's figs[8]." Abbai said to the Rabbis : When you pass through the alleys of a town to go into the country, look neither to the one side nor the other, lest women be sitting there, and it is not proper to gaze at them. 

Rab Safra entered a privy. R. Abba came and emitted a sound at the door[9]. Rab Safra said to him, "Let the master enter." After leaving, R. Abba said to him, "So far thou hast not brought in the demon ; but thou hast received the tradition about the demon[10]. Have we not learnt thus in the Mishnah : There was an open fire-place there [in the Temple-court], and a splendid privy ; and this was its splendid feature : if it was found locked, it was known that somebody was in there, but if it was found open, it was known that it was vacant[11]. Hence infer that it is not proper [to speak in a privy]! But Rab Safra thought that it was dangerous[12]; for there is a teaching[13] : Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel says : If the fecal discharge is kept back it causes dropsy, and if the fluid in the urinary duct is kept back it causes jaundice. R. Eleazar[1] entered a privy ; a certain Roman[2] came and pushed him. R. Eleazar got up and went out ; and a serpent came and tore out the [Roman's] gut. R. Eleazar applied to him the verse : "Therefore will I give a man under thee" (Is. xliii. 4) — read not adam "a man" but Edom "an Edomite[3]." 

"And he said to kill thee, but it spared thee" (I Sam. xxiv. 11)[4]. "And he said"! It ought to be "And I said"; "but it spared"! It ought to be "but I spared." R. Eleazar said : Thus spake David to Saul, "According to the Torah, thou art liable to be put to death, because thou art a pursuer ; and the Torah declares that if one comes to kill thee, kill him first[5]. But the modesty which is manifest in thee has spared thee." In what did [Saul's modesty] consist? For it is written, "And he came to the sheep-cotes[6] by the way, where was a cave ; and Saul went in to cover his feet" (ibid. V. 4). It has been taught that it was a fence within a fence and a cave within a cave. "To cover" — R. Eleazar said: This teaches that he covered himself like a booth[7]. 

"Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privily" (ibid. V. 5). R. Jose b. R. Hannina[8] said : Whoever deals contemptuously with garments will in the end derive no benefit from them ; as it is said, "Now King David was old and stricken in years ; and they covered him with clothes but he could get no heat" (I Kings i. 1). 

"If it be the Lord that hath stirred thee up against me, let Him accept an offering" (I Sam. xxvi. 19). R. Eleazar said[9]: Thus spake the Holy One, blessed be He, to David, Thou callest Me a "stirrer-up," behold I will cause thee to stumble in a matter which even school-children know ; for it is written, "When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel, according to their number, then shall they give every man a ranson for his soul unto the Lord... that there be no plague among them, when thou numberest them" (Exod. xxx. 12). Immediately "Satan stood up against Israel" (I Chron. xxi. 1); for it is written, "He stirred up David against them, saying, Go, number Israel and Judah" (II Sam. xxiv. 1). But when he numbered them, he took no ransom from them ; and it is written, "So the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed" (ibid. v. 15). What means "the time appointed" ? Samuel[1] the Elder, the son-in-law of R. Hannina, said in the name of R. Hannina : From the time of slaying the continual offering until the time of the sprinkling of the blood. R. Johanan said : [It means] precisely until noon.
 
"And He said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough [rab]" (ibid. v. 16). R. Eleazar said: Thus spake the Holy One, blessed be He, to the angel, Take for me the chief [rab] among them, so that through him I can punish them for their sins[2]. At that moment Abishai b. Zeruiah died, who was equal [in worth] to the majority of the Sanhedrin. 

"And as he was about to destroy, the Lord beheld, and He repented Him" (I Chron. xxi. 15). What did He behold? Rab said : He beheld our father Jacob ; for it is written, "And Jacob said when he beheld them" (Gen. xxxii. 3). Samuel said : He beheld the ashes of [the sacrifice substituted for] Isaac ; as it is said, "God will provide[3] Himself the lamb" (ibid. xxii. 8). R. Isaac the Smith[4] said : He beheld the money of the atonement; as it is said, "And thou shalt take the atonement money from the children of Israel" etc. (Exod. xxx. 16). R. Johanan said: He beheld the Temple ; for it is written, "In the mount where the Lord is seen" (Gen. xxii. 14). R. Jacob b. Iddi and R. Samuel b. Nahmani[5] differ in this matter; one declaring that He beheld the atonement money, the other declaring that He beheld the Temple. The more probable view is that of him who said that He beheld the Sanctuary ; because it is said, "As it is said to this day, In the mount where the Lord is seen." 

Nor may one enter the Temple Mount with his staff"...; nor may he use it as a short cut [koppendaria].
 
What means koppendaria? Raba said : A short cut, as the word implies[6]. But Rab Hanna[7] b. Adda said in the name of Rab Samma b. R. Mari: It is as people say, "Instead of going round the row of houses[1], I will go through it" Rab Nahman said in the name of Rabbah b. Abbuha: If one enters a Synagogue not for the purpose of making it a short cut, he may use it in that manner. R. Abbahu said : If it was originally a public path[2], it is permitted [as a short cut for all]. R. Helbo said in the name of Rab Huna: Who enters a Synagogue to pray is allowed to use it as a short cut ; as it is said, "But when the people of the land shall come before the Lord in the appointed seasons, he that entereth by the way of the north gate to worship shall go forth by the way of the south gate" (Ezek. xlvi. 9). 

And to expectorate on the Temple Mount is forbidden a fortiori. 

Rab Bebai said in the name of R. Joshua b. Levi[3] : Whoever expectorates on the Temple Mount in this time[4] is as though he expectorates into the pupil of his eye[5]; as it is said, "And Mine eyes and My heart shall be there perpetually" (I Kings ix. 3). Raba said : Expectoration is allowed in a Synagogue, because it is analogous to [the wearing of] a shoe — just as [the wearing of] a shoe is prohibited on the Temple Mount but is permitted in a Synagogue, so is expectoration forbidden on the Temple Mount but permitted in a Synagogue. Rab Pappa said to Raba (other versions : Rabina to Raba ; Rab Adda b. Mattena to Raba) : Why should one derive it [by analogy] from a shoe ; let him derive it from the short cut ! He replied : The Tanna derives it from the shoe, and thou sayest [it should be derived] from the short cut — how can that be? For there is a teaching : A man must not enter the Temple Mount with his staff in his hand, his shoe upon his foot, and his money tied up in his cloth or in his money-bag thrown over his shoulder, nor may he make it a short cut ; and [the prohibition of] expectoration is derived a fortiori from the shoe — as in the case of a shoe which is not in itself contemptible the Torah declares, "Put off thy shoes from off thy feet" (Exod. iii. 5), must not expectoration, which is in itself contemptible, be all the more forbidden ! R. Jose b. Judah[6] says : [This reasoning] is unnecessary ; for it is stated, "For none might enter within the king's gate clothed with sackcloth" (Esther iv. 2) — and is there not here an a fortiori deduction : If it is thus with sackcloth which is not a disgusting thing in the presence of human beings, must not expectoration, which is disgusting in the presence of the supreme King of kings, be all the more prohibited ! [Rab Pappa] answered : This is the position I take up : Let us derive a strict conclusion[1] from the instance, [of the shoe] and also from the instance [of the short cut] [[fol. 63a.]]; and I say that with reference to the Temple Mount where [the wearing of] a shoe is forbidden, let one derive [the prohibition against expectoration] from a shoe; but with reference to the Synagogue[2] where one is permitted [to wear] shoes, instead of deriving permission [to expectorate, by analogy] from a shoe, let him derive a prohibition [against expectoration, by analogy] from the short cut ! But, answered Raba : [The Synagogue] is analogous to his own house — as a man is concerned about anybody using his house as a short cut but is not concerned about expectoration or [the wearing of] shoes, so also with the Synagogue, as a short cut it is prohibited, but expectoration and [the wearing of] shoes are allowed. 

At the conclusion of every benediction in the Sanctuary they used to say "For ever," etc. 

"Why all this[3]? Because the response "Amen" was never made in the Sanctuary. Whence is it that "Amen" was never used as a response in the Sanctuary? As it is said, "Stand up and bless the Lord your God from everlasting to everlasting" (Nehem. ix. 5), and it continues, "And let them say: Blessed be Thy glorious Name, that is exalted above all blessing and praise" (ibid)[4]. It is possible to think that all benedictions should have one praise[5]; therefore there is a teaching to state, "Above all[6] blessing and praise" — for each benediction give Him praise. 

It was further ordained that a man should greet his friends by mentioning the Divine Name, etc. 

What means "And it is said[7]"? Shouldest thou argue that Boaz mentioned [the Divine Name in his salutation] of his own accord[8], come and hear: "The Lord is with thee, thou mighty man of valour" (Judges vi. 12). Shouldest thou argue that it was an angel that spake to Gideon[1], come and hear : "Despise not thy mother[2] when she is old" (Prov. xxiii. 22). And it is stated, "It is time for the Lord to work ; they have made void Thy Law" (Ps. cxix. 126). Raba said : This verse is to be explained from the first clause to the second, and from the second to the first. It is to be explained from the first clause to the second, thus : "It is time for the Lord to work" ; why? Because "they have made void Thy Law." It is to be explained from the second to the first, thus: "They have made void Thy Law"; why? Because "It is time for the Lord to work." 

There is a teaching : Hillel the Elder says : When people collect [learning], do thou scatter ; when they scatter [learning], do thou collect[3]. If thou seest a generation to which Torah is dear, do thou scatter ; as it is said, "There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth" (Prov. xi. 24); but if thou seest a generation to which Torah is not dear, do thou collect ; as it is said, "It is time for the Lord to work ; they have made void Thy Law." 

Bar Kappara expounded[4] : "If goods are cheap, hasten[5] and buy them." "In a place where there is no man, be a man[6]." Abbai said ; Infer from this that where there is a man, do not be a man[7]. This is evident ! No, it is necessary for the case where the two of them are of equal standing[8]. Bar Kappara expounded : Which is a brief Scriptural passage upon which all the principles of the Torah depend? "In all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He will direct thy paths" (ibid. iii. 6). Raba said : Even for a matter of transgression[1]. Bar Kappara expounded : A man should always teach his son a clean and light trade[2]. Which is such? Rab Hisda[3] said : Needle-stitching[4]. 

There is a teaching: Rabbi[5] says : A man should never multiply friends[6] in his house; as it is said, "There are friends that one hath to his own hurt" (Prov. xviii. 24). There is a teaching : Rabbi says : Let not a man appoint a steward over his house ; for if Potiphar had not appointed Joseph steward over his house, he would not have experienced the incident [of his wife's temptation]. There is a teaching : Rabbi says : Why does the section of the Nazirite adjoin the section of the woman suspected of adultery[7]? To tell thee that whoever sees such a woman in her disgrace should separate himself from wine[8]. 

Hezekiah b. R. Parnak said in the name of R. Parnak[9] in the name of R. Johanan : Why does the section of the woman suspected of adultery adjoin the section of the offerings and tithes ? To tell thee that whoever has offerings and tithes and does not hand them to the priest will in the end require the services of a priest in the matter of his wife; as it is said, "And every man's hallowed things shall be his[10]" (Num. v. 10) and next to it is, "If any man's wife go aside" (ibid. v. 12). Not only that, but in the end he will be in need of the offerings and tithes[11] ; as it is said, "And every man's hallowed things shall be his[12]." Rab Nahman b. Isaac[13] said : Should he duly hand them over, in the end he will grow rich ; as it is said, "Whatever any man giveth the priest, it shall be his" (Num. v. 10) — i.e. much wealth shall be his. 

Rab Huna b. Berekiah said in the name of R. Eleazar ha-Kappar : Whoever associates the name of Heaven with his trouble[1], his substance will be doubled for him ; as it is said, "And the Almighty be thy treasure, and precious[2] silver unto thee" (Job xxii. 25). R. Samuel b. Nahmani said : His sustenance will fly to him like a bird ; as it is said, "And precious silver unto thee." 

[3]R. Tabi said in the name of Josiah : Whoever relaxes from words of Torah will have no strength to stand in the day of trouble; as it is said, "If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small indeed" (Prov. xxiv. 10). R. Ammi[4] b. Mattenah said in the name of Samuel : Even [if he relax from] a single commandment ; as it is said, "If thou faint" — i.e. in any single instance. 

Rab Safra said : R. Abbahu related that when Hananyah[5], the nephew of R. Joshua, went to the Diaspora[6], he used to intercalate the years[7] and fix the new moons outside the [Holy] Land. They sent two disciples of the wise to him, R. Jose b. Kippar, and the grandson of Zechariah b. Kabutal. When he saw them, he asked, "Why have you come?" They answered, "To study Torah have we come." He issued a proclamation[8]. "These men are the famous men of the generation and their fathers ministered in the Temple ; as we have learnt : Zechariah b. Kabutal says, 'Often have I read from the Book of Daniel before [the High Priest][9]'." Hananyah began to declare certain things unclean, and they pronounced them clean ; he forbade certain things, and they declared them permissible. He thereupon proclaimed concerning them, "These men are worthless and men of no standing [and their fathers defiled the High Priesthood][10]." They said to him, "Thou hast already built up [our reputation here] and thou canst not pull down ; thou hast already raised a fence and thou canst not make a breach." He said to them, "Why, when I declare something unclean, do you pronounce it clean, and when I forbid you permit?" They said to him, "Why dost thou intercalate years and fix new moons outside the [Holy] Land?" He replied, "Did not 'Akiba b. Joseph act similarly[1]?" They said to him, "Keep R. 'Akiba out of it, because he left not his equal in the land of Israel[2]." He said to them, "I also have not left my equal in the land of Israel." They said to him, "The kids which thou didst leave behind have grown into goats with horns; and they have sent us to thee, saying to us, 'Go, tell him in our name[3]; if he obeys, well and good ; but if not, let him be excommunicated. 

[[fol. 63b.]] Tell also our brethren in the Diaspora[4]; if they obey, well and good ; but if not, let them ascend a mountain[5], let Ahiyyah[6] build an altar and Hananyah play the harp[7], and let them all repudiate [their Judaism], declaring that they have no lot with the God of Israel'." Immediately all the people broke forth into loud weeping and said, "God forbid! We have a lot with the God of Israel." Why all this? Because it is said, "For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem" (Is. ii. 3). 

It is quite right that Hananyah declared something unclean and they pronounced it clean ; that is merely taking the stricter view. But how could he declare anything unclean and they pronounce it clean? For lo, there is a teaching: If a Sage declares anything unclean, his colleague is not allowed to pronounce it clean ; and if he declares it forbidden, his colleague is not allowed to pronounce it permissible! They thought [to act thus] so that the people may not be led by him. 

Our Rabbis have taught : When our Rabbis entered the vineyard of Jabneh[8], there were present R. Judah, R. Jose, R. Nehemiah and R. Eliezer[1], the son of R. Jose of Galilee. They all began to expound Torah in honour of the hospitality [which had been extended to them]. R. Judah, the chief of orators[2] in every place, began with the honour of the Torah and expounded : "Now Moses used to take the tent and pitch it without the camp" (Exod. xxxiii. 7). Can we not use here an a fortiori argument : If of the Ark of God, which was never more than twelve Mil[3] distant, the Torah declares, "Everyone that sought the Lord went out unto the tent of meeting, which was without the camp" (ibid.), how much more so[4], the disciples of the wise who go from city to city and from province to province to study Torah! 

[5]"And the Lord spoke unto Moses face to face" (ibid. v. 11). R. Isaac said : The Holy One, blessed be He, spake unto Moses, "Moses, I and thou will discuss aspects[6] of Halakah." Another version : Thus spake the Holy One, blessed be He, unto Moses, "In the same manner that I have shown thee a cheerful countenance, do thou likewise show Israel a cheerful countenance, and restore the tent to its place." "And he would return into the camp" etc. (ibid.). R. Abbahu said : The Holy One, blessed be He, spake to Moses, "Now will they say, The Master is angry[7] and the disciple is angry[8]; what will become of Israel? If thou wilt restore the tent to its place [within the camp], well and good ; but if not, Joshua the son of Nun, thy disciple, will minister in thy stead." That is what is written, "And he would return into the camp[9]." Raba said : Nevertheless the word did not go forth from Him in vain ; as it is said, "But his minister Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tent" (ibid.). 

Further did R. Judah begin with the honour of the Torah and expound : "Attend and hear; this day thou art become a people unto the Lord thy God" (Deut. xxvii. 9). But was it on that day that the Torah had been given to Israel[10]? Was that not the completion of forty years! But it is intended to teach thee that every day is the Torah endeared to them who study it as on the day that it was given on Mount Sinai. R. Tanhum b. R. Hiyya, of the town of Acco, said : Thou mayest know from this that should a man recite the Shema' morning and evening, but omit it a single evening, he is like one who has never recited it at all. 

"Attend [hasket]" — i.e. "form classes[1]" and occupy yourselves with Torah, because Torah is only acquired in a class. This is in accord with the statement of R. Jose b. R. Hannina who said : What means that which is written, "A sword is upon the boasters [baddim] and they shall become fools" (Jer. 1. 36)? A sword is upon the enemies of the disciples of the wise[2] who sit separately [bad wa-bad] and study Torah. Not only so, but they become foolish ; for it is written here "And they shall become fools" and in another passage it is written, "For that we have done foolishly" (Num. xii. 11)[3]. If thou wilt I can quote the following: "The princes of Zoan are become fools" (Is. xix. 13). 

Another explanation of "Attend [hasket] and hear, O Israel" (Deut. xxvii. 9) — i.e. submit to blows [kattetu] on behalf of the words of Torah ; according to the statement of R. Simeon b. Lakish who said : Whence is it learnt that the words of Torah endure only with him who would suffer death on its behalf? As it is said, "This is the law : when a man dieth in a tent" (Num. xix. 14)[4]. Another explanation of "Attend [hasket] and hear, O Israel": Be silent [has] and then discuss [kattet]; according to the statement of Raba who said : A man should always study Torah first and afterwards meditate thereon. 

The school of R. Jannai said : What means that which is written, "For the churning of milk bringeth forth curd, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood ; so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife" (Prov. xxx. 33)? With whom dost thou find the cream of Torah? With him who spat out for its sake the milk which he sucked from his mother's breast[5]. "And the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood" — a disciple with whom his master is the first time angry[6] but he remains silent [under the rebuke] is worthy to distinguish between impure and pure blood[7]. "So the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife" — a disciple with whom his master is the first and second time angry but he remains silent [under the rebuke] is worthy to distinguish between suits involving money and suits involving life. For there is a Mishnaic teaching: R. Ishmael says : Who wishes to grow wise should study money-suits, for there is no branch of Torah more [complex] than these ; they are like a well[1]. 

R. Samuel b. Nahmani said : What means that which is written, "If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast planned devices [zamam], lay thy hand upon thy mouth" (Prov. xxx. 32)? Everyone who makes himself foolish[2] for the sake of words of Torah will in the end be lifted up ; but if he muzzles [zamam] his mouth[3], he will have to put his hand to his mouth[4]. 

R. Nehemiah began [to speak] in honour of the hospitality and expounded : What means that which is written, "And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them ; for ye showed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt" (I Sam. XV. 6)? Can we not use here an a fortiori argument : If Jethro[5], who only befriended Moses for his own honour, is treated with so much consideration, how much more so one who entertains a disciple of the wise in his house, giving him to eat and drink, and allowing him to enjoy his possessions! 

R. Jose began [to speak] in honour of the hospitality and expounded : "Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite, for he is thy brother; thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian, because thou wast a stranger in his land" (Deut. xxiii. 8). Can we not use here an a fortiori argument? If the Egyptians are not to be abhorred, who only befriended the Israelites for their own needs — as it is said, "And if thou knowest any able men among them, then make them rulers over my cattle" (Gen. xlvii. 6) — how much more so, one who entertains a disciple of the wise in his house, giving him to eat and drink, and allowing him to enjoy his possessions! 

R. Eliezer, the son of R. Jose of Galilee, began [to speak] in honour of the hospitality and expounded : "And the Lord blessed Obed-Edom and all his house...because of the Ark of God" (II Sam. vi. llf.). Can we not use here an a fortiori argument? If the Ark which neither ate nor drank, but which Obed-Edom swept and besprinkled[1], brought him a blessing, how much more so one who entertains a disciple of the wise, giving him to eat and drink, and allowing him to enjoy his possessions ! What was the blessing wherewith He blessed him ? R. Judah b. Zebida said : It refers to Hamot[2] and her eight daughters-in-law who each bore six children [[fol. 64a.]] at one birth ; as it is said, "Peullethai the eighth son" (I Chron. xxvi. 5), and it is written "For God blessed him" (ibid.), "All these were the sons of Obed-Edom, they and their sons and their brethren, able men in strength for the service ; threescore and two of Obed-Edom" (ibid. v. 8)[3].
 
R. Abin the Levite[4] said : Whoever forces fate[5], fate will force him; but whoever yields to fate, fate yields to him. So was it with Rabbah and Rab Joseph ; for Rab Joseph [was nicknamed] "Sinai[6]" and Rabbah "the uprooter of mountains[7]." The time needed them[8]; so [the electors] sent [a message] there[9], "Of 'Sinai' and 'the uprooter of mountains,' which should be given preference?" They returned answer, "'Sinai' should be preferred, because all stand in need of an owner of wheat[10]." Nevertheless Rab Joseph did not accept the offer, because the Chaldeans[11] told him, "Thou wilt reign only two years[12]." Rabbah ruled two and twenty years[13], and then Rab Joseph two and a half; but all the years that Rabbah ruled he never called a cupper to his house[14]. 

R. Abin the Levite also said : What means that which is written, "The Lord answer thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob set thee up on high" (Ps. xx. 2)? The God of Jacob, but not the God of Abraham and Isaac ! From this we learn that the owner of a beam should go in with the heaviest part of it[1]. 

R. Abin the Levite also said : Whoever partakes of a meal at which a disciple of the wise is present is as though he partakes of the lustre of the Shekinah; as it is said, "And Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law before God" (Exod. xviii. 12). Did they eat before God? Was it not before Moses that they ate? But it means to tell thee that whoever partakes of a meal at which a disciple of the wise is present is as though he partakes of the lustre of the Shekinah. 

R. Abin the Levite also said : One who takes leave of his friend should not say to him, "Go in peace" but "Go to peace"; because in the case of Jethro who said to Moses "Go to peace" (Exod. iv. 18), the latter advanced and prospered ; but in the case of David who said to Absalom "Go in peace" (II Sam. xv. 9), the latter went and was hanged. 

R. Abin the Levite also said : One who takes leave of the dead should not say to him, "Go to peace" but "Go in peace" ; as it is said, "But thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace" (Gen. xv. 15). 

R. Levi b. Hiyya said[2]: He who goes out from the Synagogue and enters the House of Study to occupy himself with Torah is worthy to receive the presence of the Shekinah; as it is said, "They go from strength to strength, every one of them appeareth before God in Zion" (Ph. Ixxxiv. 8). 

R. Hiyya b. Ashe said in the name of Rab[3] : The disciples of the wise have rest neither in this world nor in the world to come; as it is said, "They go from strength to strength, every one of them appeareth before God in Zion." 

R. Eleazar said in the name of R. Hannina: The disciples of the wise increase peace in the world; as it is said, "And all thy children shall be taught of the Lord ; and great shall be the peace of thy children" (Is. liv. 13). Read not banayik "thy children" but bonayik "thy builders[1]" "Great peace have they that love Thy law; and there is no stumbling for them" (Ps. cxix. 165). "Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces" (ibid, cxxii. 7). "For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee" (ibid. v. 8). "For the sake of the house of the Lord our God, I will seek thy good" (ibid. v. 9). "The Lord will give strength unto His people ; the Lord will bless His people with peace" (ibid. xxix. 11)[2]
