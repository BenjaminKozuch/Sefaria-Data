1 Produce from which it is uncertain whether the tithe has been given. For the law of the tithe, see Lev. xxvii. 30 ff. 

2 Due to the Levites; cf. Num. xviii. 21. 

3 The Levite had to give a tenth of his tithe to the priest, known as the Terumah of the tithe ; cf. Num. xviii. 26. 

4 Cf. Deut. xiv. 22 ff. This was a tithe of the produce after the Levite had received his tithe, and had to be eaten in Jerusalem or redeemed by its equivalent in money being spent there. 

5 The original reading was probably "heathen" and altered to "idolator" to satisfy the Censor. 

6 That three who eat together should say Grace with Zimmun. 

7 The unspecified plural "ye" denotes two and "me" the third. 

8 "I" is one and "ye" two, making a total of three.

1 M.: Raba. 

2 I.e. with a voice equal to mine. 

3 In the ancient Synagogues, the Scriptural lesson read in Hebrew was followed by a translation in the Aramaic vernacular; cf. Oesterley and Box, pp. 46 ff. 

4 This contradicts the opinion that two may, if they wish it. 

5 But if two may arrange Zimmun, why may not one leave ? 

6 Whereas if they separate, it would be only voluntary with two. 

7 The minimum quantity of food which necessitates the saying of Grace. 

8 In order to make a third for Zimmun. 

9 By the attendant joining with them, even uninvited.

1 Edd. read here "And lo, even a hundred women," which should probably be omitted. See D. S. ad loc. 

2 In that there is no obligation for Zimmun, but it is purely voluntary. 

3 This speaks as though it were obligatory for women ; and if a hundred women are equal to two men in this respect, then it should be obligatory for two men ! 

4 There are at least three women so that the number required by Pb. xxziv. 4 is forthcoming, which is not the case with two men. 

5 I.e. two. 

6 And accordingly Rab teaches that two men may not arrange Zimmun. 

7 By being three originally, the obligation remains ; but if there were only two, they could voluntarily arrange Zimmun. Hence Rab cannot be the author of the statement in question. 

8 M.: Rabbah said to Rab Huna.

1 Who was a Palestinian teacher, whereas Rab was a Babylonian. 

2 I.e. he is within hearing distance. 

3 When ten or more dine together, "our God" is added in the introduction to the Grace ; see Singer, p. 279. 

4 The absence of one is not so noticeable in the former case. 

5 So that each may say Grace for himself. 

6 Lit. scribes.

8 A nickname of R. Zera, perhaps because he was very short. See Rashi to Bab. Mesia' 85a. The Talmud (loc, cit.) narrates an incident wherein R. Zera's legs were scorched during an act of self-immolation. See A. P. A. III. p. 7 n. 2 where it is suggested that the truer reading is to be found in Sanh. 37 a, viz. "The scorched one (i.e. dark complexioned) with short legs."

2 Lit. with a fine eye. 

3 I.e. landed property. There is a variant "in all his works" which Bacher prefers ; ct A. T. ii. p. 464 n. 4. 

4 In which he dwells, so that he can keep constantly in touch with them and it be unnecessary for him to face the perils of a journey. 

5 If one interrupts his meal to enable the other two to say Grace with Zimmun, at what point may he resume ? So explain Tosafot. According to Rashi it means : How much has to be said in addition to the usual Grace because of the Zimmun? 

6 I.e. "We will bless Him of Whose bounty we have partaken," to which the response is made "Blessed be He of Whose bounty" etc., Singer, p. 279. 

7 The end of the first benediction, ibid. p. 280. Tosafot object to Rashi's explanation (see note 5 above) that this benediction is an essential part of the Grace even for an individual, so how could it be only included when there is Zimmun? 

8 This is the translation required by the explanation of Tosafot ; viz., Grace can be said by two or three, in the case where one of the diners is acquainted with one benediction and the other person or persons with the 

=====================================================

Page: 297
----------
remaining two. Each says what he knows, and all thereby fulfil their obligation. Or it can be said by three or four ; i.e. one may be acquainted with the Zimmun formula and the first benediction, and two others with one benediction each, or each one of the four with one portion. According to Rashi, the text should be rendered : The Grace after meals consists of two [benedictions, viz. when two eat together and there is no Zimmun] or of three [benedictions, viz. when three eat together. This is on the supposition that the Zimmun formula extends to the end of the first benediction] ; and there is another teaching : It consists of three [benedictions, viz. when two eat together] or four [benedictions, viz. when the Zimmun formula is added]. Apart from the objection mentioned in the preceding note, Tusafot point out that the numerals "two, three, four" are grammatically to be connected with a masculine noun (viz. men) and not a feminine word (viz. benedictions). 


1 I.e. the fourth benediction in Singer, p. 283, which is not to be considered in this connection. 

2 They compress the second and third benedictions into one ; thus, when two labourers say Grace, they say two benedictions, and when three, they say three. 

3 This fourth benediction is accordingly an essential part of the Grace, and gives something to a fourth man to say, even though the Zimmun formula includes the first benediction. 

4 But they cannot ignore an ordinance of the Torah.

1 M. reverses the authors of this and the preceding sentences. 

2 If it were ordained by the Torah, it would be connected with what precedes, and would not require "Blessed" as its opening word. 

3 See, e.g., the benedictions to be said before putting on the Tallit and Tefillin; Singer, pp. 14, 16. 

4 But they cannot ignore an ordinance of the Torah.

1 According to Rashi, the question refers to the man who stopped his meal in order to be included for Zimmun with two others. Since, in Rab Sheshet's view, be joins with them up to the end of the first benediction, where should be resume his Grace? According to Tosafot, it refers to the man who is leading the Grace with Zimmun. After the others have responded "Blessed be He of Whose bounty we have partaken, and through Whose goodness we live," where does he go on ? 

2 On Rashi's interpretation, to the beginning of the first benediction ; but on that of Tosafot, he repeats his own formula with an addition, viz. "We will bless Him of Whose bounty we have partaken and through Whose goodness we live." 

3 According to Rashi, he starts the second benediction ; according to Tosafot, he resumes the response of the others : "Blessed be He of Whose bounty" etc. Cf. Singer, p. 280, line 2 of Hebrew. 

4 Rashi omits the word "old." 

5 It is apparently to be understood that Persian etiquette forbade speaking at table; cf. T.A. in. p. 7. Jews also observed silence during a meal; see ibid. p. 267 n. 400. 

6 I.e. do nothing.

5 The regulations connected with the breaking of the bread, since the honour was given to a bridegroom. 

6 The response is considered part of the benediction. 

7 I.e. if he allows much time to elapse between saying the benediction and breaking the bread ; therefore Rab Hisda is satisfied if the majority say "Amen." 

8 I.e. "'men." 

9 I.e. "Ame-." 

10 I.e. saying "Amen" without having heard the benediction to which it is the response.

1 Before Rab Shimi entered, and therefore he could not join in Grace with them. 

2 Rab's name. The Talmud mentions here their favourite dishes. 

3 Therefore the meal cannot be considered as ended, and Rab Shimi may be included for Grace. 

4 Some edd. read "Rab Aha" incorrectly. 

5 And he obtains the privilege of joining with Zimmun by means of something that is forbidden. 

6 I.e. billeted troops. 

7 But the Halakah is not in agreement with Bet Shammai. 

8 Since the first tithe from which Terumah has been taken is allowable, it is obvious that one who has eaten it may be included for Zimmun. Why does the Mishnah mention it? 

9 This great Terumah was due to the priest ; cf. Num. xviii. 8 ff., and should be separated from the produce before the tithe is taken. If, however, the order had been reversed, it would not invalidate a man from being included for Zimmun.

1 Before the corn is ground. 

2 The Biblical text reads : "Out of all that is given you" not "all your tithes." 

3 In drawing a distinction between the ears and the corn-heap. 

4 According to Deut. xviii. 4 "the first-fruits of the corn" were the portion of the priest ; therefore the Terumah would be due from the corn-heap, but not from the ears which are no longer called "corn." 

5 Since the Temple-property had been redeemed, why should he not be included? 

6 See Lev. v. 16. 

7 Since he has eaten sufficient to necessitate Grace. 

8 With the other diners, since he is continually going backward and forward and should not be included with them. 

9 I.e. his every-day sustenance. 

10 The Samaritans were the people of mixed origin with whom the Assyrians had repopulated North Palestine after driving the Israelite inhabitants into exile. In course of time they came to look upon themselves as a part of the Jewish people and claimed the right to share in the rebuilding of the Temple. When this right was contested, they broke away and formed a separate Community, taking with them the Pentateuch.

3 And thus derived the teachings from their lips. 

4 Halakic commentaries on Leviticus, and Numbers and Deuteronomy respectively. 

5 And in the view of Rammi b. Hamma, Rab Menashya came within this class. 

6 According to Demai v. 10, that which grows in a perforated pot, placed in the ground, is legally like that which grows in the ground. But if something grows in an unperforated pot, is that to be considered as growing in the soil and subject to the tithe ? The Rabbis say it is, and one who eats of this untithed should not be included for Zimmun. 

=====================================================

----------
1 See fol. 47a, bot., and top of fol. 47 b, p. 303. 

2 That the tithe should be exempt from the great Terumah and permissible to be eaten, and therefore such an one should be included for Zimmun. 

3 That it is subject to the great Terumah, and one is forbidden to eat of the tithe unless this Terumah is separated ; and hence, he who eats thereof should not be included. 

4 The word for "Thou shalt bind" (***) is here connected with *** "stamp, image." 

5 This is the reading of the Biblical text, which the Talmud does not quote verbally, but as follows: "And he shall give the money, and it shall be assured to him." 

6 Because anybody who eats less than the size of an olive is exempt from saying the Grace. 

7 See p. 291 n. 5.

3 To hold a Congregational service for which a minimum of ten males over the age of 13 is required. 

4 And that is forbidden. 

5 And not the individual. Since the freeing of the slave enables nine men to have a Congregational service, it is permitted. 

6 I.e. the chest in the Synagogue where the Scrolls of the Law are deposited. See Oesterley and Box, p. 338. According to Azulay (quoted by Goldschmidt, p. 171) *** "and the Ark" is really the initial letters of four words: *** *** *** *** "And One Who sees but is invisible," referring to the Divine Presence in the Synagogue. There may be here a reference to the custom of giving a minor a Scroll of the Law to hold, and thereby including him in the quorum ; cf. Low, Lebensalter, p. 208 and p. 409 n. 46. 

=====================================================

1 Ie. when the nine are seated close together, without actually counting them, it is not possible to notice that there is one short. Therefore, including the presence of the Ark, the Congregational service may be held. The alternative version supposes that it is easier to detect the absence of one when the nine are seated close together. 

2 Pineles (quoted by Goldschmidt, loc. cit.) thinks that *** is the initial letters of *** *** *** "[Two] who study words of Torah [together]." 

3 M.: Rab Hisda said in the name of R. Johanan. 

4 Lit. who produced two hairs. 

5 Although he has reached the age of puberty, i.e. 13 years. 

6 He may be included whether he shows signs of puberty or not. 

7 M.: Rab b. R. Hanan. D.S. thinks the correct reading is Raba b. R. Hanan which is accepted by Hyman, iii. p. 1041 a, and Bacher, A. B. A. (2nd ed.) add. p. 12.

4 Who ate corn-food and two or three who ate vegetables. 

5 Edd. insert the word "certainly" which the commentators find difficulty in explaining. M. omits it. 

6 That it is allowed with seven and three. 

7 Which is apparent with seven and three but not with six and four. 

8 Viz. the Pharisees of whom Alexander Jannaeus was a bitter opponent. 

9 Who was a leader of the Pharisaic party and had been in hiding. 

10 In J.T. : For it is written iu the Book of Ben Sira, "Exalt her and she will raise thee and make thee to sit among great men." No such verse occurs in Ecclesiasticus. The first clause is from Prov. iv. 8 and the second is a reminiscence of Ecclus. xi. 1. The earlier part of the incident between Simeon b. Shetah and Jannaeus, especially the cause of the former's flight, is differently told in J. T. 

11 The Pharisees. 

12 Since Simeon b. Shetah denied that the king had the power to honour him, Jannaeus took this as evidence that the Pharisees were disloyal to the throne. Some edd. read : The king said to her, " Thou seest he [i.e. Simeon] does not accept lordship." He meant to point out to the Queen that her attempt to bring about a rapprochement between him and the Pharisees was futile.

8 The first benediction of the Grace ; Singer, p. 280.

2 See p. 111 n. 1. 

3 The town of Bethar, near Sepphoris, was the scene of the last stand of the Jews against the Romans in 135 C.E. The name is probably derived from the Latin Vetera (sc. castra); cf. Krauss, p. 153, 

4 During the long period in which the Jews could not bury their dead. 

5 The benediction of consolation is the third, beginning "Have mercy" ; see Singer, p. 281 for the Sabbath formula. 

6 Why is their opinion separately stated if it agrees with that of the first Tanna? 

7 See p. 96 n. 2. In the view of the Babbis, if the man included the reference to the Sabbath in a benediction other than the "Consolation," he must restart at the commencement. The first Tanna, on the other hand, only requires it in the "Consolation" ab initio, but if he included it in another benediction, post factum it is to be allowed. 

=====================================================

2 Some edd. incorrectly insert here : "It [i.e. the a fortiori argument] is unnecessary." 

3 See fol. 45 a, p. 291. 

4 I.e. even before enjoying His gift, before partaking thereof, offer Him a benediction. 

5 Over which the benediction has to be said. 

6 Hence Grace before meals is required by the Torah. 

7 M. adds : b. Assi. D. S. thinks the correct reading is R. Nathan b. R. Joseph. 

8 From this passage it is clear that Grace before meals is necessary. 

9 Why did the women of whom Saul inquired the way to Samuel's house give him such a long and involved reply ? 

10 M. inserts: Rab said: Hence it is derived that women, etc. 

11 I.e. the Amora of that name. 

12 As soon as Saul would meet Samuel, the latter's rule of the people would come to an end ; and as the predestined hour had not arrived yet, the women detained Saul until the ordained time.

1 Dependent upon food. 

2 Dependent upon the knowledge and practice of Torah. M. reads: for eternal life. 

3 M.: Abba. 

4 From the common use of the verb "to give," a Gezerah Shawah (see p. 18 n. 5) is drawn — if a benediction is required for the land (cf. the second paragraph of the Grace) given by God, likewise is a benediction required for the Torah given by Him. 

5 Cf . fol. 54 a, p. 348. 

6 R. Meir's explanation is based upon the teaching of the Rabbis that JHWH "the Lord" is the Deity in His attribute of mercy, and Elohim "God" represents Him as Judge. In Deut. xxvi. 11 both names occur. 

7 In the first passage the definite article is wanting. 

8 Lit.: the good. 

9 As a benediction is required for the latter, so also for the former. 

10 M. omits "Eliezer" and hence intends R. Judah the Prince as the author. 

11 Sc. of circumcision ; see Singer, p. 280, "As well as for Thy covenant which Thou hast sealed in our flesh." 

12 Ibid. "Thy Law which Thou hast taught us."

----------
1 Torah was given to Israel in three places — Sinai, Mt Gerizim and the plains of Moab, in each of which localities a covenant was entered into ; cf. Dent, xxvii. 11 ff., xxviii. 69. In the passage dealing with the law of circumcision. Gen. xvii, the word for "covenant" occurs 13 times. 

2 Rab is here intended. 

3 It opens with "We thank Thee," etc., Singer, p. 280 and concludes "For all this... we thank and bless Thee," ibid. p. 281. 

4 So J. T. probably correctly (see Hyman, I. p. 15 a). Edd.: Jacob b. Aha. M.: that R. Aha said in the name of the Rabbis. "Our master" here means Rab. 

5 M.: R. Dosa. 

6 In the opening sentence, viz. "King of the Universe" ; cf. Singer, p. 283 top. 

7 See the discussion on fol. 46 a, pp. 297 f. If it is held that this benediction is Rabbinic, then it is distinct from what precedes (which is from the Torah), and being a separate benediction requires the reference to the Kingship, because without it a benediction is not complete. Cf. above, fol. 40 b, p. 267. 

8 And not being a separate benediction, it does not require a reference to the Kingship. 

=====================================================

Page: 314
----------

1 M.: R. Joshua says. 

2 This is the reading of M. Edd.: "and not refer to the rebuilding of Jerusalem." 

3 When saying the third benediction, he omitted either "upon Israel Thy people" or "upon Jerusalem Thy city," but concluded "Who savest Israel and... rebuildest Jerusalem." 

4 The conclusion of the second benediction, which contains two items. 

5 Hence they are really one idea. 

6 See Singer, p. 289 top. 

7 Ibid. p. 229 bot. 

8 Ibid. p. 226 bot. 

9 In being permitted, whereas "Who savest Israel and... rebuildest Jerusalem" is not. 

10 I.e. we must have a separate benediction for each religious act. 

11 M. adds : b. Isaac.

1 Therefore it is the rebuilding of Jerusalem which should be the constant prayer, since the rest depends upon that. 

2 M.: Zeira. 

3 To express astonishment. 

4 Who require these references to be included. 

5 That is why Rab Sheshet showed astonishment. 

6 See fol. 40 b, p. 267.

8 To constitute it a benediction.

8 Mt Scopus, on the North outskirt of Jerusalem.

1 The standards required here, so far as the two Rabbis are concerned, are the reverse of those mentioned in our Mishnah. 

2 In the quoted Mishnah, the minimum of the olive must be ascribed to R. Meir and vice versa. 

3 On the question of Grace after meals. 

4 Of the holy flesh. 

5 Nothing less than the size of an egg can cause defilement. 

6 To eat leaven on Passover less than the size of an olive does not constitute a breach of the law. 

7 This is R. 'Akiba's view which has been adopted. See Singer, p. 279. What follows is the opinion of R. Jose.

3 Into two parties of three, so that each arranges Zimmun. 

4 Ten should not be divided up, because ten are required for the addition of "our God" to the formula. 

5 If the six are divided into two parties of three, there will not be four for the formula "Bless ye." 

6 Viz. that in our Mishnah, the phrase "Bless ye" means "Bless ye also." 

7 Because both phrases include the speaker.

1 Because "from" implies only part of the Divine goodness, as though we were not entirely dependent upon His goodness. 

2 We must be humble in asking for the Divine blessing and not, as it were, demand the whole of it ; therefore the use of "from" is justifiable. But in the Grace we make a declaration, and so "from" is out of place. 

3 In asking for the Divine blessing, i.e. ask for much and there is no need to be humble in petitioning God. 

4 This request is for spiritual things, not material good. 

5 According to Neubauer, p. 395, it is a contraction of Nahr Bull, a Babylonian town on the river Divalah. Wiesner, p. 109, identifies it with Nahr Obolla, a tributary of the Euphrates near ancient Basra. 

6 Their objection to "we live" was that it excluded the rest of mankind, whereas "they" means humanity generally. 

7 Because this formula might be referred to the host, not God. 

8 M. omits : b. Raba. 

9 In the Passover Ritual. 

10 By specifying "food," it might be thought that he is referring to the host ; but we have to thank God for much else beside food. 

11 With ten the formula is "Blessed be our God" ; therefore it cannot possibly be understood of the host.

1 Here "food" is mentioned ; but no exception can be taken because the Deity is explicitly referred to. 

2 For the purpose of the Zimmun formula. 

3 Meaning everybody present, without exception, even the unborn babes. 

4 R. Jose, whence does he derive this teaching, since he uses "full assemblies" as in the Mishnah ? 

5 As implying the womb. 

6 So that ten or ten myriads have the same formula. 

7 The assembly being very large and the meal prolonged, when three who sit together finish, they say Grace quietly between themselves. 

8 So as to add "our God" to the formula. 

9 If they had said Grace in parties of ten, it would have been more conspicuous and a louder tone of voice would have been required. The Exilarch might then have noticed what they were doing and regard it as a slight that they had not waited for him to say Grace.

2 I.e. three parties which have had the meal but not yet said Grace. 

3 Consequently the three who have come together were originally under the obligation of Zimmun. 

4 If, e.g., each party had consisted of four persons, and one of each party came together, then these three men must have Zimmun for themselves. 

5 I.e. each party started to say Grace and after the Zimmun formula had been said, one man left. Should three of these come together, they cannot finish their Grace with Zimmun. 

6 An incomplete article cannot contract defilement.

2 If, e.g., his hands are stained and he has nothing else with which to wipe them, he may rub them with a piece of bread. The Greeks also wiped their hands with bread, but the Romans had water passed round for the purpose ; D.C.A. p. 384. 

3 Since he allowed undiluted wine for washing the hands. The Rabbis object because it involves spoiling foodstuff, and for the same reason they would object to bread being used for cleaning the hands.

2 The Greek word ***, which is not identical in meaning with what is now called "asparagus." It is the name given to the young shoots of various plants (see Krauss, pp. 93 f.). Brecher, Das Transcendentale...im Talmud, p. 181 n. 127, connects the word with the Latin purgans and renders "Purgiertrank" ; but this is improbable. The beverage referred to here is the "heart" of the cabbage brewed with wine or beer. By "beer" is intended a brew of figs or dates.

6 The word for "and with undiluted wine" seems out of place and yields no sense. The commentators find it difficult to explain. M. omits it, reading : R. Hanan said in the name of Rab Sheshet.  

7 The wine must remain undiluted up to that point in the Grace, and then water is added.
