2 Who bad become ritually unclean and, after bathing, waited until the evening before they could eat "of the holy things" (cf. Lev. xxii. 4-7). 

3 Whether the night is divisible into three or four watches will be discussed in the Gemara below : see pp. 6, 9 f. 

4 The majority of the Rabbis. 

5 According to Maimonides, in his Commentary on the Mishnah, this refers to the first light which becomes visible in the East, about 1 1/5 hours before actual sunrise. Cf. Pesah. 93 b. 

6 Cf. Leviticus vi. and vii. 

7 Cf. ibid. vii. 15 ff. 

8 Lit. Where does the Tanna stand that he teaches, From what time ?

1 Two deductions are drawn from the verse : (1) The law of reading the Shema' since the Israelite is commanded "to talk of them" (viz. "these words which I command thee this day") on lying down and rising up ; (2) The right order is "lying down" and "rising up," i.e. evening and morning. 

2 Hence the Jews reckon the day as commencing with the evening that precedes. See T. A. II. p. 418. 

3 See below, p. 70. 

4 In Mishnah II of this chapter, p. 55. 

5 By defining the time for reading the evening Shema' as the time when the priests partake of their Terumah, the Mishnah wishes it to be understood that the priests who have been unclean regain their privilege at sunset (when the Shema' is read) whether they bring their sin-offering or not. 

6 The Gemara requires the translation "it (the day) is clean," i.e. ended, and not "he (the man) shall be clean" from his impurity. 

7 Meaning, the fact that the sun had not set. 

===========================================================

1 I.e. the appearance of the stars. 

2 I.e. the disappearance of the sun below the horizon, but not the appearance of the stars. So Tosafot ; Rashi, less probably, refers Lev, xxii. 7 to the dawn of the eighth day. 

3 I.e. "then he shall be clean," whereas wetaher means "it (or he) is clean." 

4 The Palestinian Schools, from the geographical standpoint of Babylon. 

5 When the priests may partake of the Terumah. 

6 On account of his poverty, he cannot afford artificial light ; therefore he takes his evening meal while there is yet sufiScient light. See fol. 3 a (p. 7) for a reference to sleeping in a dark room ; and on fol. 5 b (p. 24) it is mentioned that R. Eleazar, who was very poor, was lying in a dark room. According to Lane, p. 145, Orientals have their supper "shortly after sunset." In J. T. it is mentioned that the inhabitants of villages leave the fields before nightfall for fear of wild beasts. 

7 The terminus ad quern does not agree with any of the views stated in the Mishnah.

1 The meal would be earlier on the Sabbath-eve, everything having been prepared before the advent of the Sabbath. 

2 See p. 1 n. 2. 

3 Viz. that the day ends with the appearance of the stars. 

4 M. reads : but on account of the building of the Temple they started early and worked late. 

5 "Come and hear" introduces a quotation or illustration, often with the object of refuting an argument. Its use in the present instance is as follows : According to Neh. iv. 15, the day-shift of workers laboured from "the rising of the morning" (i.e. dawn) until "the stars appeared." These two points of time may be regarded as defining the beginning and end of a day. But should it be objected that no such inference can be drawn, inasmuch as the workmen in their enthusiasm may have exceeded the normal hours of the day, the objection is met by v. 16, where it is explicitly stated "and may labour in the day." The conclusion, therefore, is that a normal day is intended in V. 15. 

6 I.e. the poor man (mentioned in the first Baraita) who has his evening meal early through lack of artificial light, and people generally (mentioned in the second) on the Sabbath-eve who have their supper early. 

7 The reasoning may be simplified by calling the meal-time of the poor man A, that of people on the Sabbath-eve B, and that of the priest for partaking of the Terumah C. In this paragraph A is assumed to equal B. If, then, A is said to equal C, then B = C. But R. Meir, who adopts B, is contrasted with the Sages who adopt C, so these cannot be identical. 

===========================================================

1 And it is agreed by all that the evening Shema' must not be read in the daytime. This question is dealt with below. 

2 R. Hannina adopts A and R. Joshua adopts C. According to the hypothesis A = C; but that cannot be, since these two Rabbis hold divergent views. 

3 The time-standards of the poor man and the priest. 

4 M. inserts: Rab Nahman b. Isaac said. 

5 There is not sufficient data in the Gemara to account for this conclusion. Tosafot note the difficulty. 

6 In Shab. 34 b R. Judah defines "twilight" thus: From the time the sun sets and so long as the sky in the East is coloured red. When the lower horizon is pale but not the upper horizon, it is still twilight; but when the upper horizon is pale like the lower, it is night. Cf. Lane, p. 74 n. 2. 

7 Should, therefore, the priest bathe about the time of twilight (according to B. Jose's view), although it is still day, it is legitimate to read the Shema' then, since it is practically night. 

===========================================================
Page: 6
---------

1 In the first Baraita quoted, R. Meir's view is that the Shema' may be read from the time people go home for their meal on the Sabbath-eve (i.e. after twilight) ; but in the second Baraita his view is from the time the priest bathes (i.e. before twilight). 

2 R. Meir's teaching is reported by two later Rabbis ; hence the discrepancy. 

3 In the Mishnah, R. Eliezer's time-standard is when the priests enter to eat the Terumah (i.e. the appearance of the stars) ; in the Baraita, it is when the Sabbath is hallowed (i.e. sunset). 

4 According to this explanation, only "until the end of the first watch" in the Mishnah are the words of R. Eliezer. 

5 The division of the day was reckoned as follows : From sunrise to sunset consisted of twelve "hours," which would be longer in Summer and shorter in Winter. The sixth hour ended at noon ; hence it is convenient to speak of the day as commencing at 6 a.m., and the night (which was similarly divided into twelve hours) at 6 p.m. "Until the end of the fourth hour" would accordingly be 10 p.m. 

6 The Romans divided the night into four vigiliae. So also Matt. xiv. 25, Mark vi. 48. 

7 The ministering angels are formed into three bands, each doing duty a part of the night. 

8 See Glossary, s.v. Baraita. 

9 "Mightily roar" is literally in the Hebrew "roaring He doth roar." Hence the word "roar" occurs three times in the verse, and is referred to the three night-watches.

2 M. : Rab Isaac b. R. Samuel b. Marta. 

3 It will be noted that the Talmud is careful to trace a teaching to its source; hence the frequent occurrence of the phrase "in the name of." Cf. Abot vi. 6 : "Whoever reports a thing in the name of him that said it brings deliverance into the world; as it is said, 'And Esther told the king in the name of Mordecai' (Esth. ii. 22)" (Singer, p. 207).

5 Elijah is frequently represented in Rabbinic Literature as appearing on earth. See A. T. II. p. 163 n. 1, and the article in J. E. v. pp. 122 ff. 

6 By "prayer" is usually, as here, meant the Eighteen Benedictions (see Glossary, s.v. Tefillah). This prayer must be said with the feet in a fixed position (see fol. 10 b, p. 65 n. 6) and without interruption.

2 For the bearing of this passage on Matt. iii. 16, see Abrahams, Studies in Pharisaism (First Series), p. 47. 

3 The original reading was probably, "Woe to Me that I have destroyed," etc. See D. S. ad loc. The alteration was made for the purpose of euphemism. 

4 This is the response in the important feature of the Synagogue Service, known as the Kaddish. Cf., e.g., Singer, p. 37, and p. 86 for the form used in the House of Study. On the Kaddish, see J. E. VII. pp. 401 ff.

3 In J. T., R. Nathan is answered: There are four watches, but the first is not counted because people are generally still awake. 

4 M. : R. Simeon b. Lakish. Bacher adopts this as correct ; see A. P. A. I. p. 131 n. 5. 

5 If by rising "at midnight" David forestalled "night-watches" (the plural signifying two), there must be four watches in the night.

1 If the day of royal personages commences with the beginning of the third hour (i.e. 8 a.m.), by rising at midnight David forestalled them by eight hours. Therefore a "watch" consists of four hours and there are three in the night. 

2 This is an alternative answer to uphold R. Nathan's view. By "watches" is not necessarily to be understood two complete periods of time. 

3 M.: R. Simeon b. Lakish. Bacher adopts this as correct; see A. P. A. I. p. 131 n. 5. 

4 To be an auditor of a discussion on Torah and not take part in it was a mark of ignorance and one incurred shame thereby. The dead, being unable to participate, although for other reasons, would thus be disgraced. The idea will not seem so fantastic in view of the belief that the corpse was conscious of what transpired in its presence. Cf. the discussion on pp. 120 ff. 

5 R.V. "at dawn"; but the Talmud wishes to give it the meaning of "evening." See the discussion in this and the following paragraphs. 

6 In place of "in the name of R. Aha," M. reads: Another version: R. Eleazar said in the name of R. Osha'ya. 

7 This is taken to be the meaning of Ps. cxix. 62, and therefore David rose before midnight. 

8 The horse was known to be a light sleeper. According to Sukkah 26 b its sleep consisted of only 60 respirations. 

9 Cf. Abot V. 23: "Judah b. Tema said : Be strong as a leopard, light as an eagle, fleet as a hart, and strong as a lion, to do the will of thy Father Who is in heaven" (Singer, p. 203).

5 Let the rich help the poor. 

6 The poor cannot remain satisfied with charitable doles, any more than a handful will satisfy a hungry lion. Moreover a nation needs external sources of supply. It cannot live on itself, just as the soil taken out of a pit will not completely fill the cavity. Others render the proverb: "A grasshopper cannot satisfy a lion ; nor can a cistern be filled by rain-water [but must also depend upon drawn water]"; cf. T. A. I. p. 419 n. 17.

1 Objects connected with the High Priest's breastplate, used as a divine oracle by means of which questions were answered. See J. E. xii. p. 384. 

2 This reading of edd. "Benaiah the son of Jehoiada" agrees with II Sam. XX. 23. The Hebrew text of Chronicles reads "Jehoiada the son of Benaiah" which is also the reading of M. here. 

3 He being the High Priest. 

4 The text of M. has been followed, which is supported by the Tosafist, Rabbenu Tam. Edd. insert "Abiathar denotes the Urim and Tummim" after the word "Sanhedrin"; and accordingly the explanation of the Kereti and Peleti is referred to the Urim and Tummim. 

5 M. adds : Why are they called Urim and Tummim ? They are called Urim because they give their answers clearly, and Tummim because they fulfil their words ; i.e. what they foretell comes to pass. This explanation is given in Joma 73 b.

4 So M. Edd. read "stained with [menstrual] blood, with foetus and placenta." In certain cases an abortive embryo would not make a woman liable to the restrictions of Lev. xii. 2 ff., and David is represented as deciding such a question as this instead of feasting. 

5 Cf. II Sam. ix. 13 where it is stated, "But Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem ; for he did eat continually at the king's table." This is the only reference to intimate relations existing between them.

1 See I Chron. iii. 1, as compared with II Sam. iii. 3. In a very interesting article in R. E. J. XXVIII. pp. 60 ff., Buchler suggests that under the guise of Biblical names (of. Dryden's Absalom and Achitophel) we have an echo of the quarrel between the Patriarch, Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel and R. Nathan and R. Meir. These two Rabbis (i.e. Mephibosheth) attempted to belittle the Halakic knowledge of Rabban Simeon (i.e. David) ; but his adversaries found more than their match in R. Judah his son (i.e. Chileab). On the quarrel, see Weiss, Dor (ed. 1904), II. p. 157. 

2 The name is explained as maklim "putting to shame" ab "a father," i.e. a teacher, Mephibosheth.

5 Therefore David was doubtful whether he deserved to be included with the righteous, so how could he describe himself as "godly "? 

6 The answer is he felt himself to be "godly," but feared that the sins he had committed would more than counterbalance the general righteousness of his life.

1 Their return depended upon the permission of Cyrus and not divine intervention. 

2 R. Eliezer's view "Until the end of the first watch" is based upon the following interpretation of "when thou liest down," viz. the Shema' is to be read about the time a person thinks of retiring to bed. Rabban Gamaliel's view, "Until the rise of dawn" follows from a different interpretation, viz. the Shema' may be read any time during the period given over to sleep. Which interpretation is adopted by the Sages ? Their view "Until midnight" seems to follow neither. It must be remembered that in the Orient, people retire to rest at a rather early hour. Lane says, "The Egyptian is a very early riser, and he retires to sleep at an early hour" (p. 137), and this may be taken to be typical of Orientals. 

3 Cf. Abot i. 1 : Make a fence round the Torah (Singer, p. 184), i.e. "impose additional restrictions so as to keep at a safe distance from forbidden ground" (Taylor, Sayings of the Fathers, in loc.). 

4 The antiquity of many a Baraita may be seen from the fact that by a labourer is usually intended an agricultural workman. Cf. also fol. 17 a, p. 111. 

5 Fortified by the thought that the Shema' may be read any time before dawn, he will put it off and in this way come to omit it altogether. 

6 The Torah as expounded in the Schools. 

===========================================================

1 Therefore the Sages deemed it necessary to emphasise the warning, because his transgression might otherwise be involuntary. 

2 This question is referred to below, fol. 27 b, p. 180. 

3 That is to say, the benediction "Blessed... Who hast redeemed Israel" (Singer, p. 99) should be immediately followed by the Eighteen Benedictions (ibid. pp. 44-54). This order is supported by the quotation "Then let him read the Shema' and say the Tefillah," as against R. Joshua b. Levi's opinion that in the evening the Shema' should follow the Tefillah. On the idea of joining the Ge'ullah and the Tefillah, see below fol. 9 b, p. 66 n. 7. 

4 I.e. between the morning and evening recital of the Shema' ; hence in the evening, the Tefillah would come first. 

5 Therefore we should have the prayers referring to the deliverance (Singer, pp. 98 f.) and then the benedictions. But R. Joshua b. Levi only regards the deliverance as having taken place after midnight; consequently R. Johanan's reason does not apply. 

===========================================================

1 The order being : leaving the bed, Shema', Tefillah; so at night the order must be reversed: Tefillah, Shema', retiring to bed. 

2 See below, p. 70. 

3 Singer, p. 99. This prayer interrupts the connection of "Who hast redeemed Israel" and the Eighteen Benedictions. The prayer, "Blessed be the Lord for evermore" (ibid. p. 100) is a later addition to the Service. See Elbogen, Der judische Gottesdienst, pp. 102 f. 

4 Lit. a long Ge'ullah. 

5 Singer, p. 44. These words might be regarded as constituting an interruption. 

6 So M. Edd. : R. Eleazar said in the name of R. Abina. 

7 Twice in the morning service and once in the afternoon. See Abrahams, p. xxxvi.

4 Lit. "being caused to fly in a flight," the word for "flying" occurring twice. This is interpreted that he covered the distance in two flights, resting in between ; whereas the verse in Isaiah speaks only of one flight. 

5 This argument is known as Gezerah Shawah, "analogy of expression." See Mielziner, pp. 142 ff., especially pp. 148 ff. where the safeguards against the exorbitant use of the argument are explained.

3 Of the Torah it is said, "And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be upon thy heart" (Deut. vi. 6). 

4 The Shema' was to be read "when thou liest down" (Deut. vi. 7).

===========================================================

---------
1 "Sons of Reshef" in the English version is "sparks." The ancient Jewish Aramaic version, the Targum, renders it "the sons of evil spirits." 

2 The root of this word is 'uf, "to fly." The verse is appHed to Torah: "Wilt thou cause thine eyes to fly upon it [i.e. neglect it]? It is gone [from thy mind]." 

3 The Targum here renders Reshef by "birds"; so LXX in Job v. 7. But "bitter destruction " is rendered by "attacked by evil spirits." According to a statement in Pesahim 111 b, Kefeb meriri "bitter destruction" is the name of an evil spirit which is active about the time of noon. It is probably heat personified ; cf. T. A . III. p. 346 n. 131. 

4 The teaching is explicitly inculcated in the Torah in a passage known to school-children. Why, then, derive it from obscure verses? 

5 This is what R. Simeon meant to teach, and it cannot be deduced from Exod. xv. 26. 

6 M. adds: Another version in the West: in the name of R. Abba b. Mari. This is probably an error for Raba b. Mari; cf. D.S. ad loc.

2 He rejoiced inasmuch as He "gave" it, willingly and without price. 

3 Instead of "another version : Rab Hisda," M. reads: in the name of R. Sahorah, in the name of Rab Huna. 

4 On the Rabbinic doctrine of Retribution, see Schechter, Studies in Judaism (First Series), pp. 259 ff. 

5 The work for "restitution" is asham which also means "trespass-offering." Before the asham was offered, confession had to be made (Lev. V. 5), and therefore the sacrifice was a voluntary act. Hence the inference is drawn that the sufferings are voluntarily endured. 

===========================================================

1 The preceding verses (cf. vv. 10-12) speak of sufferings. 

2 The Rabbis frequently suggest an alteration of the Scriptural text for homiletic purposes. In the present instance, a slight change in the vowels is required. See Introduction, § v. 

3 The argument here used is called Kol wahomer, lit. "light and heavy," i.e. a fortiori or a majore ad minorem. See Mielziner, pp. 130 ff. 

4 See Exod. xxi. 26 f. 

5 If God ordained that a slave should be set free whose eye or tooth had been damaged, will He not show His mercy to His creatures who suffer more than that! 

6 The verse occurs at the end of the chapter containing the penalties threatened to Israel if disobedient to the word of God.

1 The word for "instruction," musur, comes from the same root as jisur "suffering." "The way of life" is referred to the life eternal. 

2 M.: A certain Elder of the school of R. Simeon b. Johai taught. 

3 On this mode of reasoning, see p. 18 n. 5. The early death of children is declared to be due to the wrongdoing of the parents, and the pain of their bereavement brings expiation. 

4 Enumerated in Mishnah Nega'Im i. 1. 

5 A medium of expiation. 

6 Declining to draw the fine distinction between "an altar of atonement" and "chastenings of love," an alternative answer is suggested, viz. "our," i.e. the teaching of the Babylonian Schools regards plagues as "chastenings of love," because a more lenient view was taken of them than by the Palestinian Schools, to which R. Johanan belonged. In Palestine, a plague-infected person had to be isolated outside the city (cf. Lev. xiii. 46), and therefore the consequences were too severe for the plague to be regarded as "chastenings of love." 

===========================================================
Page: 24
---------

1 When the plague affects a part of the body which is normally covered by clothing, it may be regarded as "an altar of atonement"; but when in addition to discomfort there is disfigurement visible to all, the teaching of R. Johanan applies. 

2 By "bone" the commentators understand a tooth. Ten children of R. Johanan died, and he preserved a tooth of the last to show to people who had suffered bereavement, for the purpose of inducing them to evidence the same spirit of resignation as himself. Consequently it would seem that R Johanan regarded the loss of children, but not sterility, as "chastenings of love." 

3 Cured him of his ailment by the healing touch. Cf. T. A. i. p. 267.

5 R. Johanan was famed for the beauty of his person. Cf . Baba Mesia' 84 a.

1 It Abba Benjamin prayed "before his bed" in this sense, he acted contrary to the quoted teaching. The reason why it is recommended to face the wall with nothing intervening is to avoid distraction. 

2 He used the word "before" in the sense of time, not place. Immediately on rising, he offered his prayers. 

3 To avoid facing East, the direction of the Temple and of prayer. 

4 Instead of "in the name of," M. reads: Another version. 

5 It is well known that, in the Orient, males are more valued than females. Lane, p. 58, mentions that Muhammadan women often dress their boys as girls when taking them into the street so that envious glances be not cast upon them and to avert the Evil Eye. See also Frazer, Folklore of the Old Testament, I. p. 550 and T. A. II. p. 434 n. 89. 

6 The word for "treasure" is safun, and by the change of a vowel, safon, we get the meaning "North." Cf. also fol. 61 b, where it is forbidden to perform the functions of nature towards East or West, to prevent the exposure of the body in the direction of the Temple. 

7 "A Synagogue" does not occur in edd., but is added by M. 

8 "Soul" is here used in the sense of the outpouring of the soul, prayer. The commentators compare I Sam. i. 15. 

9 Synagogues in Babylon were usually situated in a field, near a river, at some distance from the town. See J. E. xi. p. 623, Schurer, II. ii. p. 69. It was because of the danger of being attacked by footpads if alone that this regulation was made.

4 On the Sabbath, expositions of Torah were given in the Synagogues and Houses of Study. The name given to such an assembly is Kallah "the bride," because "court was paid to the Torah, and fresh declarations of love and devotion and loyalty were made to her" (Schechter, Seminary Addresses, p. 54). Wunsche (p. 12 n. 2) considers that the name is connected with the Sabbath, the day on which the gathering was held, the Sabbath being frequently referred to as a bride (cf. Singer, p. Ill bot.). The word has also been connected with *** (Page:27), schola, with elision of the first letter. Other suggested explanations are given by Abrahams, p. clix. For a description of the Kallah, see J. E. I. pp. 146 f. Although the hall was not overcrowded, yet the audience would feel crushed. This was due to the evil spirits who wished to make them uncomfortable and induce people to stay away. 

5 So M. Edd. : Who wishes to know them. 

6 Orientals regard the cock as a power of darkness, possibly because it crows in the dark. Cf. Sanh. 63b where "Succoth Benoth" (II Kings xvii. 30) is identified with the hen, and "Nergal" (ibid.) with the cock. Note also the reference to the cock's comb on fol. 7 a, p. 37.

1 The prayer referred to here is not private devotion, but the statutory service which is congregational in character, Cf. fol. 7b - 8a, pp. 43 f. 

2 That "congregation" signifies at least ten is derived from Num. xiv. 27 where the word is applied to ten of the spies. A minimum of ten adult male is required to constitute a quorum for the Service in Synagogue. See Oesterley and Box, p. 340. 

3 Elohim means "God or gods" but also "judges." See Exod. xxi. 6, R.V. marg. According to Jewish law, a case was tried by at least three judges.

2 Wiesner, p. 18, finds here an attack on sun-worshippers (cf. fol. 7a, p. 37). Rab Huna, being a Babylonian, the Ark in his Synagogue would be in the West (see fol. 30 a, p. 197); therefore to pray with the back to the Synagogue would be praying towards the rising sun. Cf. Ezek. viii. 16. 

3 In place of "Elijah... Arab," M. reads: An Arab saw him. On Elijah, see p. 7 n. 5. 

4 The text has *** which Rashi explains to mean "as if there were two divine Powers." M. has *** which yields no sense. Jastrow, p. 139, rightly reads as one word *** (Page: 32).

2 "The Holy of Holies" added by M. According to the Jewish sources, he was one of the last of the High Priests and suffered martyrdom (see fol. 57 b) with Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel the Elder. He is accordingly identified by some with Ishmael b. Phabi who held the Office about 60 c.e. This identification, however, is very uncertain, and there are scholars who doubt whether there was a High Priest of that name. They think that the person referred to here is the Tanna Ishmael, who was the son of a High Priest, and that the theosophical passages where he is mentioned (see fol. 51 a) are later legendary additions to the Talmud. See A. T. i. pp. 259-263.

1 "The mighty" means the many assembled for prayer.

Consequently the privies were to be found outside the city, often at a considerable distance, which was not only a great inconvenience but a danger to health. This fact had its effect on the Halakah; and we shall find many references to it, meaningless under modern conditions, but a serious matter in ancient times.

8 In addition to hearing the recital of the weekly lection from the Pentateuch in the Synagogue, it was a pious act to read through the Parashah at home, twice in the original and once in the Aramaic translation, the Targum.

1 The continuation of the Mishnah is "but wherever the Sages use the expression 'Until midniglit,' the obligation continues until the rise of dawn." Since Rabban Gamaliel holds that the obligation continues until the rise of dawn, it might be supposed that he also teaches "until midnight." 

2 To which the same law applies. 

3 I.e. until the time of hastening out of Egypt, viz. dawn; cf. "And none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning" (Exod. xii. 22). Therefore R. 'Akiba rejects the other's argument which makes "in that night" mean "until midnight."

4 See Mishnah Zebahim, v. 8 (Singer, p. 13), and for the peace offering, ibid. § 7. 

5 How does he know that the Paschal offering may not be eaten two nights and a day? He cannot derive it from "in that night," since he has used the phrase for the purpose of drawing the analogy.

8 The point of variance between R. Eleazar b. 'Azariah and B. 'Akiba also divides R. Eliezer and R. Joshua.

7 Therefore R. Johanan's teaching cannot apply to the evening Tefilluh, because "O Lord, open Thou my lips" would constitute an interruption. The importance which this Rabbi attached to uniting the two prayers in the evening is accounted for by Elbogen (J. Q. R. xix. pp. 711 ff.) on the theory that it was intended to abolish the custom of introducing prayers of a personal nature after the Shema' which was likely to destroy the congregational character of the Service. Cf. fol. 31a, p. 206.

1 This is a reference to II Ghron. xxx. 2 where it is mentioned that he observed the Passover in the second month. According to the Talmud, he had made a mistake in intercalation. The Hebrew month is lunar and lasts 29 or 30 days. Whether the 30th day was to be regarded as the last day of the month or the first of the new month depended upon observation of the New Moon (cf. Lane, p. 478). For the purpose of periodically adjusting the lunar and solar year (so that, e.g., the Passover which must be observed in the Spring should not occur in the Summer), an extra month was intercalated between Adar and Nisan seven times in nineteen years. On the Jewish Calendar, see J. E. III. p. 498, Oesterley and Box, pp. 346 ff. 

2 I.e. the month having once been proclaimed Nisan, it cannot be intercalated. 

3 By "Samuel" is meant the Amora of that name. He taught that if the year is to be intercalated, it must be announced before the 30th of Addr, since witnesses might come to testify that the New Moon had been observed on that day, and it would accordingly be reckoned as the 1st of Nisan. Hezekiah, however, thought that the 30th of Adar could never be reckoned as the 1st of Nisan. He therefore intercalated the year on that day, which afterwards proved to be the New Moon, with the consequence that he observed the Passover in the second month instead of in the first.

5 What explanation do they offer of "When thou walkest" as distinct from "when walking"? Bet Shammai had explained "when thou walkest" as excluding one occupied with a religious duty; but, according to the Gemara, "when walking" implies that.

1 E.g. two blessings have to precede the recital of the Shema'. If the first were said but the second omitted, then the omission of the second does not invalidate the first. All that R. Zerika said was that the practice of the priests in the Temple illustrated this principle ; and from this statement the conclusion was drawn that the benediction recited was "Who formest light." 

2 This Service in the Temple was before daybreak. 

3 Why was Rab Isaac b. Joseph so careful to mention that R. Zerika's opinion depended only on an inference and not explicit teaching? 

4 Not the omission of a benediction; i.e. the principle "The benedictions do not invalidate one another" might have been taken to mean that the saying of "With abounding love" first (for the reason that it was not yet daybreak) followed by "Who formest light" was not invalidated because of the inverse order. But this inference would be incorrect.

5 Instead of concluding "Blessed... Creator of the luminaries" (Singer, p. 39) he wrongly says the formula of the evening prayer (ibid. p. 96). 

6 He wrongly commenced with the evening prayer, and when about to conclude it notices the error and ends it with the correct formula. 

7 The benediction is correct but the conclusion wrong. 

===========================================================
Page: 75
---------
1 The benediction is wrong but the conclusion correct. 

2 Are we, by analogy, to apply this rule to the instance of wine and beer? 

3 The addition of "Blessed art Thou, O Lord" constitutes what follows a complete benediction in itself, quite irrespective of what precedes. For that reason, although the main theme was wrong, so long as the concluding benediction is correct, the requirement of the law has been fulfilled. The instance of wine and beer is different, because he began the benediction for wine and in the middle noticed the error, but the words which followed did not constitute a complete benediction. 

4 The formula "Blessed... Creator of the luminaries" contains the divine Name and is, according to Rab, a complete benediction. But according to R. Johanan who requires the inclusion of the words "King of the universe," how can it be considered a complete benediction ? 

5 See fol. 11b, p. 70. 

6 The morning prayer opens "Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, Who formest light and createst darkness" (Singer, p. 37); the evening prayer "Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe... Thou rollest away the light from before the darkness" (ibid. p. 96). In either case his benediction refers to the Kingship and can apply to either "light" or "darkness," since both are mentioned. Therefore the objection raised on the score of R. Johanan's requirement is not valid. 

7 The instance of wine and beer. 

===========================================================

1 The instance quoted is parallel to that of wine and beer; and if the "general rule" includes the former, why not the latter? 

2 The benediction after eating bread contains "Since Thou nourishest and sustainest all beings... Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Who givest food unto all" (Singer, p. 280) ; this would appropriately apply also to dates. 

3 M. : Raba b. Hannina ; another variant is : Rabbah b. Hannina. See D. S. ad loc. 

4 Singer, pp. 42, 98. 

5 The morning prayer refers to God's lovingkindness, the evening prayer to His faithfulness in fulfilling His promises. 

6 The regulation is to bow four times : at the beginning and end of the first benediction (Singer, p. 44), "We give thanks unto Thee" (p. 51), "Blessed... Whose name is all-good" (p. 53). 

7 Therefore one should stand erect on mentioning His name. 

8 Therefore he should still be bent on mentioning His name. 

9 I.e. When the Name is mentioned, one should be bowed? 

10 With one sharp bend of the body, but he raised himself gradually and painfully.

3 In I Sam. xxviii. 6 it is stated, "The Lord answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets." Saul omitted to mention the Urim because the oracle was worked through the priests, and he had smitten their city (ibid. xxii. 19). This is evidence of shame for his crime. 

4 These words do not occur in the Bible text and are omitted in M. 

5 I.e. my division in Heaven — evidence of Saul's sins having been forgiven. 

6 These words were spoken by the Gibeonites who wished to vent their hatred on Saul's house ; they would accordingly not have referred to Saul as "the chosen of the Lord." The Rabbis therefore explain that these words were uttered by a Bat Kol; and if he was proclaimed "the chosen of the Lord," that is evidence that he had received forgiveness.
