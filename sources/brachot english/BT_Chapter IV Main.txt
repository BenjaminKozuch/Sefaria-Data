
CHAPTER IV 

MISHNAH I 

The morning Tefillah [may be said] until midday. R. Judah says: Until the fourth hour. The afternoon Tefillah [may be said] until the evening. R. Judah says : Until the middle of the afternoon. As far the Tefillah of the evening, it has no fixed time. The additional Tefillah [may be said] at any time in the day. R. Judah says : Until the seventh hour. 

GEMARA 

I quote against the Mishnah : The obligation [of the Shema'] is at sunrise, so as to unite the Ge'ullah and the Tefillah[1], and consequeutly one says the Tefillah in the day-time[2]! For whom is this teaching intended? For the Wetikin[3]; for R. Johanan said: The Wetikin used to finish it with the sunrise. As for the rest of the world, [they may say it] until midday. And not beyond that? For Rab Mari b. Rab Huna, the son of R. Jeremiah b. Abba, has said in the name of R. Johanan: If a man erred and omitted to say the Tefillah in the evening, he should say it twice in the morning; [if he omitted it] in the morning, he should say it twice in the afternoon. One can therefore say the prayer all day long ! Up to midday one receives the reward of having said the Tefillah in its due time; but beyond that, one receives the reward of having said the Tefillah, but not the reward of having said it in its due time. 

The question was asked : How is it if one erred and omitted the afternoon Tefillah — shall he say it twice in the evening ? If thou thinkest thou canst answer [by quoting] "If one erred and omitted the evening Tefillah, he should say it twice in the morning," [that is different] because it is one day ; as it is written, "And there was evening and there was morning one day " (Gen. i. 5)[4]. But here the Tefillah is the substitute for the sacrifice[1], and the day having passed, the sacrifice becomes void[2]. Or is it perhaps because Tefillah is supplication, and one may pray whenever he wishes? Come and hear: For Rab Huna b. Judah said in the name of R. Isaac, in the name of R. Johanan[3]: If one erred and omitted the afternoon Tefillah, he should say it twice in the evening, and the principle "The day having passed, the sacrifice becomes void" does not apply. It is quoted in objection, "That which is crooked cannot be made straight, and that which is wanting cannot be numbered" (Eccles. i. 15) — "that which is crooked cannot be made straight," i.e. one who has omitted the Shema' of the evening or morning, or the Tefillah of the evening or morning[4]; "and that which is wanting cannot be numbered," i.e. his companions were numbered for the purpose of a religious duty[5], and he was not numbered among them! R. Isaac said in the name of R. Johanan: With whom are we here dealing[6]? With one who intentionally omitted [the Shema' or Tefillah]. Rab Ashe said : There is confirmation in the fact that he used the term "omitted" and not "erred." Draw that conclusion[7]. 

Our Rabbis have taught : If one erred and omitted the afternoon [[fol. 26 b.]] Tefillah on the Sabbath-eve, he says the Tefillah twice on the night of the Sabbath. If one erred and omitted the afternoon Tefillah on the Sabbath, he says the week-day Tefillah twice at the conclusion of the Sabbath. In the first he adds the paragraph of "Division[8]," but not in the second[9]. If he added this paragraph in the second and not in the first, then the reading of the first Tefillah counts for him but not the second[10]. One might deduce from this teaching that since he did not add the paragraph of "Division" in the first Tefillah, he is as though he had not prayed at all and we make him repeat it. But against this I quote : If one erred and did not mention the reference to rain[1] in the benediction "Thou sustainest the living[2]" or the request for rain in the benediction of "the Years[3]," we make him repeat it ; but if he omitted the paragraph of "Division" in the benediction "Thou favourest man with knowledge," we do not make him repeat it, because he is able to say it over the cup [of wine][4]! The contradiction [remains unsolved]. 

It has been reported : R. Jose b. R. Hannina said : The Patriarchs instituted the Tefillot. R. Joshua b. Levi said: The Tefillot were instituted to correspond with the continual sacrifices. There is a teaching in agreement with both of them. There is a teaching in agreement with R. Jose b. R. Hannina: Abraham instituted the morning Tefillah; as it is said, "And Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he had stood" (Gen. xix. 27) — "standing" means prayer; as it is said, "Then stood up Phineas and prayed" (Ps. cvi. 30)[5]. Isaac instituted the afternoon Tefillah; as it is said, "And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at eventide" (Gen. xxiv. 63) — "meditation" [sihah] means prayer; as it is said, "A prayer of the afflicted when he fainteth, and poureth out his complaint [sihah] before the Lord" (Ps, cii. 1). Jacob instituted the evening Tefillah ; as it is said, "And he lighted [paga'] upon the place, and tarried there all night" (Gen. xxviii. 11) —  "alighting" means prayer; as it is said, "Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession [paga'] to Me" (Jer. vii. 16). There is also a teaching in agreement with R. Joshua b. Levi : Why is it declaimed: The morning Tefillah [may be said] until midday ? Because the morning continual offering could be brought until midday. R. Judah says : Until the fourth hour, because the morning continual offering could be brought until the fourth hour. And why is it declared : The afternoon Tefillah [may be said] until the evening? Because the twilight continual offering could be brought until the evening. B. Judah says : Until the middle of the afternoon, because the twilight continual offering could be brought until the middle of the afternoon. And why is it declared : As for the Tefillah of the evening, it has no fixed time? Because the limbs[6] and the fat[1] which had not been consumed by the evening may be offered at any time during the night. And why is it declared : The additional Tefillah [may be said] at any time in the day? Because the additional offering could be brought at any time during the day. R. Judah says : Until the seventh hour, because the additional offering could be brought until the seventh hour[2]. 

Which is "the greater afternoon"? The time from six and a half hours and onwards[3] And which is "the lesser afternoon"? The time from nine and a half hours and onwards[4]. 

The question was asked : Does R. Judah mean[5] the middle of the first afteraoon-tide or the middle of the latter afternoon-tide? Come and hear : For there is a teaching : R. Judah says : [The Sages] mean the middle of the latter afternoon-tide, and that is eleven hours less a quarter[6]. We might suppose that this is a refutation of R. Jose b. R. Hannina[7]! But he could reply : I certainly maintain that the Patriarchs instituted the Tefillot, but the Rabbis subsequently found a basis for them in the sacrifices. For if thou sayest not so[8], who instituted the additional Tefillah, according to R. Jose b. R. Hannina? But the Patriarchs instituted the Tefillot, and the Rabbis subsequently found a basis for them in the sacrifices. 

R. Judah says: Until the fourth hour. 

The question was asked: Is "until" inclusive, or is it perhaps exclusive[9]? Come and hear: R. Judah says: Until the middle of the afternoon. That is quite right if thou maintainest that this means "until" but not including — for that is the point of variance between R. Judah and the Rabbis[10]; but if thou maintainest that [[fol. 27 a.]] it means "until" and including, then R. Judah would be in agreement with the Rabbis ! What, then, does it signify? Until but not including. Let me, then, quote the sequel of the teaching: The additional Tefillah [may he said] at any time in the day. R. Judah says: Until the seventh hour. But there is a teaching: If there be before a man two Tefillot, one the additional and the other of the afternoon, he should say that of the afternoon and afterwards the additional ; because the former is constant, the latter not constant[1]. R. Judah says: He should first recite the additional Tefillah and afterwards that of the afternoon, because [the time of the former] lapses, but the other does not. That is quite right if thou maintainest that "until" means including, and thus the two Tefillot are found together; but if thou maintainest that "until" means excluding, how is it these two Tefillot are found together? For when the time of the afternoon Tefillah has arrived, the time of the additional Tefillah has passed[2]! What, then, does it signify? "Until" and including[3]. 

Then the difficulty in the first clause remains, viz. : What is the point of variance between R. Judah and the Rabbis[4]? Dost thou hold the opinion that when R. Judah mentioned "The middle of the afternoon" he meant the second half? He meant the first half, and he must be understood to say : When does the first half conclude and the latter half commence? At the expiration of the eleventh hour less a quarter[5]. Rab Nahman[6] said : We have also learnt so[7]. 

R. Judah b. Baba testified to five matters, viz. : We permit a woman to repudiate a marriage which has been contracted for her while she was a minor[8]; we permit a woman to remarry although there is only one witness[1] ; and concerning a cock which was stoned in Jerusalem for having killed a child[2]; and that wine forty days old was poured over the altar[3]; and concerning the morning continual offering that it was brought in the first four hours[4]. Conclude from this that "until" is inclusive ; yes, draw that conclusion. Rab Kahana said : The Halakah is in accord with R. Judah, since there is such a teaching in the Behirta[5]. 

"And concerning the morning continual offering that it was brought in the first four hours." Who is the authority for the following teaching : "And as the sun waxed hot, it melted" (Exod. xvi. 21) — this refers to the fourth hour of the day? Thou sayest "the fourth hour"; but perhaps it means the sixth hour ! When the Bible states "In the heat of the day" (Gen. xviii. 1) it means the sixth hour. How, then, am I to understand "As the sun waxed hot, it melted" ? That refers to the fourth hour[6]. In accordance with whose opinion is this? It can be neither R. Judah's nor the Rabbis'. If it were R. Judah's, up to [and including] the fourth hour is still morning[7] ; and if it were the Rabbis', up to midday is still morning ! If thou wilt I can say it is R. Judah's view or the Rabbis'. If thou wilt I can say it is the view of the Rabbis — because the Scriptures state, "Morning by morning" (Exod. l.c.), thus dividing the morning into two parts[8]. If thou wilt I can say it is R. Judah's view — because one word for "morning" is superfluous, the intention being to anticipate [the time for gathering] by one hour[1] Everybody agrees "As the sun waxed hot, it melted" means in the fourth hour. How is this proved? Rab Aha b. Jacob said: The Scriptures state, "As the sun waxed hot, it melted" — which is the hour when the sun is hot and the shade cool? Say it is the fourth hour. 

The afternoon Tefillah [may he said] until the evening. R. Judah aays: Until the middle of the afternoon. 

Rab Hisda asked Rab Isaac[2]: Rab Kahana stated above[3] that the Halakah is in accordance with R. Judah since there is such a teaching in the Behirta. How is it here[4]? He was silent and answered him not a word. Rab Hisda said : "We see from the fact that Rab recited the Sabbath-Tefillah on the Sabbath-eve while it was yet day, it is to be concluded that the Halakah is in agreement with R, Judah[5] ! On the contrary, from the fact that Rab Huna and the Rabbis did not say the [Sabbath]- Tefillah until it was night, conclude that the Halakah is not in agreement with R. Judah. Since it has not been reported whether the Halakah accords with either, he who acted in agreement with the one did rightly, and he who acted in agreement with the other did rightly. 

Rab went on a visit to the house of Geniba and said the Sabbath-Tefillah on the Sabbath-eve. R. Jeremiah b. Abba was praying behind Rab, and when the latter finished his Tefillah he did not interrupt the devotions of R. Jeremiah[6]. Draw three deductions from this : A man may say the Sabbath- Tefillah on the Sabbath-eve[7] ; a disciple may pray behind his master ; and it is forbidden to pass in front of those who are saying the Tefillah. [This last-mentioned] supports the teaching of R. Joshua b. Levi : It is forbidden to pass in front of those who are saying the Tefillah. But it is not so, seeing that R. Assi and R. Ammi did so pass ! It was beyond a distance of four cubits that R. Ammi and R. Assi passed. But how could R. Jeremiah act thus[8]? For lo, Rab Judah said in the name of Rab: A man should never pray in front of or [[fol. 27 b.]] behind his master ! And there is a teaching: R. Eliezer[1] says: He who prays behind his master[2], or greets his master or returns his salutation[3], or opposes [the opinions taught by] his master's school, or reports a teaching [in his master's name] which he had not heard from his master's lips, causes the Shekinah to depart from Israel ! It was different with R. Jeremiah b. Abba, because he was a disciple-colleague, and thus he asked Rab, "Hast thou made the 'division'[4]?" to which he replied, "Yes, I have done so"; and R. Jeremiah did not say, "Did the master make the 'division'?" But had he made the 'division'? For lo, R. Abin[5] said : On one occasion Rabbi said the Sabbath-Tefillah on the Sabbath-eve, and then entered the bath and came out and taught us our chapter ; and it was not yet dark ! Rab said : He must have gone into the bath-house only to perspire, and that happened before the decree was issued against it. That cannot be correct, because Abbai permitted Rab Dimai b. Liwai[6] to fumigate baskets[7]! That was a mistake. Can a mistake [of this nature] be rectified? For Abidan[8] said : On one occasion the heavens became thick with clouds, so that the people were led to believe that it was dusk. They entered the Synagogue and said the Tefillah for the conclusion of the Sabbath on the Sabbath. Afterwards the clouds dispersed and the sun shone forth ; so they came and put the question to Rabbi. His reply was that since they had said the Tefillah, it must stand. It is different with a Congregation, because we do not put them to trouble[9]. 

R. Hiyya b. Ashe[10] said: Rab said the Sabbath-Tefillah on the Sabbath-eve[11] ; R. Josiah said the Tefillah for the conclusion of the Sabbath on the Sabbath. "Rab said the Sabbath-Tefillah on the Sabbath-eve" — did he recite the "Sanctification[12]" over the cup of wine, or did he omit it? Come and hear : For Rab Nahman[13] said in the name of Samuel : A man may say the Sabbath-Tefillah on the Sabbath-eve and recite the "Sanctification" over the cup of wine; and the Halakah is in accord with his view. "R. Josiah said the Tefillah for the conclusion of the Sabbath on the Sabbath" did he recite the Habdalah over the cup of wine or did he omit it? Come and hear : For Rab Judah said in the name of Samuel : A man may say the Tefillah for the conclusion of the Sabbath on the Sabbath and recite the Habdalah over the cup of wine. R. Zera said in the name of R. Assi[1], in the name of R. Eleazar, in the name of R. Hannina, in the name of Rab[2] : At the side of this pillar, R. Ishmael b. R. Jose said the Sabbath-Tefillah on the Sabbath-eve. When 'Ulla came he said : It was at the side of this palm-tree, not pillar ; it was not R. Ishmael b. R. Jose, but R. Eleazar b. R. Jose ; and it was not the Sabbath-Tefillah on the Sabbath-eve, but the Tefillah for the conclusion of the Sabbath on the Sabbath. 

As for the Tefillah of the evening, it has no fixed time. 

What means it has no fixed time? If we are to suppose that should a man so desire, he can say the Tefillah at any time during the night, then let the Mishnah teach explicitly, "The evening Tefillah [may be said] at any time during the night"! What, then, means it has no fixed time? It is in accord with him who declared that the evening-Tefillah is voluntary; for Rab Judah said in the name of Samuel: As for the evemng-Tefillah, Rabban Gamaliel declares it to be obligatory, but R. Joshua declares it to be voluntary. Abbai said[3] : The Halakah is in agreement with him who declares it to be obligatory ; but Raba[4] said : The Halakah is in agreement with him who declares it to be voluntary. 

Our Rabbis have taught : It happened that a disciple came before R. Joshua and asked him, "Is the evening-Tefillah voluntary or obligatory?" He replied, "It is voluntary." Then he came before Rabban Gamaliel and asked him the same question. He replied, "It is obligatory." He thereupon said to him, "But has not R. Joshua told me it was voluntary!" Rabban Gamaliel said to him, "Wait until the shield-bearers[5] enter the House of Study." When the shield-bearers had assembled, the questioner stood up and asked, "Is the evening-Tefillah voluntary or obligatory ?" 

Rabban Gamaliel replied, "It is obligatory." Rabban Gamaliel said to the Sages, "Is there anyone who has a different opinion on this matter?" R. Joshua said to him, "No[1]" Then Rabban Gamaliel said to him, "But has it not been reported to me in thy name that it is voluntary ?" And he added, "Joshua, stand up that it may be testified against thee." R. Joshua stood up and said, "If I were living and he[2] dead, the living would be able to deny the statement of the dead ; but seeing that I am alive and he also is alive, how can the living deny the statement of the living ! " 

Then Rabban Gamaliel sat and commenced his discourse while R. Joshua remained standing[3], until all those present began to murmur and cried to Huspit the interpreter[4], "Stop !" and he stopped. They said, "How long is [Rabban Gamaliel] going to continue heaping indignities upon [R. Joshua]? Last year he slighted him on the question of the New Year[5] ; he slighted him on the question of the firstborn in the incident of R. Sadok[6]; and here again he has slighted him. Come, let us depose him[7]! Whom shall we appoint in his stead ? Shall we appoint R. Joshua ? [No ;] he is a party in the incident. Shall we appoint R. 'Akiba ? [No ;] perhaps Rabban Gamaliel will plague him because of his lack of ancestral merit[8]. Let us, then, appoint R. Eleazar b. 'Azariah, for he is wise, rich, and he is of the tenth generation from Ezra. He is wise, so if anyone[9] puts difficult questions to him, he will be able to reply to him ; and he is rich, so if it be necessary for someone to attend at the palace of the Emperor[10], he will be qualified to do so ; and he is of the tenth generation from Ezra, so he possesses ancestral merit and Rabban Gamaliel will not be able to worry him on that score." 

They attended upon R. Eleazar b. 'Azariah and asked him, "Would the master consent to become the head of the College?" He replied, "I will first go and take counsel with the members of my household." He went and consulted his wife, and she said to [[fol. 28a.]] him, "Perhaps they will soon depose thee!" He answered[1] "[Let a man] use the cup of honour[2] for one day, and to-morrow let it be broken." She said to him, "Thou hast no grey hair[3]!" That day he was eighteen[4] years of age; but a miracle was wrought for him, and eighteen rows of hair[5] turned grey. That is what R. Eleazar b. 'Azariah meant when he said, "Behold I am like one seventy years old," and not "I am seventy years old[6]." 

It has been taught : That same day, they removed the doorkeeper [of the College] and permission was granted to the disciples to enter ; for Rabban Gamaliel had issued a proclamation: "A disciple, who is not inwardly the same as outwardly[7], will not be allowed to enter the House of Study." That day many forms had to be added[8]. R. Johanan said : Abba Jose[9] b. Dostai and the Rabbis differ as to the number; one declaring four hundred forms were added, the other declaring it was seven hundred. This [vast addition] depressed Rabban Gamaliel who said, "Perhaps, God forbid, I have withheld Torah from Israel !" He was shown in a dream white pitchers full of ashes". It was not really so[11] ; but he was shown this to relieve his mind. 

It has been taught : That same day 'Eduyyot[1] was learnt, and wherever we find the phrase "on that day" it refers to that occasion. There was not a Halakah which had been left in a state of uncertainty in the House of Study which was not then made clear. Even Rabban Gamaliel did not absent himself from the House of Study[2]. For there is a Mishnaic teaching: On that day an Ammonite proselyte, named Judah, came before them in the House of Study and said to them, "May I enter the Community [of Israel]?" Rabban Gamaliel replied to him, "Thou art forbidden to enter the Community." R. Joshua said to him, "Thou art permitted to enter the Community." Rabban Gamaliel asked R. Joshua, "But has it not been said, 'An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the assembly of the Lord '?" (Deut. xxiii. 4). R. Joshua answered him, "Do, then, the Ammonites and Moabites still inherit their lands? Did not Sennacherib, king of Assyria, long ago come up and confuse all the nationalities ? As it is said, 'I have removed the bounds of the peoples, and have robbed their treasures, and have brought down as one mighty the inhabitants' (Is. X. 13) ; and whoever issues [from a mixed body] issues from the majority[3]." Rabban Gamaliel said to him, "But has it not been said, 'Afterward I will bring back the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith the Lord' (Jer. xlix. 6) ? and therefore they have returned !" R. Joshua retorted, "And has it not been said, 'I will turn the captivity of My people Israel' (Amos ix. 14)? but they have not yet returned !" They immediately permitted him to enter the Community. 

Rabban Gamaliel thereupon said, "Since it is so, I will go and conciliate R. Joshua[4]." When he arrived at the latter's house, he noticed that the walls of his house were blackened, and said to him, "From the walls of thy house it can be recognised that thou art a charcoal-burner[5]." R. Joshua replied, "Woe to the generation whose leader thou art, for thou knowest not the struggle of the disciples to support and feed themselves!" He said to him, "I beg thy pardon[1]; forgive me." He took no notice of him. "Do it out of regard for my father!" He made peace with him. 

They said, "Who will go and tell the Rabbis [that we are reconciled]? " A fuller[2] said to them, "I will go," R. Joshua sent [the following message] to the House of Study, "Let him who has been accustomed to wear the mantle [of honour] still wear it ; and shall he who has not been accustomed to wear the mantle say to him who has been accustomed to wear it, 'Take off thy mantle and I shall put it on'[3]?" R. 'Akiba said to the Rabbis, "Bolt the doors, so that the slaves of Rabban Gamaliel may not enter and injure the Rabbis[4]." R. Joshua said, "It is better that I should rise and go myself to him[5]." He went and knocked at his door, and said to him, "Let the sprinkler[6] who is the son of a sprinkler sprinkle; for shall one who is not a sprinkler nor the son of a sprinkler say to a sprinkler who is the son of a sprinkler, 'Thy water is cave water and thy ashes the ashes of a stove'[7]?" R. 'Akiba said to him, "R. Joshua, thou hast become reconciled ! Have we not done this only out of regard for thine honour? To-morrow thou and I will go early to the door of [Rabban Gamaliel's] house[8]." They asked, "What shall we do? Shall we depose [R. Eleazar b. 'Azariah] ? We have the tradition, 'We may raise to a higher degree of sanctity but not degrade to a lower degree! ' If we ask one of them to give the discourse on one Sabbath and the other on the next Sabbath, it will lead to jealousy. Let, then, Rabban Gamaliel give the discourse three Sabbaths [in the month] and R. Eleazar b. 'Azariah one Sabbath," That is what the teacher meant who asked, "Whose Sabbath was it? It was R. Eleazar b. 'Azariah's[1]" And the disciple was R. Simeon b. Johai[2]. 

The additional Tefillah [may he said] at any time in the day. R. Judah says: Until the seventh hour. 

R. Johanan said : If one reads it after the seventh hour, he is called a transgressor. 

Our Rabbis have taught[3]: If there be before a man two Tefillot, one of the afternoon and the other the additional, he should say that of the afternoon and afterwards the additional, because the former is constant, the latter not constant[4]. R. Judah says : He should first recite the additional Tefillah and afterwards that of the afternoon, because the former is a duty that lapses, but the other is not. R. Johanan said : The Halakah is — one first says the afternoon Tefillah and then the additional. 

When R. Zera[5] was weary of study, he used to go and sit at the entrance of the school of R. Nathan b. Tobi saying, "When the Rabbis pass by, I will stand up before them and receive the reward[6]" He once went out ; and when R. Nathan b. Tobi came he asked him[7], "Who is stating the Halakah in the House of Study?" He replied, "Thus spake R. Johanan : The Halakah is not according to R. Judah who said, 'He should first recite the additional Tefillah and afterwards that of the afternoon'." R. Zera asked him, "Did R. Johanan say that?" He replied, "Yes, it was taught us by him forty times." He asked him, "Is this the only one [he expounded] to thee, or was it new to thee[8]?" He replied, "It was new to me, because I was in doubt [whether it was not a teaching] of R. Joshua b. Levi." 

R. Joshua b. Levi said : Whoever prays the additional Tefillah after the seventh hour, as taught by R. Judah, of him the Scriptures state, "Those who are smitten [nuge][9] because of the advocated appointed seasons will I gather, who are of thee" (Zeph. iii. 18). How is it known that nuge is a term of "breaking" ? As Rab Joseph translated : "A breach has come upon the enemies of the house of Israel[1] because they delayed the times of the festivals in Jerusalem." R. Eleazar said : Whoever says the morning Tefillah after the fourth hour, of him the Scriptures declare, "Those who are troubled [nuge] because of the appointed seasons will I gather, who are of thee." How is it known that nuge is a term for "trouble" ? For it is written, "My soul melteth away from heaviness [tugah]" (Ps. cxix. 28). Rab Nahman b. Isaac said : From the following : "Her virgins are afflicted [nugot], and she herself is in bitterness" (Lam. i. 4). 

[[fol. 28 b.]] Rab Iwya was ill and did not attend Rab Joseph's discourse[2]. The next day when he arrived, Abbai wished to set Rab Joseph's mind at rest[3] ; so he said to him, "For what reason did not the master attend the discourse?" He replied, "My heart was faint and I could not." He asked him, "Why didst thou not eat something and come?" He answered, "Does not the master agree with the opinion of Rab Huna who said : It is forbidden a man to eat anything before praying the additional Tefillah?" He replied, "Then the master should have said the additional Tefillah by himself and eaten something and attended." He said to him, "Does not the master agree with the opinion of R. Johanan who declared : A man is forbidden to anticipate the congregational Tefillah by praying alone?" He replied, "But has it not been reported in this connection : R. Abba[4] said : This teaching applies only when he is with the Congregation[5]?" The Halakah is in accord neither with Rab Huna nor R. Joshua b. Levi. [It is not] in accord with Rab Huna, as is here mentioned. [Nor is it] in accord with R. Joshua b. Levi who said : When the time of the afternoon Tefillah has arrived, it is forbidden to eat anything before praying the afternoon Tefillah. 

MISHNAH II 

B. Nehunya h. Hakkanah, on entering and leaving the House of Study, used to offer a short prayer. They said to him : What is the nature of this prayer ? He replied : On entering I pray that no offence should occur through me; and when I leave I offer thanks-giving for my portion[1]. 

GEMARA 

Our Rabbis have taught : What used he to say on entering ? "May it be Thy will, O Lord my God, that no offence occur through me ; that I stumble not in the matter of Halakah ; that my colleagues have occasion to rejoice in me ; that I pronounce not anything clean that is unclean, or unclean that is clean; that my colleagues stumble not through me in the matter of Halakah ; and that I may have occasion to rejoice in them." What used he to say on leaving? "I give thanks before Thee, O Lord my God, that Thou hast set my portion with those who sit in the House of Study and not with those who sit at street-corners[2]; for I and they rise early — I to words of Torah, but they to vain matters ; I and they labour, but I labour and receive a reward whereas they labour and receive no reward ; I and they hasten — I to the life of the world to come, but they to the pit of destruction." 

Our Rabbis have taught : When R. Eliezer was ill, his disciples went in to visit him. They said to him, "Master, teach us the ways of life whereby we may be worthy of the life of the world to come." He said to them, "Be careful of the honour of your colleagues ; restrain your children from recitation[3], and seat them between the knees of the disciples of the wise ; and when you pray, know before Whom ye stand ; and on that account will you be worthy of the life of the world to come." 

When Rabban Johanan b. Zakkai was ill, his disciples went in to visit him. On beholding them, he began to weep. His disciples said to him, "O lamp of Israel, right-hand pillar[1], mighty hammer! Wherefore dost thou weep ?" He replied to them, "If I was being led into the presence of a human king who to-day is here and tomorrow in the grave, who if he were wrathful against me his anger would not be eternal, who if he imprisoned me the imprisonment would not be everlasting, who if he condemned me to death the death would not be for ever, and whom I can appease with words and bribe with money — even then I would weep ; but now, when I am being led into the presence of the King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He, Who lives and endures for all eternity, Who if He be wrathful against me His anger is eternal. Who if He imprisoned me the imprisonment would be everlasting. Who if He condemned me to death the death would be for ever, and Whom I cannot appease with words nor bribe with money — nay more, when before me lie two ways, one of the Garden of Eden and the other of Gehinnom, and I know not in which I am to be led — shall I not weep ?" They said to him, "Our master, bless us !" He said to them, "May it be His will that the fear of Heaven be upon you [as great] as the fear of flesh and blood," His disciples exclaimed, "Only as great !" He replied, "Would that it be [as great] ; for know ye, when a man intends to commit a transgression, he says, 'I hope nobody will see me'[2]." At the time of his departure [from the world] he said to them, "Remove all the utensils because of the defilement[3] and prepare a seat for Hezekiah, king of Judah, who is coming[4]." 

MISHNAH III — VI 

III. Rabban Gamaliel says: Every day one should pray the eighteen [benedictions][5]. R. Joshua says : The abstract of the eighteen [benedictions][6]. R. 'Akiba says: If his prayer is fluent in his mouth, he should pray the eighteen ; but if not, an abstract of the eighteen. 

IV. R. Eliezer says : If one makes his prayer a fixed task, his prayer is not a supplication. R. Joshua says : If one is journeying in a place of danger, he should offer a short prayer, saying : "Save, O Lord, Thy people, the remnant of Israel ; in all times of crisis may their needs be before Thee. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Who hearkenest to prayer." 

V. If he is riding upon an ass, he should alight and say the Tefillah ; but if he is unable to alight, he should turn his face [in the direction of Jerusalem] If he is unable to turn his face, he should direct his heart towards the Holy of Holies. 

VI. If he is journeying in a ship or on a raft, he should direct his heart towards the Holy of Holies. 

GEMARA 

To what do these eighteen benedictions correspond ? R. Hillel, the son of R. Samuel b. Nahmani, said : They correspond to the eighteen times the Divine Name [JHWH] is mentioned by David  in the Psalm "Ascribe unto the Lord, O ye sons of might" (Ps.xxix). Rab Joseph said : They correspond to the eighteen times the Divine Name[1] is mentioned in the Shema'. R. Tanhum said in the name of R. Joshua b. Levi : They correspond to the eighteen vertebrae in the spinal column. 

R. Tanhum also said in the name of R. Joshua b. Levi : When one says the Tefillah, he must bow[2] until all the vertebrae in the spine are loosened. 'Ulla said : [He must bow] until he sees a ring [of flesh formed] opposite his heart. R. Hannina said : If he lowered his head, more than that is unnecessary. Raba said : That is so, if it gives him pain [to bow low] and he appears like one making obeisance. 

As to those eighteen benedictions — there are nineteen ! R. Levi said : The benediction relating to the Minim[3] was subsequently instituted at Jabneh[4]. Corresponding to what was it instituted? 

R. Levi said : According to R. Hillel, the son of R. Samuel b. Nahmani[1], it corresponds to "The God [el] of glory thundereth" (Ps. xxix. 3) ; according to Rab Joseph, it corresponds to "One" in the Shema' ; according to R. Tanhum in the name of R. Joshua b. Levi, it corresponds to the small vertebra in the spinal column. 

Our Rabbis have taught : Simeon the Cotton-dealer[3] arranged the eighteen benedictions in order in the presence of Rabban Gamaliel at Jabneh. Rabban Gamaliel asked the Sages, "Is there anyone who knows how to word the benediction relating to the Minim?" Samuel the Small stood up and worded it. In the [[fol. 29a.]] following year he had forgotten it[4], and reflected for two or three hours[5] ; but they did not discharge him[6]. Why did they not discharge him ? For lo, Rab Judah said in the name of Rab : If [the Precentor] errs in all the [eighteen] benedictions we do not discharge him ; but [if he errs] in the benediction relating to the Minim we do discharge him, for fear that he is a Min ! It was different with Samuel the Small, because he had himself worded it. But there may be a fear that perhaps he had apostatized ! Abbai said : We have a tradition that a good man does not become bad. He does not ? Behold it is written, "But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness and committeth iniquity" (Ezek. xviii. 24)! That refers to a man who was originally wicked[7]; but the man who is originally righteous does not. He does not ? Behold there is a Mishnaic teaching : "Trust not in thyself until the day of thy death[8]" ; and Johanan the High Priest held the Office of High Priest for eighty years and eventually became a Sadducee ! Abbai said : Johanan is the same person as Januaeus[9]. Raba said : They are different persons ; and Jannaeus was originally wicked, but Johanan originally righteous. That is quite right according to Abbai[1] ; but it is in contradiction with Raba's view[2]. Raba can reply that even with one who was originally righteous there is the possibility of his apostatizing. If so, why did they not discharge [Samuel the Small]? It was different with him, because he had already commenced it[3]. For Rab Judah in the name of Rab (another version : R. Joshua b. Levi) said : This teaching[4] applies only to one who has not commenced it ; but if he had commenced it, he may finish it. 

To what do the seven Sabbath-benedictions[5] correspond ? R. Halafta b. Saul said: To the seven "voices" which David mentioned concerning the waters (Ps. xxix.). To what do the nine benedictions in the New Year Tefillah[6] correspond ? R. Isaac[7] of Kartignin[8] said : To the nine references to the Divine Name which Hannah made in her prayer (I Sam. ii. 1-10) ; for the teacher said : On the New Year's day Sarah, Rachel and Hannah were "visited." To what do the twenty-four benedictions of the fast day[9] correspond ? R. Helbo said: To the twenty-four "cries[10]" Solomon mentioned when he brought the Ark into the house of the Holy of Holies (I Kings viii.). In that case, one should say them every day[11]! [No ;] when did Solomon say them ? On a day of supplication ; and so we likewise say them on a day of supplication. 

R. Joshua says : The abstract of the eighteen [benedictions]. 

What is the abstract of the eighteen ? Rab said : An abstract of each benediction. Samuel said [1] : "Give us understanding, O Lord, our God, to know Thy ways ; circumcise our hearts to fear Thee, and forgive us so that we may be redeemed. Keep us far from our pains ; satiate us on the pastures of Thy land and gather our scattered ones from the four [corners of the earth]. Let them that go astray be judged according to Thy will, and wave Thy hand over the wicked. Let the righteous rejoice in the rebuilding of Thy city and in the establishment of Thy Temple, and in the flourishing of the horn of David Thy servant, and in the clear-shining light of the son of Jesse, Thine anointed. Even before we call, do Thou answer. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Who hearkenest unto prayer." 

Abbai cursed him who says the prayer "Give us understanding[2]." Rab Nahman said in the name of Samuel : During the whole of the year, one may say the prayer "Give us understanding" except at the conclusion of the Sabbath and Festivals, because then it is necessary to say the "Division" in the benediction "Thou favourest man with knowledge[3]." Rabbah b. Samuel[4] objected : Let him, then, say the fourth benediction separately[5] ! Have we not the Mishnaic teaching : R. 'Akiba says : One may say the fourth benediction by itself ; R. Eliezer says : [One can say the "Division"] in the benediction of thanksgiving[6]? But do we act the whole of the year in accordance with R. 'Akiba's view that we should do so now [at the conclusion of the Sabbath and Festivals] ? On what ground do we not follow R. 'Akiba's view during the whole year ? Because eighteen benedictions were instituted, not nineteen ; and so here also, seven were instituted, not eight[7]. Mar Zotra objected : Let it be included in brief in the [shortened] Tefillah, thus: "Give us understanding, Thou Who dividest between holy and profane" ! The question [remained unanswered]. 

Rab Bebai b. Abbai said : The whole of the year one may say the prayer "Give us understanding" except during the rainy season[1], because it is necessary to add the request [for rain] in the benediction of "the Years." Mar Zotra objected : Let it be included in brief in the [shortened] prayer thus : "Satiate us on the pastures of Thy land, and give dew and rain" ! It would lead to confusion. If so, the inclusion of the "Division" in the benediction "Thou favourest man with knowledge" should likewise lead to confusion ! They answered : In this latter case, since it comes at the beginning of the prayer, it would not cause confusion ; but in the former, since it occurs in the middle of the prayer, it would. Rab Ashe objected : Let him say it in the benediction "Who hearkenest unto prayer[2]" ; for R. Tanhum declared in the name of R. Assi : If a man erred and omitted the reference to rain in the benediction of "the Revival of the Dead[3]," we make him repeat it ; [if he omitted] the request [for rain] in the benediction of "the Years," we do not make him repeat it, because he can include it in "Who hearkenest unto prayer" ; but [if he omitted] the "Division" in "Thou favourest man with knowledge," we do not make him repeat it, because he is able to say it over the cup of wine[4] ! It is different with one who erred. 

It was mentioned above : "R. Tanhum declared in the name of R. Assi : If a man erred and omitted the reference to rain in the benediction of 'the Revival of the Dead,' we make him repeat it; [if he omitted] the request [for rain] in the benediction of 'the Years,' we do not make him repeat it, because he can include it in 'Who hearkenest unto prayer' ; but [if he omitted] the 'Division' in 'Thou favourest man with knowledge,' we do not make him repeat it, because he is able to say it over the cup of wine!" Against this is quoted : If one erred and omitted the reference to rain in the benediction of "the Revival of the Dead," we make him repeat it ; [if he omitted] the request [for rain] in the benediction of "the Years," we make him repeat it; but [if he omitted] the "Division" in "Thou favourest man with knowledge," we do not make him repeat it, because he is able to say it over the cup of wine ! There is no contradiction, the latter referring to one praying alone, the former to one praying with a Congregation. Why should he not repeat it if praying with a Congregation? Because he can hear it from the Precentor[5]. If so [the reason stated above] "because he can include it in 'Who hearkenest unto prayer'" should rather be, because he can hear it from the Precentor ! Nay, both the teachings refer to one praying alone and there is no contradiction ; the statement [of R. Tanhum] refers to one who reminds himself [that he had omitted the prayer for rain] before reaching the benediction "Who hearkenest unto [[fol. 29b.]] prayer[1]," whereas the statement [of the Baraita] refers to one who reminds himself [of the omission] after having said the benediction "Who hearkenest unto prayer." 

R. Tanhum said in the name of R. Assi[2], in the name of R. Joshua b. Levi : If a man erred and omitted the reference to the New Moon in the sixteenth benediction[3], he must repeat it. If he reminded himself thereof in the seventeenth benediction, he goes back to the sixteenth ; if in the eighteenth, he goes back to the sixteenth. If he had concluded the Tefillah, he must recommence it. Rab Pappa the son of Rab Aha b. Adda said : The statement "If he had concluded the Tefillah, he must recommence it" only applies should he have moved his feet[4] ; but if he has not done so, he returns to the sixteenth benediction. He was asked : Whence hast thou obtained this teaching? He replied: From my father my teacher have I heard it, and he from Rab[5]. Rab Nahman b. Isaac said : The statement that if he had moved his feet he must recommence the Tefillah applies only to one who is not accustomed to offer personal supplications at its conclusion[6] ; but if that be his practice, he returns to the sixteenth benediction. Another version is : Rab Nahman b. Isaac said : The statement that if he had not moved his feet, he returns to the sixteenth benediction applies only to one who is accustomed to offer personal supplication at the conclusion of the Tefillah ; but if that be not his practice, he goes back to its commencement. 

IV. R. Eliezer says : If one makes his prayer a fixed task [keba'], his prayer is not supplication. 

What means keba'? R. Jacob b. Iddi said in the name of R. Osha'ya : Anyone whose prayer seems to him a burden. The Rabbis say : Anyone who does not recite it in language of supplication[7]. Rabbah and Rab Joseph both said : Anyone who is not able to add something new thereto[1]. R. Zera said : I am able to add something new, but I am afraid that I may become confused. Abbai b. Abin and R. Hannina b. Abin both said : [His prayer is keba'] who does not pray at dawn and sunset[2] ; for R. Hiyya b. Abba said in the name of R. Johanan : It is a religious duty to pray at dawn and sunset. R. Zera said : What Scriptural authority is there for this? "They shall fear Thee with the sun and before the moon[3] throughout all generations" (Ps. Ixxii. 5). In the West[4], they cursed anyone who prayed at those times. Why? Perhaps the time will be unsuitable for him[5]. 

R. Joshua says : If one is journeying in a place of danger, he should offer a short prayer, saying : "Save, O Lord, Thy people, the remnant of Israel ; in all times of crisis may their needs be before Thee." 

What means "times of crisis ['ibbur]"? Rab Hisda said in the name of Mar 'Ukba : Even at the time when Thou art full of wrath ['ebrah] against them like a woman big with child ['ubberet], may all their needs be before Thee. Another version is : Rab Hisda said in the name of Mar 'Ukba : Even at the time when they transgress ['oberim] the words of Torah, may all their needs be before Thee. 

Our Rabbis have taught : He who journeys in a place of herds of wild beasts or bands of robbers should offer a short prayer. Which is the short prayer ? R. Eliezer said : "Do Thy will in Heaven above ; grant tranquillity of spirit to those who fear Thee below, and do that which is good in Thy sight. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Who hearkenest unto prayer." R. Joshua said : "Hear the lament of Thy people Israel, and speedily fulfil their request. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Who hearkenest unto prayer." R. Eleazar b. Sadok said : "Hear the cry of Thy people Israel, and speedily fulfil their request. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Who hearkenest unto prayer." Others say : "The needs of Thy people Israel are many but their mind short[6]. May it be Thy will, O Lord our God, to grant each one sufficient for his maintenance, and to every person enough for his want. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Who hearkenest unto prayer." Rab Huna said : The Halakah is in accord with the "others." 

Elijah[1] said to Rab Judah, the brother of Rab Sala Hasida : "Be not wrathful and thou wilt not sin. Be not intoxicated and thou wilt not sin. When thou settest out on a journey, take counsel with thy Creator and go forth." What means, "Take counsel with thy Creator and go forth" ? R. Jacob said in the name of Rab Hisda : This refers to the prayer to be offered on undertaking a journey. 

R. Jacob also said in the name of Rab Hisda : Whoever sets out on a journey should offer the prayer ordained for a journey. What is this prayer? "May it be Thy will, O Lord my God, to conduct me in peace, to direct my steps in peace, to uphold me in peace, and to deliver me from every enemy and ambush by the way. Send a blessing upon the work of my hands, and let me obtain grace, lovingkindness and mercy in Thine eyes and in the eyes of all who behold me. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Who hearkenest unto prayer[2]." 

[[fol. 30 a.]] Abbai said : Always should a man associate himself with the Community[3]. How should he pray ? "May it be Thy will, O Lord our God, to conduct us in peace" etc. When should he ofter this prayer ? R. Jacob said in the name of Rab Hisda : From the time he sets forth on his journey. And how long[4]? R. Jacob said in the name of Rab Hisda: The distance of a Parsah. And how should he offer it ? Rab Hisda said : Standing ; Rab Sheshet said : Even while journeying. Rab Hisda and Rab Sheshet were once on a journey together. Rab Hisda stood up and offered the prayer. Rab Sheshet[5] said to his attendant, "What is Rab Hisda doing?" He replied, "He is standing and praying." He said to him, "Raise also me up and I too will pray ; for if thou canst be good, do not allow thyself to be called evil[6]." 

"What is the difference between "Give us understanding[1]" and the short prayer[2]? "Give us understanding" requires three benedictions before and three after it[3], and when he reaches his house, he need not again say the Tefillah ; whereas with the short prayer there is no necessity to utter the three benedictions before and after, but when he reaches his house, he must say the Tefillah. The Halakah is also that "Give us understanding" must be said standing, but the short prayer can be said either standing or journeying. 

V. If he is riding upon an ass, he should alight and say the Tefillah.

Our Rabbis have taught : If a man is riding upon an ass and the time of the Tefillah arrives, should he have somebody to hold his ass, he must alight and pray ; but if not, he sits in his place and prays. Rabbi says : In either case, he should sit in his place and pray, because his mind is unsettled. Raba[4] (another version : R. Joshua b. Levi) said : The Halakah is in agreement with Rabbi.  

Our Rabbis have taught : A blind man or one who is unable to locate the directions should direct his heart to his Father in Heaven ; as it is said, "And they pray unto the Lord" (I Kings viii. 44). If he is standing outside the [Holy] Land, he must direct his heart towards the land of Israel ; as it is said, "And pray unto Thee toward their land" (ibid. v. 48). If he is standing in the land of Israel, he must direct his heart towards Jerusalem ; as it is said, "And they pray unto the Lord toward the city which Thou hast chosen" (ibid. v. 44). If he is standing in Jerusalem, he must direct his heart towards the Temple ; as it is said, "And pray toward this house" (II Chron. vi. 32). If he is standing in the Temple, he must direct his heart towards the Holy of Holies; as it is said, "And they pray toward this place" (I Kings viii. 35). If he is standing in the Holy of Holies, he must direct his heart towards the mercy-seat[5]. If he is standing behind the mercy-seat, he must imagine himself to be in front of it. Consequently if he is standing in the East, he must turn West ; if in the West, he must turn East ; if in the South, he must turn North ; if in the North, he must turn South. As a result, all Israel will be directing their heart to one spot. R. Abin (another version : R. Abina) said : What Scriptural authority is there for this ? "Thy neck is like the tower of David, builded with turrets [talpiyyot] (Cant, iv. 4), i.e. a heap [tel] for all mouths [piyyot][1]. 

Samuel's father and Levi, when they wished to set out on a journey, used to rise up early[2] and say the Tefillah; and when the time arrived for reading the Shema' they read it then[3]. In accord with whose opinion is this ? That of the Tanna of the teaching : If one rises early to set out on a journey, they may bring him a Shofar[4] which he blows, a Lulab which he shakes, a Megillah in which he reads ; and when the time arrives for reading the Shema' he reads it. If he rose early to sit in a travelling coach or ship, he may say the Tefillah, and when the time arrives for reading the Shema' he reads it. R. Simeon b. Eleazar says : In all circumstances, he reads the Shema' and then says the Tefillah in order to unite it with the Ge'ullah. In what do they differ ? The former holds that to say the Tefillah standing is of greater importance[5]; the latter holds that to unite the Ge'ullah with the Tefillah is of greater importance. 

Maremar and Mar Zotra used to gather in their house ten men[6] on the Sabbath preceding a Festival[7], say the prayers and then go to the study-session. Rab Ashe used to say the prayers in the presence of the assembly alone and sitting[8], and when he returned to his house, he again said the Tefillah standing. The Rabbis said to him, "The master should act like Maremar and Mar Zotra[9]." He replied, "It is too much trouble for me." "Then let the master act like Samuel's father and Levi[10]." He replied, "We have not seen the Rabbis who are older than we acting in this manner." 

MISHNAH VII 

R. Eleazar b. 'Azariah says : The additional Tefillah is only to be said with the local Congregation. The Sages say: Whether with or without the local Congregation. R. Judah says in his name[1]: In any place where there is a local Congregation, the individual is exempt from the additional Tefillah[2]. 

GEMARA 

R. Judah is identical with the first Tanna's view ! There is a difference between them, viz. : an individual who lives in a place where there is no local Congregation[3]. The first Tanna holds that he is exempt [from the additional Tefillah], but R. Judah holds that he is under the obligation. Rab Huna b. Hinnana[4] said in the name of Rab Hiyya b. Rab[5] : The Halakah is in agreement with R. Judah as stated in the name of R. Eleazar b. 'Azariah. Rab Hiyya b. Abin said to him : Thou hast said well ; for Samuel has declared : Never have I said the additional Tefillah alone in [[fol. 30b.]] Nehardea[6] except on the day when the king's army came to the town[7], and the Rabbis were so troubled that they did not say the Tefillah, and I said it alone, because I was like an individual without a local Congregation. 

R. Hannina the Bible-teacher sat before R. Jannai ; as he sat he said, "The Halakah is in agreement with R. Judah as stated in the name of R. Eleazar b. 'Azariah." He said to him, "Go out and read thy Bible verses in the street[8], for the Halakah is not in agreement with R. Judah as stated in the name of R. Eleazar b. 'Azariah." R. Johanan said, "I noticed that R. Jannai said the Tefillah and then said another Tefillah[9]." R. Jeremiah said to R. Zera, "Perhaps he did not at first direct his heart [to his prayer] and finally did so[1]!" He replied, "See how great a man testifies concerning him[2]." 

Although there were thirteen Synagogues in Tiberias[3], R. Ammi and R. Assi never said the Tefillah except between the pillars where they studied[4]. 

It has been reported : Rab Isaac b. Abdemi said in the name of our teacher[5] : The Halakah is in agreement with R. Judah as stated in the name of R. Eleazar b. 'Azariah. R. Hiyya b. Abba said the Tefillah[6] and then said another. R. Zera asked him, "Why did the master act so? Is it because the master did not direct his heart [with the first] ? But R. Eleazar has said : A man should always examine himself; if he can direct his heart, then let him pray, but if not, he should not pray ! Or is it because the master did not include the reference to the New Moon [in the first Tefillah][7]? But there is a teaching: If a man erred and omitted the reference to the New Moon in the evening Tefillah, we do not require him to repeat it, because he can say it in the morning Tefillah; [if he omitted it] in the morning, we do not require him to repeat it, because he can say it in the additional Tefillah ; [if he omitted it] in the additional Tefillah, we do not require him to repeat it, because he can say it in the afternoon ! " He replied, "Has it not been reported in this connection : R. Johanan declared that this teaching applies only to a Congregation[8]?" 

How long must one wait between Tefillah and Tefillah[9]? Rab Huna and Rab Hisda [differ]. One said : Until his mind can offer supplication ; the other said : Until his mind can offer beseeching prayer. He who says : Until his mind can offer supplication [tithonen], it is because it is said, "And I supplicated [waethannan] the Lord" (Deut. iii. 23) ; and he who says : Until his mind can offer beseeching prayer [titholel], it is because it is written, "And Moses besought [wayyehal] the Lord" (Exod. xxxii. 11). 

Rab 'Anan said in the name of Rab : If a man erred and omitted the reference to the New Moon in the evening Tefillah, we do not require him to repeat it, because the Bet Din only consecrate the new month in the day-time. Amemar said : It is probable that Rab's statement applies to a full month[1] ; but in the case of a detective month, we require him to repeat it. Rab Ashe said to Amemar : Since Rab has stated a reason[2], what has it to do whether the month is full or defective ! Certainly there is no difference. 

May we return unto thee : The morning Tefillah !
