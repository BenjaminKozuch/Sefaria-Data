
CHAPTER VIII 
MISHNAH I — VIII 

I. The following are the points of variance between Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel in connection with the meal[1]. Bet Shammai say : [On a Sabbath or Festival] one pronunces the benediction over the day and then over the wine ; but Bet Hillel say : He pronounces the benediction over the wine and afterwards over the day. 

II. Bet Shammai say : We wash the hands and then fill[2] the cup ; but Bet Hillel say: We fill the cup and then wash the hands. 

III. Bet Shammai say : One wipes his hands with a napkin which he lays upon the table ; but Bet Hillel say : [He lays it] upon the bolster [of his couch]. 

IV. Bet Shammai say: [After the meal] they clear up[3] and then we wash the hands [prior to Grace] ; but Bet Hillel say : We wash the hands and then they clear up. 

V. Bet Shammai say : [The order of benedictions is[4]] light, food, spices and Habdalah[5]; but Bet Hillel say : Light, spices, food and Habdalah. Bet Shammai say : The wording[6] is "...Who created the light of fire" ; but Bet Hillel say : It is "...Who createst the lights of the fire." 

VI. We may not say the benediction over the light or spices of gentiles, over the light or spices of the dead[7], nor over the light or spices of idolatry. Nor do we say the benediction over the light until one can make use of its illumination. 

VII. If one ate and forgot to say Grace, Bet Shammai declare he should return to his place and say it ; but Bet Hillel declare he may say it wherever [the omission] is remembered by him. And what length of time may elapse in which he can say Grace? A Sufficient time for the food in the stomach to be digested. 

VIII. If wine is brought to them after the food and there is [only sufficient for] one cup, Bet Shammai declare he says the benediction over the wine and then over the food ; but Bet Hillel declare he says the benediction over the food and then over the wine. One may make the response "Amen" after an Israelite who pronounces a benediction[1], but not after a Samaritan who pronounces a benediction until he has heard the whole of the benediction. 

GEMARA . 
Our Rabbis have taught : The points of variance between Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel in connection with the meal are : Bet Shammai say : [On a Sabbath or Festival] one pronounces the benediction over the day and then over the wine, because the day causes the wine to be brought[2] and because he has already hallowed the day[3] before the wine was brought. But Bet Hillel say : One pronounces the benediction over the wine and then over the day, because the wine causes the Sanctification to be said[4]. Another reason is : The benediction over the wine is constant but that over the day is not constant, and when we have that which is constant and not constant, the former takes precedence[5]. The Halakah is in agreement with Bet Hillel. Why is this other reason necessary ? Shouldest thou say that there [Bet Shammai offer] two reasons but here [Bet Hillel offer] only one, therefore here also we have two reasons. "The benediction over the wine is constant but that over the day is not constant, and when we have that which is constant and not constant, the former takes precedence. The Halakah is in agreement with Bet Hillel." All this is obvious, for a Bat Kol had issued forth[6]! If thou wilt I can say [that this controversy] preceded the Bat Kol[7] ; or if thou wilt I can say it [[fol. 52 a.]] followed after the Bat Kol, but R. Joshua it was who said : We pay no attention to a Bat Kol[8]. 

Do Bet Shammai, however, hold that the benediction over the day is of greater importance[1]? Lo, there is a teaching: On entering his house at the conclusion of the Sabbath, he says the benediction over the wine, the light and the spices and after that says the Habdalah ; and should he have only one cup [of wine], he leaves it until after the meal and combines all [the benedictions] afterwards[2]. But how is it shown that this teaching emanates from Bet Shammai ; perhaps it is from Bet Hillel ? That cannot enter thy mind ; because it states "light and afterwards spices," and from whom hast thou heard that opinion? Bet Shammai; for there is a teaching : R. Judah said : Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel do not differ that the benediction over food comes first and Habdalah afterwards ; in what do they differ ? About light and spices — Bet Shammai declare : Light and afterwards spices, whereas Bet Hillel declare : Spices and afterwards light. But how is it shown that this teaching emanates from Bet Shammai as interpreted by R. Judah ; perhaps it is from Bet Hillel as interpreted by R. Meir[3]? That cannot enter thy mind[4]; for it states here in our Mishnah: Bet Shammai say : [The order of benedictions is] light, food, spices and Habdalah ; but Bet Hillel say : Light, spices, food and Habdalah ; and there in the Baraita it states : "Should he have only one cup [of wine], he leaves it until after the meal and combines all [the benedictions] afterwards[5]." Conclude therefore that it emanates from Bet Shammai as interpreted by R. Judah. 

Nevertheless there is a difficulty[6] ! Bet Shammai hold that the advent of a [holy] day is different from its conclusion ; for with its advent the more we anticipate it the better[1] ; but with its conclusion the later we defer it the better[2], so that it may not seem to us a burden. 

Do Bet Shammai hold that the Grace after meals requires a cup of wine ? For our Mishnah teaches : If wine is brought to them after the food and there is only sufficient for one cup, Bet Shammai declare : He says the benediction over the wine and then over the food[3]. Is it not to be supposed that he says the benediction [over the wine] and then drinks it ? No ; he says the benediction and leaves it [undrunk for the Grace]. But the teacher has said : He who says a benediction must taste ! He does taste [but leaves the greater part]. But the teacher has said : If he tasted it, he disqualifies it [for another benediction] ! He tastes it with his hand[4]. But the master has said : The cup of benediction requires a measure [of a fourth of a Log] ; and lo, he made it less than that measure ! He originally had more than the required measure. But it states: "There is only sufficient for one cup"! There was not sufficient for two cups, but more than enough for one. But R. Hiyya has taught : Bet Shammai declare : He says the benediction over the wine and drinks it, and after that says Grace ! Nay, there are two Tannaim who differ as to the teaching of Bet Shammai[5]. 

II. Bet Shammai say : We wash the hands and then fill the cup, etc. 

Our Rabbis have taught : Bet Shammai say : We wash the hands and then fill the cup ; for if thou sayest that we till the cup first, there is a fear lest the liquid which is on the outside of the cup may contract defilement on account of his hands and in its turn defile the cup[6]. But the hands can defile the cup[7] ! The hands are [only unclean in] the second degree[1], and [anything unclean in] the second degree cannot make a third [unclean grade] with things non-holy except through the medium of a liquid. But Bet Hillel declare : We fill the cup and then wash the hands ; for if thou sayest that we wash the hands first, there is a fear lest the moisture on the hands may contract defilement on account of the cup [which might be ritually unclean] and in its turn defile the hands. But the cup can defile the hands[2]! A vessel[3] cannot make a man contract defilement. But it can defile the liquid which it contains ! We are dealing here with a vessel whose exterior has been defiled by liquid, that is to say whose interior is ritually clean but the exterior unclean ; for there is a Mishnaic teaching : If a vessel's exterior has been defiled by liquid, the exterior is unclean but the interior, edge, brim and handle are clean. If, however, [[fol. 52 b.]] the interior is defiled, then the whole of it becomes unclean. 

What is the point of difference between them ? Bet Shammai hold that it is forbidden to use a vessel whose exterior has become defiled by liquid for fear of the spillings[4], but there is no need to fear lest the moisture of the hand will contract defilement through the cup. Bet Hillel, on the other hand, hold that it is permitted to use a cup whose exterior has become defiled by a liquid, saying that spillings are not frequent ; but there is reason to fear lest the moisture on the hand contract defilement on account of the cup. Another reason is that the meal follows immediately on the washing of the hands. Why this other reason? Thus said Bet Hillel to Bet Shammai : According to you who maintain that it is forbidden to use a cup whose exterior has been defiled because of the fear of spillings, even so it is better [to wash the hands last] because the meal follows immediately on the washing of the hands[5]. 

III. Bet Shammai say : One wipes his hands, etc. 

Our Rabbis have taught : Bet Shammai say : One wipes his hands with a napkin which he lays upon the table ; for if thou sayest that [he lays it] upon the bolster, there is a fear lest the moisture on the napkin may contract defilement on account of the bolster and this in turn may render the hands ritually unclean[6]. 

But the bolster can defile the napkin ! One vessel cannot cause another vessel to contract defilement. But the bolster can make the man unclean! A vessel[1] cannot cause a man to contract defilement. But Bet Hillel say : [He lays it] upon the bolster ; for if thou sayest that [he lays it] upon the table, there is a fear lest the moisture on the napkin may contract defilement on account of the table and in its turn defile the food. But the table can defile the food which is upon it ! We deal here with a table [unclean] in the second degree[2], and [anything unclean in] the second degree cannot make a third [unclean grade] with things non-holy except through the medium of a liquid. 

What is the point of difference between them? Bet Shammai hold that it is forbidden to use a table [unclean in] the second degree through fear of those who are eating Terumah[3]; but Bet Hillel hold that it is permitted to use a table unclean in the second degree, because those who eat Terumah are careful[4]. Another reason is : The washing of the hands for non-holy food is not ordained by the Torah. Why this other reason ? Thus said Bet Hillel to Bet Shammai : Should you ask what difference is there that in the case of food we are concerned [about defilement][5] but in the case of the hands we have no concern ? Even so [our view] is better because the washing of the hands for non-holy food[6] is not ordained by the Torah ; therefore it is preferable that the hands should be defiled, since that has no basis in the Torah, rather than food should be defiled, for which there is a basis in the Torah. 

IV. Bet Shammai say : [After the meal] they clear up, etc. 

Our Rabbis have taught : Bet Shammai say : They clear up and then we wash the hands [before Grace] ; for if thou sayest that we wash the hands first, the consequence may be that thou wilt spoil some food[7]. (Bet Shammai do not hold that the washing of the hands comes first. What is the reason? On account of the pieces of breads[8].) But Bet Hillel say : If the attendant is a disciple of the wise, he takes those pieces of bread which are of the size of an olive and leaves the pieces which are less than that size[1]. This supports the statement of R. Johanan who said : Pieces of bread which are less than the size of an olive may be destroyed by the hand. 

What is the point of difference between them ? Bet Hillel hold that it is forbidden to employ as an attendant one who is an 'Am ha'ares[2], whereas Bet Shammai hold that such may be employed. R. Isaac[3] b. R. Hannina said in the name of Rab Huna: Throughout our Chapter, the Halakah is in agreement with Bet Hillel except in this point where it is in agreement with Bet Shammai. R. Osha'ya, however, teaches the reverse, that here also the Halakah is in agreement with Bet Hillel. 

V. Bet Shammai say: [The order of benedictions is] light, food, etc. 

Rab Huna b. Judah[4] visited the house of Raba[5] and noticed that he said the benediction over the spices first. He said to him : Note that Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel do not differ on the question of the light ; for our Mishnah teaches : Bet Shammai say : [The order is] light, food, spices and Habdalah ; but Bet Hillel say : Light, spices, food and Habdalah[6]! Raba answered after him[7]: These are the words of R. Meir; but R. Judah says: Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel do not differ that [the benediction over] food comes first and Habdalah last. In what do they differ ? In [the order of] light and spices ; for Bet Shammai say : First [the benediction] over the light and then the spices, but Bet Hillel say : First over the spices and then the light. And R. Johanan said : People act in agreement with the view of Bet Hillel as interpreted by R. Judah[8]. 

Bet Shammai say : The wording is "...Who created [bara'] the light [me'or] of fire" etc. 

Raba said : Everybody agrees about bara' that it means "he created." In what do they differ? About the word bore'[1] ; Bet Shammai hold that bore' means "he will create[2]," but Bet Hillel hold that bore' has also the same meaning as bara'. Rab Joseph quoted in objection[3] : "I form the light and create [bore'] darkness" (Is. xlv. 7); "He formeth the mountains and createth [bore'] the wind" (Amos iv. 13); "He that created [bore'] the heavens and stretched them forth" (Is. xlii. 5)! But, said Rab Joseph, everybody agrees that bara' and bore' mean "he created." Wherein do they differ? About meor and meore ["light" and "lights"] for Bet Shammai hold there is only one light in fire, but Bet Hillel hold there are many[4]. There is a teaching to the same effect : Bet Hillel said to Bet Shammai : There are many lights in fire. 

VI. We may not say the benediction over the light or spices of gentiles. 

It is quite right [that we do not use] the light [of a gentile] because it has not "rested[5]" ; but why not the spices ? Rab Judah said in the name of Rab : We are here dealing with [spices used] at the banquet of gentiles[6], because the assumption is that the banquet of gentiles is dedicated to idolatry. But since he teaches in the sequel : We may not say the benediction over the light or spices of idolatry, it is to be inferred that in the first part of the statement we are not dealing with idolatry[7] ! R. Hannina of Sura[8] said : [In the sequel] he merely states the reason : What is the reason that we do not say a benediction over the light or spices of the gentiles ? Because the assumption is the banquet of gentiles is dedicated to idolatry. 

Our Rabbis have taught : We say a benediction over the light which rested but not if it has not rested. What means "rested" and "not rested"? If we would say that it has not rested because [[fol. 53a.]] of work [which has been done on the Sabbath by its illumination], even if it be work which is permitted[1], there is a teaching : We may say the benediction over the light used [on the Sabbath] by a woman in confinement or an invalid ! Rab Nahman b. Isaac[2] said : What means "rested"? It rested from work which is a transgression [on the Sabbath]. There is a teaching to the same effect : We may at the conclusion of the Sabbath say the benediction over [the light of] a lantern which has been burning the whole day[3]. 

Our Rabbis have taught : We may make the benediction over a light kindled by a gentile from an Israelite or kindled by an Israelite from a gentile, but not over a light kindled by a gentile from a gentile. Why is [the light kindled] by a gentile from a gentile different that one may not [say the benediction over it] ? Because it has not "rested." If so, the light kindled by an Israelite from a gentile may likewise not have "rested" ! And shouldest thou say that the light which is prohibited ceases to exist[4] whereas the other is quite a different one and came into being in the hand of the Israelite, there is the teaching : Who causes a flame to issue into the public way [on the Sabbath][5] has incurred guilt ; but why has he incurred guilt ? What he has taken up he has not set down, and what he has set down he has not taken up[6]! There is certainly also a prohibition [about the light kindled by an Israelite from a gentile][7], but when he says the benediction he does so over the additional part which is permitted[8]. If so, a light kindled by a gentile from a gentile should also be allowed ! Really that is so ; but there is a fear because of the first gentile[1] and the first torch[2]. 

Our Rabbis have taught : Were one walking [at the conclusion of the Sabbath] outside the town and saw a light, if the majority [of the inhabitants] are gentiles, he should not say the benediction [over that light], but if the majority are Israelites, he may say it. This is self-contradictory ! Thou sayest, "If the majority are gentiles, he should not say the benediction," hence if they are half [gentiles] and half [Israelites] he may say it. Then it continues, "If the majority are Israelites, he may say it," hence if they are half and half, he may not say it ! It is quite right that even if they are half and half, he should also say the benediction ; but since he taught the first clause "If the majority are gentiles," he also adds "If the majority are Israelites[3]." 

Our Rabbis have taught : Were one walking [at the conclusion of the Sabbath] outside the town and saw a child holding a torch, he makes inquiries ; if the child is an Israelite, he says the benediction [over the lighted torch], but if a gentile, he does not. Why is a child specified? It is the same even with an adult! Rab Judah said in the name of Rab[4]: We are here dealing with a point of time near to the setting of the sun[5]; so if it were an adult, it is obvious that he must certainly be a gentile[6]. But in the case of a child, one might say it is an Israelite and it is by chance that he is holding [the torch]. 

Our Rabbis have taught : Were one walking [at the conclusion of the Sabbath] outside the town and saw a light, if it is as thick as the opening of a furnace he says the benediction over it[7], but if it is not, he does not say the benediction over it. One taught: We do say the benediction over the light of a furnace; but there is another teaching : We do not say the benediction over it ! There is no contradiction ; because the latter refers to the beginning [of its kindling], the other subsequently[8]. One taught : We do say the benediction over the light of an oven or stove ; but there is another teaching: We do not say the benediction over it! There is no contradiction ; because the latter refers to the beginning [of its kindling], the other subsequently. One taught : We do say the benediction over the light of a Synagogue or House of Study ; but there is another teaching : We do not say the benediction over it ! There is no contradiction ; the latter referring to a case where there is a distinguished person[1] present, the other to a case where there is no distinguished person present. But if thou wilt I can say that both refer to where a distinguished person is present, and still there is no contradiction ; the one referring to where there is a beadle[2], the other to where there is no beadle. Or if thou wilt I can say that both refer to where there is a beadle, and still there is no contradiction ; the one referring to where there is moonlight[3] and the other to where there is no moonlight. 

Our Rabbis have taught : If they were sitting in the House of Study [at the conclusion of the Sabbath] and light is brought to them, Bet Shammai declare that each one says the benediction for himself ; but Bet Hillel declare that one says the benediction for all, because it is said, "In the multitude of people is the King's glory" (Prov. xiv. 28)[4]. It is quite right that Bet Hillel explain the reason [for their view] ; but what is the reason of Bet Shammai ? They hold that it will cause an interruption in the House of Study[5]. There is a teaching to the same effect : Those who belonged to the school of Rabban Gamaliel used not to exclaim Marpe'[6] in the House of Study because of the interruption it causes. 

We may not say the benediction over the light or spices of the dead. 

What is the reason ? The light which is kindled [for the dead] is in its honour[1] and the spices are used to remove the odour[2]. Rab Judah said in the name of Rab[3]: Over a light which they carry before [the corpse] by day or by night[4] no benediction is to be made[5] ; but we may say it over a light which is only carried before it at night[6].
 
Rab Huna said : We may not say the benediction over spices used in a privy[7] or the oil which is used to remove the dirt[8]. That is to say that the benediction [for spices] is not to be pronounced over anything which is not used for the purpose of smelling. Against this is quoted : If one enters a perfumer's shop and smells the odour, even though he sit there all day he only pronounces the benediction once ; but if he keeps going in and out, he pronounces it each time. But here [the perfume] was not for smelling[9] and still he says the benediction ! Yes, it is there for smelling, so that people should smell it and come to buy. 

Our Rabbis have taught : Were one walking outside the town and smelt a fragrant odour, if the majority [of the inhabitants] are gentiles, he must not pronounce a benediction ; but if the majority are Israelites, he does. R. Jose said : Even if the majority are Israelites he must likewise not pronounce a benediction, because the daughters of Israel use incense for purposes of sorcery[10]. But do all of them burn incense for sorcery ? Some for sorcery and some also to perfume their garments ; hence it will be found that the majority [in the town] do not use it for smelling, and where the majority do not use it for smelling, the benediction is not to be pronounced. R. Hiyya b. Abba said in the name of R. Johanan : He who walks on the Sabbath-eve in Tiberias[1] and at the conclusion of the Sabbath in Sepphoris[2] and smells a fragrant odour should not pronounce the benediction because the presumption is that it is only being used to perfume garments. 

Our Rabbis have taught : If one were walking in a street where idolatry [is practised] and takes pleasure in smelling the odour [of incense] he is a sinner. 

Nor do we say the benediction over the light until one can make [[fol. 53 b.]] Use of its illumination. 

Rab Judah said in the name of Rab : The phrase "until one can make use of its illumination" does not mean that one must actually use it, but if one who stands near to it can use its light, then even those who are at a distance [may say the benediction]. Similarly said Rab Ashe[3] : We have learnt that one at a distance [may say the benediction]. Against this is quoted : If he had a light hidden in his bosom or in a lantern or saw a flame but made no use of its light or used its light without seeing its flame, he must not say the benediction until he sees the flame and makes use of its light ! It is quite right that one uses the light without seeing the flame, for it may happen to stand in a corner ; but how is it possible to see the flame without using its light? Is it not when it is far off? No, it refers to when it keeps growing dimmer. 

Our Rabbis have taught : We may say the benediction over glowing coals, but not over dying coals[4]. What is to be understood by glowing coals? Rab Hisda said : When one puts a chip of wood to them and it ignites. The question was asked : Is the word for dying coals spelt 'omemot or 'omemot[5]? Come and hear : For Rab Hisda[6] b. Abdemi quoted, "The cedars in the garden of God could not darken ['amam] it" (Ezek. xxxi. 8)[7]. 

Raba said : [The statement of the Mishnah means] one must actually use the illumination[8]. And how [near must he be to the light] ? 'Ulla said[9] : Sufficient for one to be able to distinguish between an as and a dupondium[1]. Hezekiah said : Sufficient for one to be able to distinguish between the stamp[2] of a Tiberian coin and a Sepphorian coin. Rab Judah said the benediction over the light in the house of Ada the waiter[3]. Raba[4] said it over the light in the house of Guria[5] b. Hamma. Abbai said it over the light in the house of Bar Abbuha[6]. Rab Judah said in the name of Rab : One does not go looking for a light[7] as we do for other commandments. R. Zera said : At first I used to go about [searching for a light] but since I heard the statement of Rab Judah in the name of Rab, I also do not go searching for it ; but should it chance to me of its own accord, I say the benediction[8]. 

VII. If one ate and forgot to say Grace, etc. 

Rab Zebid[9] (another version : Rab Dimai b. Abba) said : The dispute is only in the case of one who has forgotten ; but if he omitted it intentionally, all agree that he must return to his place and say Grace. This is obvious, because the Mishnah states "and forgot"! Thou mayest, however, argue that the same thing applies[10] to one who omitted it intentionally and the statement "he forgot" is only intended to show the extreme view of Bet Shammai ; therefore he informs us[11]. There is a teaching : Bet Hillel said to Bet Shammai : According to your words, he who ate at the top of the Temple Mount and forgot and descended without saying Grace must return to the top and say it! Bet Shammai replied to Bet Hillel : According to your words, if one left a purse at the top of the Temple Mount, should he not go up to fetch it? For his own purpose[1] he may go up ; how much more so for the honour of Heaven ! There were two disciples ; one acted in error according to the view of Bet Shammai[2] and found a purse of gold, and the other acted deliberately according to the view of Bet Hillel[3] and a lion devoured him. 

Rabbah b. Bar Hannah was journeying with a caravan ; he ate but forgot to say Grace. He said [to himself], "How shall I act ? If I tell them I have forgotten to say Grace, they will answer, 'Say it now ; for wherever thou utterest a benediction it is to the All-merciful thou dost utter it.' It is better that I tell them I have lost a golden dove." He said to them, "Wait for me, because I have lost a golden dove." He went back, said Grace and found a golden dove. Why exactly a dove ? Because the Community of Israel is likened to a dove ; for it is written, "The wings of the dove are covered with silver, and her pinions with the shimmer of gold" (Ps. Ixviii. 14). Just as a dove only escapes with the aid of its wings, so Israel is only delivered through the aid of the commandments. 

And what length of time may elapse, etc. 

What is the length of time for food to be digested ? R. Johanan said : As long as he is not hungry. R. Simeon b. Lakish said : As long as he is thirsty on account of the food he has eaten. Rab Jemar b. Shelamya said to Mar Zotra (another version : Rab Jemar b. Shezbi to Mar Zotra) : Did R. Simeon b. Lakish say that? For lo, R. Ammi declared in the name of R. Simeon b. Lakish : What is the length of time for food to be digested ? Sufficient time for a person to walk four Mil ! There is no contradiction, one referring to a heavy meal, the other to a light meal[4]. 

VIII. If wine is brought to them, etc. 

That is to say an Israelite may respond although he has not heard the whole of the benediction. But since he has not heard it, how can he fulfil his obligation[5]? Hiyya b. Rab[6] said: refers to a man] who has not eaten with them[1]. Similarly said Rab Nahman in the name of[2] Rabbah b. Abbuha : It refers to a man who has eaten with them. Rab[3] said to his son Hiyya, "My son, snatch [the cup of wine] and say Grace[4]" ; and similarly said Rab Huna to his son Rabbah[5], "Snatch [the cup of wine] and say Grace." That is to say, he who says Grace is superior to him who just responds "Amen"[6] ; but lo, there is a teaching : R. Jose says : Greater is he who responds "Amen" than he who says Grace! R. Nehorai[7] said to him : By Heaven it is so. Thou canst prove it ; for behold the common soldiers go down to open the fight but the veterans go down to win the victory[8]. This matter is discussed by the Tannaim; for there is a teaching : Both he who says the benediction and he who responds "Amen" are implied[9], only he who says the benediction is more quickly [rewarded] than he who responds "Amen." 

Samuel asked Rab : Should one respond "Amen" after the children in school[10]? He replied : We make the response "Amen" after everybody except school-children, because they only utter [the benediction] for the purpose of learning it. This rule applies when it is not the time that they read the Haftarah ; but should it be the time when they read the Haftarah, one does make the response. 

Our Rabbis have taught : The oil prevents the Grace [from beign said][11] — these are the words of R.[12]Zilai ; but R. Ziwai says ; It does not prevent it. R. Aha says : Good oil prevents it. R. Zohamai says : Just as one who is dirty is unfit for the Temple-service, so are dirty hands unfit for the Grace. Rab Nahman b. Isaac said : I know neither Zilai nor Ziwai nor Zohamai ; but I know the following teaching : Rab Judah said in the name of Rab (another version : it is taught in a Baraita) : "Sanctify yourselves" (Lev. xi. 44) — i.e. the washing before the meal[1] ; "and be ye holy" (ibid.) — i.e. the washing after the meal ; "for holy" (ibid.) — i.e. the oil ; "I am the Lord your God[2]" — i.e. the Grace. 

May we return unto thee : The following are the points of variance !
