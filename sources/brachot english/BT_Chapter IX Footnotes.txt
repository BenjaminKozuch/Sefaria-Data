1 Lit. great sea. 

2 A fortified town is here intended in which is a military governor, who is usually a tyrant and does not rule justly. 

3 It has been suggested that this exhortation is directed against Sadducean teaching; cf. Lehmann in R. E. J. xxxi. pp. 31 ff. 

=================================================

1 The idea of two is derived from the spelling of the word for "heart" — *** instead of ***; see A. P. A. ii. p. 15 n. 3. 

2 Lit. for a world. 

3 Some edd. read "Sadducees"; and they are intended here as they denied the future life. See p. 100. 

4 Lit. "from the world to the world" — two worlds. 

5 Viz. the Tetragrammaton J H W H, usually rendered "the Lord" which the Jews pronounced Adonai. Wiesner, pp. 118 f., conjectures that this is directed against the Samaritans who substituted for JHWH the word ha-Shem "the Name." Hence by using the word Adonai in his salutation, it would be recognised that it was a Jew, not a Samaritan, who was speaking. 

6 The application of this verse to the subject-matter will be explained on fol. 63 a, p. 417. 

=================================================

1 That a benediction is required when one beholds a place where a miracle occurred. According to Rashi the reading is : Whence is it that we have to say a benediction for a miracle? 

2 M.: 'Eber Jardena; i.e. "the other side of the Jordan." Rashi explains : A district to the S. of the Euphrates. Wiesner, p. 120, connects 'Eber with the Babylonian river Chabor ; hence the phrase means : the right, or N. bank of the Chabor. 

3 The district between the Chabor and the canal of Is; Wiesner, p. 121. 

4 A town on the Tigris, identified with the fortified Maogamalcha; Neubauer, pp. 356 f . 

5 The question above whether a benediction is to be said for the miracle which happens to an individual. 

6 Even if he had not experienced it himself. 

7 Isaac Alfasi (the medieval Talmudist) reads : He, his son and his grandson. 

8 See Josh. x. 11. 

9 M. and some edd. read: Moses. 

=================================================

1 See Exod, xvii. 12. 

2 See Gen. xix. 26. 

3 This word, occurring in the Hebrew text, is omitted in edd. M. inserts it. 

4 R.V. "Vaheb in Suphah"; marg. "in storm." 

5 The first word is read ashad instead of eshed, "the slopes of," in the Biblical text. As rendered here, the verse means that the hills on the Ar side of the valley inclined towards the hills on the Moab side, so that the Amorites were crushed in between. Wiesner, p. 122, points out that this Aggadah seems to have been known to the author of the Vulgate: Unde dicitur in libro bellorum Domini : Sicut fecit in Mari rubro, sic faciet in torrentibus Arnon, Scopuli torrentium inclinati sunt ut requiescereut in Ar, et recumberent in finibus Moabitarum. 

6 "For the sake of a man" in Hebrew 'al gab ish. 

=================================================

1 I.e. they were descending but stopped half-way. 

2 The Talmud inserts here "the children of" which is not in the Biblical text. 

3 About 15 feet. 

4 Which was accordingly 45 ft. from the ground. 

5 The words in brackets are not in edd., but are added by M. They are to be found in the Mekilta ad loc. (ed. Friedmann, p. 54 b), Ta'anit 11a. 

6 The existence of this salt-pillar is referred to in the Apocrypha, Wisdom of Solomon, x. 7. Josephus (Antiq. i. xi. 4) claims to have seen it. Edd. insert here: And the wall of Jericho which was swallowed up; as it is written, "And the wall fell down flat" (Josh. vi. 20). But it disturbs the connection and is dealt with in the following paragraph. 

=================================================

Page 353
---------
1 That a benediction should be said on beholding their site. 

2 And a benediction would be out of place. 

3 Usually said on hearing bad news. 

4 For if it had fallen on its side, the obstacle would have remained the same. But the Bible states "the people went up into the city, every man straight before him," i.e. with nothing in the way. Consequently the wall must have sunk into the ground. 

5 M. and some edd. omit "in the name of Rab." 

6 And return in safety. 

=================================================

1 For the modern form, see Singer, p. 148. 

2 M.: Raba. 

3 M. assigns this remark to Rabina. 

4 M.: Huna. 

5 Perhaps the modern Eski Bagdad in Babylon; Neubauer, p. 360. 

6 Against evil spirits. 

7 M. omits. 

8 On the belief that women in childbirth are liable to attack by evil spirits, of. Frazer, Folklore of the Old Testament, iii. pp. 472 ff.; for bridegroom and bride, i. pp. 520 ff.; and for mourners, iii. pp. 236, 298 ff. 

9 Whom the evil spirits tempt to lapses from morality.

1 See fol. 32 b, p. 215. 

2 Because it is tempting Providence. 

3 Thereby sbowing over-confidence in his innocence. 

4 When he has the poor as his guests. Cf. "Let the poor be the members of thy household"; Abot i. 5, Singer, p. 185. Although this is the interpretation required by the context, Bacher (following Epstein) thinks that the dictum originally referred to the ritualistic purity of the daily meals; cf. A. P. A. I. p. 225 n. 2. 

5 Wunsche renders: Zehn Dinge bringen den Menschen zu den Unteren (d.i. unter die Erde); but this is improbable. 

6 Lit. threshing sledge. According to Rashi : all parts of the animal which are rough and indented. 

7 M. adds: without salt. 

=================================================

1 In the parallel passage (Nedarim 49 b) it is not a matron but a Min. To refer to indelicate matters like this in conversation between the sexes is common in the East. Cf. Lane, p. 473. 

2 I.e. fresh and healthy-looking. 

3 M. adds : in the name of Rab. 

4 The last phrase might also mean, to occupy a position of authority. 

5 And the one who says Grace blesses his host. 

6 M.: R. Hiyya said. 

7 This is deduced from Exod. i. 6, "And Joseph died and (sc. then) all his brethren." 

8 Sic. R.V. "Recover Thou me." The root of the word is identical with the letters in the word for "dream." 

=================================================

---------
1 That is the order in Exod. xxxi. 7 f. 

2 Thus in Exod. xxv. 10 the Ark is mentioned; ibid. vv. 23 and 31 we have the table and candlestick, i.e. "the vessels"; and in xxvi. 1 the tabernacle. 

3 Besel el, hence Besalel. 

4 Knowledge derived from the mystic art. See Abelson, Jewish Mysticism, pp. 100 f. and Ginsburg, The Kabbalah, pp. 153 ff. 

=================================================

---------
1 Lit. son of the West. 

2 It was always considered preferable to find authority for an opinion in the Pentateuch than in other parts of the Bible. 

3 The original is obscure, and the reading of M. *** should be adopted instead of ***. The 'Aruk gives it a reverse meaning : Every dream has some reality, except that which one dreams while fasting. Against this interpretation is the commonly held idea that a full stomach prevents dreams (cf. p. 90 n. 8), and that a morning-dream (when the stomach is empty) has great significance. See next folio, p. 363. 

4 Has no effect for good or evil, because it depends upon the interpretation, as will be explained later.  

5 Because it leads to searching of heart and contrition. 

6 He was blind, and consequently his joy would be less than that of one possessed of sight. 

7 Most of the statements in this paragraph seem to have the purpose of belittling the importance of dreams. 

=================================================

1 Represented in the dream by "the moon." 

2 At that age he had the dream. 

3 When his brothers bowed before him ; cf. Gen. xlv. 6. 

4 If he dreams at all, it is a bad dream. For the reason see p. 358 n. 5. 

5 His dreams are good, so that he may enjoy this world, since he will be debarred from the joys of the next world. 

6 M. and some edd. insert here : "Neither shall any plagae come nigh thy tent" (ibid.)— i.e. thou shalt not find thy wife in doubt whether she be menstrual when thou returnest from a journey. The words disturb the connection. 

7 The parallel passage (fol. 14a, p. 90) reads: R. Jonah in the name of R. Zera. M.: R. Zera in the name of R. Jannai. The correct reading is probably R. Jannai [II] said in the name of R. Zera. Cf. D. S. ad loc. and Hyman, II. p. 765 a. 

8 See p. 90 n. 9. 

9 And without interpretation it can have no effect. 

10 M. omits: b. Ammi. According to Hyman, III. p. 1009 a, the correct reading is Hanan b. Ammi. 

11 Because it was a bad dream.

1 The prayer which follows was included in the Prayer Book to be recited by the entire Congregation, whether they had dreamed or not, during the Priestly Benediction by the Kohanim in the Synagogue; but the modern editions omit it and it is falling into disuse. 

2 M. adds the words in brackets. 

3 Some authorities and the Prayer Book insert here : as Naaman from his leprosy. 

4 I.e. if he cannot finish together with them. But instead of these words, some authorities read: "When [at the conclusion of the beuediction] the Kohanim turn their faces [from the people to the Ark]." On this ceremony, see J. E. III. pp. 244 ff. 

5 M.: a house. 

6 See p. 131 n. 4. Here it seems to mean the sensual passion. On this method of charming away the Evil Eye, see Feldman, The Jewish Child, p. 193. 

7 In the parallel passage (fol. 20a, p. 131) it is: R. Abbahu said: Read not. 

8 The sons of Joseph. 

=================================================

Page 362
---------
1 M.: R. Bizta stated that R. Zera said in the name of R. 'Ukba...R. Pabna...R. Tanhum...R. Parna...who is he? R. Nehorai. 

2 Bacher considers *** "the mouth" to have been originally ***, abbreviation for *** "the interpretations." See R. E. J. xxvii. pp. 141 ff. 

3 This question is asked because "That which was said" is a formula to introduce a Biblical quotation. 

=================================================

Page 363
---------
1 I.e. how did the baker know about the butler's dream and its interpretation? The Bible does not mention that he had been told but that he saw. 

2 Spontaneously. Or it may refer to hearing a chance verse quoted, e.g. by school-children, this being regarded as a kind of oracle; cf. T. A. III. p. 228, and for some examples from Rabbinic literature, ibid. p. 353 n. 229. It may be compared with the practice of opening the Bible in haphazard manner to find in the page a helpful reference. 

3 M.: Raba said: Whence is it that a man is only shown, etc. 

4 M.: Rab Joseph. 

5 Because he never thinks of such things. 

6 The parallel passage (Bekorot 8b) has Hananyah, correctly. 

7 The mention of R. Joshua b. Hananyah in connection with the Persian-Roman Wars would be an anachronism. For "Persians" we should probably read "Parthians"; and we may have here a reminiscence of the defeat of Trajan in 116 c.E. 

8 Used as fodder for camels. 

9 There is no historical record of Shapor I having been taken prisoner by Rome. 

=================================================

1 The parallel passage (Jebamot 63 b) reads Rab Hanan b. Raba; and M. omits: in the name of R. Jeremiah...is written.

1 They will say that if Raba is suspected, surely suspicion will fall on us. Thus "they shall be afraid of thee." 

2 Both Abbai and Raba dealt in wine. 

3 Rashi explains : sweet to the buyer because of its cheapness. 

4 A proverbial expression quoted from Shab. 66 b. 

5 Exod. xiii. 11 ff. is one of the four passages written on the parchment contained in the phylacteries. 

=================================================

---------
1 M. adds: Raba looked and saw that it was erased. The word hamor should be here spelt without the waw. The Scribe wrongly inserted the letter and then erased it. 

2 The wife, being the mistress of the house, is compared to the door which makes it secure. 

3 On the comparison of a wife (or beloved) to a dove, cf. Cant. v. 2. 

4 The turnip-top, resembling a stick, suggested a blow. 

5 Thinking that there be would be safe from the fulfilment of the interpretation. 

6 As read on the Passover-night to celebrate the miracles performed in Egypt. 

7 He was afraid the boat would sink and Raba miraculously escape, but not he. 

8 I.e. a book on dreams, as the sequel shows. 

=================================================

---------
1 M. inserts : my sons and daughters and. 

2 Raba's wife whose death was foretold. 

3 M. adds : Perhaps it will bring me expiation. 

4 M. adds: half. 

5 Reading debe for deresh; cf. Jastrow, p. 526b and T. A. I. p. 525 n. 51. 

6 Rashi gives the word the meaning "worm." 

7 The cheekbone indicated the mouth which spoke the plot. 

8 M. inserts: Simeon. 

9 The Hebrew word for "nose" also has the meaning "anger." 

=================================================

Page 368
---------
1 M.: Simeon b. Joseph ; but D. S. thinks the true reading to be R. Ishmael b. R. Jose, which is adopted by Bacher, A. T. I. p. 257 n. 6. 

2 When the interpretation refers to a moral delinquency, the reply is in the third person. 

3 A district in Asia Minor. 

4 In this version, the name is regarded as a combination of the Aramaic Kofa "a beam," and the Greek *** "ten." But there is another version in the Palestinian Talmud, Ma'aser Sheni, iv. 55b, where it is considered to be made up of *** "twenty" and *** "beams." See Krauss, p. 559. 

=================================================

---------
1 "Living" water being a symbol of peace. 

2 Read probably R. Jonathan ; cf. A. P. A. I. p. 64 n. 2. 

3 By the argument Gezerah Shawah (see p. 18 n. 5) it is deduced that it was Torah that Isaac discovered. 

4 M. : Hannina. 

5 The word here used, shapat, is commonly used in the sense of setting a pot on the fire. 

6 For *** read ***. 

7 Hence "flesh within the caldron" denotes strife, not peace. 

=================================================

Page 370
---------

1 The word "get" is repeated, hence the plural "reeds." 

2 Because of the resemblance of the words to "reed" which has a favourable interpretation. 

3 M.: Rab Joseph taught. 

4 Because of the resemblance of the word for "gourd" with "My eyes fail with looking upward" (Is. xxxviii. 14). 

5 Lit. gore. 

=================================================

Page 371
---------
1 M.: the Messiah. 

2 M. reads : Where the word for it is Shunnara, a change for the worse is in store for him; where the word for it is Shurana, a beautiful song will be composed in his honour. 

3 M. adds : He should offer up supplication. If [he dreamt] that he had eaten them, he is assured that he is a son of the world to come. 

4 Cf. Gen. xxi. 17. 

5 The Arabs were descended from Ishmael. 

6 M.: Abba. 

7 "Surely bring up," in Hebrew gam 'aloh, which suggests gamal "camel" 

8 M. omits: b. Isaac. 

9 The word "also," gam, is connected with ***, with the meaning of "camel." In place of this verse there is a variant in which Ps. lii. 7 is quoted ; Bacher, A. B. A. (2nd ed.) add. p. 13. 

10 In Sanh. 82 b it is related of Phineas that when interceding for Israel, he overcame the opposition of the ministering angels and wrought wonders for his people. 

=================================================

Page 372
---------
1 Because the name contains the letter N, the initial of the word nes, "miracle." The other names mentioned have the letter more than once. 

2 Funeral oration. The first two letters of the word are connected with hus "to have pity" and the last two with padah "to redeem." 

3 And does not dream of attending a funeral oration. 

4 M. adds : like Moses our teacher. 

5 See fol. 6 a, p. 29. 

6 I.e. he wakes up before the Tefillah is ended. 

7 Suetonius, Julius Caesar, § 7, relates that Caesar had such a dream, and it was interpreted to mean that he was destined for high rank. (Wiesner, p. 128.) 

8 The textual rendering is "Yea if thou wilt call for understanding." But im "if" is read as em "mother." 

=================================================

Page 373
---------
1 M. omits. 

2 Se'orim "barley" suggests sar 'awon "iniquity has departed." 

3 It was popularly thought that a visit to the Holy Land brought expiation for sin. See p. 375 n. 2. 

4 This verse having a Messianic significance. 

5 The Torah is compared to the fig-tree, 'Erubin 54 a, bot. 

=================================================

Page 374
---------
1 Temarim "palms" suggests tammu morim "finished are the rebels (i.e. sinners)." 

2 Which has numerous leaves. 

3 Among the Romans the goose was deemed a wise animal (Wiesner, p. 128). 

4 He became Principal of the Seminary in Sura. 

5 Tarnegol "hen" suggests the interpretation that follows. 

6 Rashi explains that while the egg-shell remains unbroken, one is doubtful of its contents. Pinner suggests that the interpretation may be due to resemblance between the Aramaic words for "egg" and "petition"; and as when the egg is broken it is finished with, that suggests a petition granted. The Rev. A. Newman writes, "A spherical body, like an egg, cannot stand firm. Hence, as the egg is unstable, so is the fulfilment of the petition uncertain." 

7 See p. 370. 

=================================================
Page 375
---------
1 The Hebrew words for "bent down" and "excrement" are somewhat similar in sound. 

2 And will not be deposed. 

3 The interpretation is explained by two Talmudical statements: "Who dwells in the Land of Israel abides sinless" (Ketubot 111 a) and "Who dwells outside the Land of Israel is as though he worshipped idols" (ibid. 110 b). Therefore naked in Babylon means without the sins one would expect there; and naked in Palestine means without having fulfilled the commandments which distinguish Jewish life there from that elsewhere. 

4 And is securely guarded by them. 

5 Indicating additional precautions. 

6 Where there are large and small reeds, figurative of students of different ages. 

7 Where all the trees are full-grown, representing mature students. 

8 A drum was carried in the East before a man of eminence and beaten to attract attention and secure respectful salutation. 

9 He was subsequently appointed Principal of the Seminary in Sura. 

=================================================

1 M. omits: b. Isaac.  

2 Sins are described as crimson, Is. i. 18. 

3 He accordingly wished to give it a favourable interpretation. 

4 M. : Rab Nahman. 

5 Repeated from fol. 55 b, p. 363. 

6 This sentence is out of place, and is omitted by M.

1 I.e. Judah the Prince; but M. reads "R. 'Akiba." 

2 He was very rich ; see fol. 27 b, p. 181. 

3 He suffered martyrdom under the Romans. See p. 35 n. 2. 

4 They are not called "Sages" because they had not received ordination as Rabbis. 

5 He was renowned as an ascetic; cf. Graetz, Gnosticismus and Judentum, pp.71f. 

6 Lit. "another," the name given to Elisha b. Abuya who became a heretic. See Hagigah 15 a, ed. Streane, pp. 83 ff. 

7 Read with M. kippof for kippod. 

8 See fol. 56 b, p. 372. 

9 M. adds: Ashe. 

10 It is very doubtful whether the last word kurperai means "bat." M. omits it here, but precedes this sentence with : To dream of any kind of reptile is a good omen with the exception of the mole (kupedai). 

11 See p. 214 n. 4. 

=================================================

1 Often mentioned together in the Talmud as being intimate friends. Antoninus is often identified with Marcus Aurelias. See J. E. I. pp. 656 f. The latest and most exhaustive investigation of the material is by Krauss, Antoninus und Rabbi, who identifies him with Avidius Cassius, a famous general of Marcus Aurelius and Procurator of Judea. 

2 Indicating a journey. 

3 Indicating a grave and what grows upon it.

1 Possibly referring to the debris of the ruins to be used as building material elsewhere. But cf. T. A. I. p. 289 n. 171. 

2 It was to become perpetual ruins, and thus an eyesore to bordering States ; whereas Samaria was to become a vineyard plantation. 

3 Knowing what is in the heart of each one. 

4 To attend to my wants, as explained in the next paragraph.

I The text reads "peoples"; but the emendation *** for *** yields better sense. M. omits the sentence. 

2 M.: Rab in the name of R. Abbahu. 

3 Some edd. read : to fiesb and blood. 

4 Cf. fol. 9 b, p. 56 and 19 b, pp. 127 f.

1 A proverbial expression meaning, as it is useless to take a piece of broken earthenware to draw water, so is it useless for a blind man to go to witness a procession. 

2 Although blind. 

3 Some edd., fearing the Censor, read "Egyptian." 

4 See p. 7 n. 5.

1 I.e. they give him the right to inflict punishment. 

2 Deduced from Exod. xxii. 1. 

3 M. adds these words. 

4 This is probably the original reading, which has been corrupted for the sake of the Censor. M. reads "the wicked kingdom" and some edd. have "Babylon." 

5 See fol. 54 a, b, p. 351.

2 "Name of Rab" is the reading of the parallel passage, Bab. Bat. 91 b, and is to be adopted. Cf. Hyman, II. p. 469 a. Edd.: R. Johanan. 

3 A very lowly office, filled by one of the lowest class. 

4 After the destruction, Jerusalem was compared to a widow; Lam. i. 1. 

5 M.: Nathan. 

6 "Sixty" is often used in the Talmud not literally, but to denote an indefinite number. 

7 Rab Hanna b. Hanilai. 

=================================================

---------
1 M.: Rab Nahman said; and D.S. mentions another variant, Rab Nahman b. Isaac. 

2 I.e. why should Rab Hanna's house meet with a better fate than the Temple which had been destroyed? 

3 What follows is included in the Burial Service; see Singer, p. 319. 

4 M. adds: b. Isaac. 

5 M. inserts here: What is the Scriptural authority for this? Rab Aha b. Rab Jacob said. 

6 If an article was lost and not found within twelve months, it was deemed irrecoverable.

1 The benediction to be said on beholding a "crowd" of Israelites; see the preceding folio. 

2 They were apparently annoyed by his excessive praise in comparing them with the sixty myriads of the house of Israel and suspected him of sarcasm. He would in that case have used the Divine Name in the benediction disrespectfully. 

3 Which obviously happened after birth. 

4 Wiesner (p. 186) sees here a trace of the idea that the souls of the wicked are made to inhabit the bodies of such animals. Cf. Sanh. 109 a. 

5 Rashi explains this to mean "shooting stars." Other commentators hazard "comet." The 'Aruk translates Zikin "comets" and K. di-S. "shooting stars." They both probably mean "shooting stars." On this astronomical passage, see Brodetsky, J. R. II. pp. 167 ff.

3 There are "seven heavens of which the first, Vilon, was merely a 'curtain' which was withdrawn by day and replaced by night, thus alternately exposing and hiding the Sun, which, together with the moon, planets, and stars, was fixed to the second, Rekia'." Brodetsky, loc. cit. p. 171.
