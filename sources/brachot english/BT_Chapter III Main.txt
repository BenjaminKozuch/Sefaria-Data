
CHAPTER III 

MISHNAH I, II 

I. He whose dead is lying before him [unburied] is exempt from the reading of the Shema', from Tefillah, Tefillin and all the commandments mentioned in the Torah. The bearers of the bier and they who relieve them, and they who relieve these latter — such as are before the bier[1] and such as are behind it[2] — they who are before it, whose services will be required, are exempt ; but they who are behind it, whose services may still be required, are under the obligation. But both are exempt from the Tefillah. 

II. Having buried the dead and returned [from the grave], if they have sufficient time to begin and finish [the Shema'] before arriving at the row[3], they should commence it ; but if they have not sufficient time, they should not commence it. As for those who stand in the row, the inner line is exempt, the outer line under the obligation[4]. 

GEMARA 

When the body is lying before him, he is exempt; [it is consequently to be inferred that] when it is not lying before him, he is not exempt ! I quote in objection : He whose dead is lying before him should eat his meal in another room, and if he has no other room he should eat in a neighbour's house ; if such be not available, he should put up a partition and have his meal ; if he has nothing wherewith to make a partition, he should turn his face away [from the body] and eat. But he must not have his meal in a reclining position[5], or partake of meat or drink wine ; nor does [[fol. 18 a.]] he say Grace or arrange Zimmun, nor do others say Grace on his behalf or include him for Zimmun. He is likewise exempt from the reading of the Shema', from Tefillah, Tefillin, and all the commandments mentioned in the Torah. On the Sabbath, however, he may recline at his meal, eat meat and drink wine, say Grace and arrange Zimmun, and others may say Grace on his behalf and include him for Zimmun ; and he is under the obligation of reading the Shema' and Tefillah[1], and all the commandments mentioned in the Torah. Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel[2] says : Since he is under the obligation of these[3], he has obviously the obligation of them all ! And R. Johanan asked : What is the point of divergence between them[4]? The question of connubial intercourse[5]. 

It is here at any rate taught that [the mourner, although he is not in the same room as the body[6],] is exempt from reading the Shema', from Tefillah, Tefillin, and all the commandments mentioned in the Torah ! Rab Pappa replied : [The Baraita] is to be interpreted as referring to one who turns his face from the body and eats[7]. Rab Ashe said : Since the duty of burying rests upon him, it is to be regarded as though the body was lying before him[8]; as it is said, "And Abraham rose up from before his dead" (Gen. xxiii. 3) and it is said "That I may bury my dead from before me" (ibid. v. 4)[9], i.e. so long as the duty of burial rested upon him, it was as though the body was actually before him. 

He whose dead [is lying before him] is exempt, but [so it may The be inferred,] not the watcher[10]. But lo, there is a teaching : Who watches the body, although it is not his dead, is exempt from reading the Shema', from Tefillah, Tefillin, and all the commandments mentioned in the Torah ! "Who watches the body, although it is not his dead" [so stated the Baraita ; therefore it is to be inferred] if it is his dead, although he does not watch the body, [he is exempt]. If it be his dead or if he watches it, he is exempt ; but [so it may be inferred] one who walks in a cemetery is not ! But lo, there is a teaching : A man must not walk in a cemetery with his Tefillin on his head or holding a scroll of the Torah and reading therein ; should he do so, he commits a transgression because of the injunction : "Whoso mocketh the poor blasphemeth his Maker" (Prov. xvii. 5)[1] ! In this latter case, within four cubits [of the grave] it is forbidden, but beyond that limit, he is under the obligation ; for the teacher has said : A dead body affects four cubits with regard to the reading of the Shema'. But here [in the case of a mourner or watcher], even beyond the limit of four cubits he is exempt. 

It was stated above [in the Baraita] : "Who watches the body, although it is not his dead, is exempt from reading the Shema', from Tefillah, Tefillin, and all the commandments mentioned in the Torah." Should there be two [watchers], they take it in turn to watch and read. Ben 'Azzai says : Should they be bringing the body in a boat, they place it in one corner and they both pray in another corner[2] ! What is the point of divergence between them ? Rabina said : They differ whether we have fear of mice [gnawing the body] ; the former holds there is such fear, the other there is not. 

Our Rabbis have taught : He who is removing bones from one place to another must not put them into a saddle-bag and set them upon an ass and ride upon them, because this is disrespectful treatment ; but if he is afraid of heathens or robbers, he may do so[3]. What they say of bones applies also to a scroll of the Torah. To which [clause in this teaching does this last statement refer] ? If to the first clause, it is self-evident ; for is a scroll of the Torah less than bones? Nay; it refers to the second clause[4]. 

Rahbah said in the name of R. Judah : Whoever sees a body [being conveyed to burial] and does not accompany it[5] commits a transgression because of [the injunction] "Whoso mocketh the poor blasphemeth his Maker" (Prov. xvii. 5). If he accompany it, what is his reward ? Rab Assi said : Of him the Scriptures state, "He that is gracious to the poor lendeth unto the Lord" (ibid. xix. 17) and "he that is gracious unto the needy honoureth Him" (ibid. xiv. 31)[1].

R. Hiyya and R. Jonathan were conversing as they walked in a cemetery, and the "fringes" belonging to R. Jonathan fell upon the graves[2]. R. Hiyya said to him, "Lift them up, so that [the dead] shall not say, 'To-morrow they will come to us, but to-day they revile us'." He asked him, "Do they know all that ; for lo, it is written, 'The dead know not anything' (Eccles. ix. 5)?" He answered, "If thou hast read [this verse], thou hast not read it a second time ; if a second time, then not a third time ; and if a third time, its meaning has not been explained to thee. 'For the living know that they shall die' (ibid.) — this refers to the righteous who are called living even in their death ; as it is said, 'And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a living man[3] of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he smote the two altar-hearths of Moab ; he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow' (II Sam. xxiii. 20). — 'Son of a living [[fol. 18b. ]] man !' Are there, then, in the whole world sons [born of! dead men ? But, 'son of a living man' [means] even in his death he is called 'living.' 'Of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds' — [he is so described] because he multiplied and gathered labourers for the Torah[4]. 'He smote the two altar-hearths of Moab[5]' — i.e. he left nobody like him, neither [in the time of] the first Temple nor the Second Temple. 'He went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow' — some say : He cut a hole in the ice into which he descended to bathe[6]; others say : He learnt the Sifra debe Rab[7] in a winter's day. 'But the dead know not anything' — this refers to the wicked who are called dead in their life-time; as it is said, 'And thou, O wicked one, thou art slain, the prince of Israel' (Ezek. xxi. 30)[1]." Or if thou wilt, derive it from the following : "At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall the dead be put to death" (Deut. xvii. 6). But he is alive ! Nay, he is accounted as dead from the beginning. 

The sons of R. Hiyya[2] went out on to the land[3]; their studies had been difficult for them, and they had had considerable trouble to remember them. One said to the other, "Does our father[4] know of this trouble?" The other replied, "How should he know ? Lo, it is written, 'His sons come to honour him, and he knoweth it not' (Job xiv. 21)!" The first said to him, "But does he not know ; for behold it is written, 'But his flesh grieveth for him, and his soul mourneth over him' (ibid. v. 22)? And R. Isaac has said : The worm is as painful to the flesh of the dead as a needle in the flesh of the living !" Some answer : The dead know of their own troubles, but not of the troubles of others. 

Do they not [know of the troubles of others]? Lo, there is a teaching : It once happened that a pious man gave a denarius[5] to a beggar on the New Year's eve in a time of drought. His wife upbraided him ; so he went and spent the night in the cemetery[6]. He heard two spirits conversing. One said to the other, "Come, friend, let us wander in the world and hear behind the curtain[7] what visitation is to come upon the world." The other spirit replied, "I cannot, because I am buried in a matting of reeds[8]; but go thou and report to me what thou hearest." She[9] went, and having wandered about returned. The other asked, "What didst thou hear, friend, behind the curtain ?" She replied, "I heard that if one sows in the first rainfall[10], the hail will smite it." This man thereupon went and sowed in the second rainfall. [The hail] destroyed everybody's crops but not his. 

The following year, he again spent the [New Year's] night in the cemetery, and heard the same two spirits conversing. One said to the other, "Come, let us wander in the world and hear behind the curtain what visitation is to come upon the world." The other spirit replied, "Have I not told thee, friend, that I cannot, because I am buried in a matting of reeds? But go thou and come and tell me what thou hearest." She went, and wandered about and returned. The other spirit asked, "What didst thou hear behind the curtain ?" She replied, "I heard that if one sows in the second rainfall, it will be smitten by the blast." This man went and sowed in the first rainfall. What everybody else sowed was smitten by the blast, but not his. His wife asked him, "How is it that last year everybody's crop was destroyed by hail, but not thine ; and this year everybody's crop was blasted except thine ?" He told her the whole story. 

It is related that very soon afterwards a quarrel broke out between the wife of that pious man and the mother of the girl[1]. The former said to the other, "Come, I will show thee that thy daughter is buried in reed-matting." The following year the same man went and spent the [New Year's] night in the cemetery, and he heard those spirits conversing. One said, "Come, friend, let us wander in the world and hear behind the curtain what visitation is to befall the world." The other replied, "Leave me alone, friend ; what has passed between me and thee has been overheard by the living." Infer from this that the dead do know ! [No ;] it is possible that some other person[2] died and went and informed them. 

Come and hear : Ze'iri left a sum of money in charge of his landlady[3]. During the time he went to the school of his master and returned, she died. He followed her to the court of death[4] and asked her, "Where is the money?" She replied, "Go and take it from beneath the door-socket in such and such a place ; and tell my mother to send me my comb and tube of eye-paint[5] through so-and-so who will arrive here to-morrow," Conclude from this that the dead do know ! [No;] perhaps Dumah[1] informed [the dead] beforehand[2]. 

Come and hear : The father of Samuel was entrusted with some money belonging to orphans. At the time that he passed away, Samuel was not with him. People afterwards called him, "Son of the consumer of the orphans' money." He went after his father to the court of death and said to them[3], "I want Abba." They replied, "There are many of that name here." "I want Abba b. Abba." They answered, "There are also many of that name here." He said to them, "I want Abba b. Abba, the father of Samuel ; where is he?" They answered, "He has gone up to the heavenly seminary[4]." In the meantime he noticed Levi[5] who was seated apart. He asked him, "Why sittest thou apart? Why hast thou not gone up [to the heavenly seminary]?" He replied, "I was told, 'The number of years thou didst not attend the seminary of R. Aphes and didst grieve him on that account, we will not permit thee to ascend to the heavenly seminary'." In the meantime his father arrived ; and Samuel noticed that he wept and laughed. He said to him, " Why weepest thou?" He answered, "Because thou wilt soon come here." "And why dost thou laugh?" "Because thou art very highly thought of in this world." Samuel said to him, "If I am so esteemed, let them allow Levi to enter" ; and they permitted him to enter. He asked him, "Where is the orphans' money ?" He answered, "Go, take it from the enclosure of the mill. The upper and lower sums of money belong to us, the middle sum belongs to the orphans." He asked his father, "Why didst thou act in this manner?" He replied, "Should thieves come to steal, they would steal ours ; should the earth destroy[6], it would destroy ours." Conclude from this that the dead do know[7]! [No ;] perhaps it was different with Samuel ; being a man so highly esteemed, it may have been announced in advance "Make way for him." 

R. Jonathan likewise retracted[1]; for R. Samuel b. Nahmani said in the name of R. Jonathan : Whence do we learn that the dead converse one with the other? As it is said, "And the Lord said unto him[2], This is the land which I swore unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying" (Deut. xxxiv. 4). What means "saying"? The Holy One, blessed be He, spake to Moses, "Go, tell Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, The oath which I swore unto you have I fulfilled for your children." If thou shouldest imagine that [[fol. 19a.]] they were not cognisant [of what transpires on earth], what use would it be to tell them ? On the other hand, if they were cognisant, what need was there for him to inform them ? To give the credit to Moses.  

R. Isaac said : Whoever speaks [evil] of the dead is as though he spoke it of a stone. Some say that they are not aware [of what is spoken], while others say they are aware but it does not trouble them. But it is not so ! For Rab Pappa[3] spoke [evil] of Mar Samuel [after his death], and a pole fell from the roof and split his skull ! It is different with a Rabbinical scholar, because the Holy One, blessed be He, defends his honour. 

R. Joshua b. Levi said : Whoever talks [evil] after the bier of disciplas of the wise will fall into Gehinnom ; as it is said, "But as for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the Lord will lead them away with the workers of iniquity. Peace be upon Israel" (Ps. cxxv. 5) — i.e. even at a time when "there is peace upon Israel," "the Lord will lead them away with the workers of iniquity." 

It was taught by the school of R. Ishmael : If thou seest a scholar committing an offence at night, do not criticise him for it by day ; perhaps he has repented by then. Dost thou imagine perhaps he has repented? Nay, he has certainly repented. This refers[4] only to an offence concerned with his person ; but in a matter involving money, [he may be criticised] until he refunds it to its owner. 

R. Joshua b. Levi also said : In twenty-four places [it is taught] that the Bet Din excommunicates a man for [lack of] respect to a teacher, and we learn them all in our Mishnah[1]. R. Eleazar asked him : Where [are they to be found]? He replied : Search and thou wilt find them. He accordingly went and searched and found three — Who despises the washing of the hands[2], who talks [evil] after the bier of the disciples of the wise, and who acts arrogantly towards the Most High. "Who talks after the bier of disciples of the wise" ; where is this to be found ? There is a Mishnaic teaching : ['Akabya b. Mahalalel] used to say : We may not administer the waters of a woman suspected of adultery[3] to a female proselyte or freed woman ; but the Sages say : We may do so. And they said to him, "It happened with Karkemit, a freed handmaid of Jerusalem, and Shemayah and Abtalion did administer the waters to her!" 'Akabya said to them, "It was for show that they made her drink[4]." Thereupon the Sages excommunicated him and he died under the ban, and the Bet Din stoned his coffin. "Whoever despises the washing of the hands" ; where is this found ? There is a Mishnaic teaching : R. Judah said : God forbid that we should suppose that 'Akabya b. Mahalalel was excommunicated, for the Temple-court[5] was not locked upon any man of Israel equal to him in knowledge, purity and fear of sin. But who was it they excommunicated? It was Eleazar b. Hanok, because he made light of the washing of the hands ; and when he died the Bet Din sent and placed a large stone upon his coffin, to teach that whoever is excommunicated and dies under the ban, the Bet Din stones his coffin. "Who acts arrogantly towards the Most High" ; where is this to be found? There is a Mishnaic teaching : Simeon b. Shetah sent to Honi Hamme'aggel[6] : "Thou art deserving of excommunication, and wert thou not Honi, I would pronounce the ban against thee ; but what can I do seeing that thou art petulant with the Omnipresent, and nevertheless He fulfils thy desires as a father gratifies a petulant child ; and concerning thee the Scriptures state, 'Let thy father and thy mother be glad, and let her that bore thee rejoice ' (Prov. xxiii. 25)." Is there no other instance [of arrogance towards God]? Yes, there is; for Rab Joseph has taught[1] : Theodosius of Rome accustomed the Jews in Rome to eat kids roasted in their entirety[2] on the Passover niglit. They[3] sent him [the message] : "If thou wert not Theodosius, I would have issued a ban against thee, for thou hast induced Israelites to eat the holy things outside [Jerusalem][4]." But we are speaking of instances mentioned in our Mishnah ; and this is a Baraita ! Is there none in the Mishnah ? Yes, there is ; for there is a Mishnaic teaching : If one has cut [a portable earthenware oven] into layers and placed sand between each layer[5], R. Eliezer declares it clean, but the Sages declare it unclean ; and this is what is known as "the oven of the serpent[6]." Why "serpent"? Rab Judah said in the name of Samuel : This teaches that the Sages wound it round with discussions as a serpent [winds itself round something] and proved that the oven was unclean. And there is a teaching : That day they brought everything that R. Eliezer had proclaimed clean[7] and burnt it in his presence, and finally they excommunicated[8] him. Despite this, we have not learnt a case of excommunication in the Mishnah ! And where are the twenty-four places to be found[1]? R. Joshua b. Levi compares one thing with another[2], but R. Eleazar does not. 

The bearers of the bier and they who relieve them. 

Our Rabbis have taught : We should not carry out a body [for burial] near the time of reading the Shema'[3] ; but if they have commenced to do so, we should not stop them. But it is not so ' For lo, Rab Joseph was borne out near the time of reading the Shema' ! With a highly esteemed man it is different 

Such as are before the bier and stich as are behind it. 

Our Rabbis have taught : Those who are occupied with the funeral oration at the time when the body is lying before them should slip away one by one and read the Shema'; but if the body is not present, they sit and read the Shema' and the orator sits in silence ; they stand and say the Tefillah, and he justifies the divine decree, saying : "Lord of the Universe, I have often sinned before Thee, and Thou hast not exacted punishment from me for one in a thousand. May it be Thy will, O Lord our God, to repair our breaches and the breaches of all Thy people, the house of Israel, in mercy." Abbai said : A man ought not to speak thus ; for R. Simeon b. Lakish said, and it has been similarly taught in the name of R. Jose : A man should not open his mouth to Satan[4]. Rab Joseph said : What is the Scriptural authority for this ? As it is said, "We should have been as Sodom" (Is. i. 9) ; and what did the prophet reply to them? "Hear the word of the Lord, ye rulers of Sodom" (ibid. v. 10). 

Having buried the dead and returned, etc. 

If they are able to begin and finish the whole, yes ; but if only one paragraph or one verse, are they not [to commence it]? Against this conclusion I quote : Having buried the dead and returned, if they are able to begin and complete even one paragraph or one verse [they should commence it] ! Here likewise[5] it means that if they are able to begin and finish one paragraph or even one verse, before reaching the row, they should begin ; but if not, they should not commence it. 

As for those who stand in the row, etc. 

Our Rabbis have taught : The row which looks upon the inner [[fol. 19 b.]] space[1] is exempt [from reading the Shema']; but the row which does not look upon the inner space is under the obligation. R. Judah says : Those who come out of regard for the mourner are exempt ; but those who come on their own account[2] are under the obligation. 

Rab Judah said in the name of Rab : Who finds diverse kinds[3] in his garment must divest himself thereof even in the street. What is the reason ? [As it is said,] "There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the Lord" (Prov. xxi. 30) — i.e. wherever the Divine Name is liable to be profaned, we pay no respect to a teacher. Against this teaching is quoted : Having buried the dead, and on returning there are two paths before them one clean, the other unclean[4], if [the mourner] enters the clean path, they follow him there, and if he enters the unclean path, they follow him there out of respect for him[5]! Why should this be so? Let one say, "There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the Lord"! R. Abba explained that it speaks here of a Bet Peras[6] which is declared unclean by the Rabbis[7]. For Rab Judah said in the name of Samuel : One may blow upon a Bet Peras [to see whether there are any bones ; and if there are none] he may walk on it[8]. And Rab Judah b. Ashe said in the name of Rab[9] : A Bet Peras which has been much trodden under foot is to be regarded as clean. 

Come and hear : R. Eleazar b. Sadok[10] said : We used to leap upon the coffins of the dead to meet the kings of Israel[11], and not only to meet kings of Israel do they so permit, but even to meet the kings of other nations[1] ; for if he be worthy, he will discern between the kings of Israel and the kings of other nations. Why should this be so? Let one say, "There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the Lord" ! It is in accord with the opinion of Raba[2], who said : According to the teaching of the Torah, "a tent" — i.e. anything which contains a hollow space at least a handbreadth in extent — forms a partition against uncleanness, but if it does not contain a hollow space at least a handbreadth in extent it does not form such a partition ; and most coffins have a hollow space a handbreadth in extent. But the Rabbis decreed that even those which have this hollow space [should defile] because of those which have it not ; but for the purpose of paying honour to royalty, the Rabbis do not enforce this decree. 

Come and hear : Great is the duty of honouring one's fellow-creatures, since it sets aside a prohibition enjoined by the Torah. Why should this be so? Let one say, "There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the Lord" ! Rab b. Shaba explained it in the presence of Rab Kahana as referring to the prohibition, "Thou shalt not turn aside from the sentence which they shall declare unto thee" (Deut. xvii. 11). They laughed at him, for is not the prohibition, "Thou shalt not turn aside" enjoined by the Torah" ! Rab Kahana said to them : A great man having expressed an opinion, you should not laugh at him. We base the authority for all the dicta of the Rabbis upon the prohibition, "Thou shalt not turn aside" ; but for the duty of honouring a fellow-creature the Rabbis give permission[4]. 

Come and hear: [It is written :] "And hide thyself from them" (ibid. xxii. 1)[5]; i.e. there are times when thou mayest hide thyself from them, and times when thou must not hide thyself from them. 

How can this be? If he was a Kohen[1] and [the straying animal] was in a cemetery ; or he was an Elder and it was derogatory to his dignity [to be seen leading the animal back] ; or his work was more important than his neighbour's[2] — therefore it is said, "And hide thyself." Why should this be so ? Let one say, "There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the Lord[3]"! It is different here ; for it is written, "And hide thyself from them[4]." May one, then, conclude from this[5]? We cannot draw an inference about a prohibition from a case involving only financial loss[6]. 

Come and hear: [It is written,] "Or for his sister" (Num. vi. 7)[7]. What has this teaching to tell us ? Supposing he[8] were on his way to sacrifice the Paschal lamb or circumcise his son[9], and he heard that one of his relatives had died, it is possible [to think] that he should turn back and render himself unclean ; say, then, he shall not make himself unclean. It is possible [to think] that in the same way that [under these conditions] he may not make himself unclean for his relatives, he may not make himself unclean for a Met Miswah, therefore there is a teaching to tell us "or for his sister" ; i.e. "for his sister" he may not render himself unclean, but for a Met Miswah he must defile himself. Why should this [[fol. 20 a.]] be so? Let one say, "There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the Lord[1]"! It is different here; because it is written "for his sister[2]." May one, then, conclude from this ? Sit and do nothing is different[3]. 

Rab Pappa asked Abbai : How were our predecessors different from us that miracles occurred for them but not for us? Is it a question of learning ? In the time of Rab Judah, their whole study was limited to the Order "Damages[4]," whereas we study the six Orders; and when Rab Judah reached the paragraph in Mishnah 'Uksin[5] : "If a woman presses vegetables in a pot" (some declare it was the paragraph : "Olives which are pressed with their leaves are clean"), he said, "We see here the conflicts of Rab and Samuel[6]," whereas we study 'Uksin in thirteen lessons[7] ! Yet, with respect to Rab Judah, when he took off one of his shoes[8], the rain descended ; but we afflict our souls and cry aloud and there is none that takes notice of us ! He replied : Our predecessors jeopardised their lives for the sanctification of the Name, but we do not. As it once happened with Rab Adda b. Ahabah who noticed a heathen woman[9] wearing a karbalta[10] in the street; thinking that she was an Israelite, he went up to her and tore it from off her. It was then discovered that she was a heathen, and they fined him four hundred Zuzim. He said to her, "What is thy name ?" She replied, "Matun." He said, "Matun, Matun, is worth four hundred Zuzim[1]." 

Rah Giddel had the habit of going and sitting at the gate of the baths[2], saying [to the women as they entered], "Bathe thus and thus." The Rabbis said to him, "Is not the master afraid of [the promptings of] the evil impulse ?" He replied, "They are in my eyes like white geese." 

R. Johanan had the habit of going and sitting at the gates of the baths, saying, "When the daughters of Israel leave, let them gaze upon me, and they will have children as beautiful as I[3]." The Rabbis said to him, "Art thou not afraid of the Evil Eye[4]?" He answered, "I am come from the seed of Joseph against whom the Evil Eye had no power ; for it is written, 'Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine by a fountain' (Gen. xlix. 22) ; and R. Abbahu said: Read not 'ale 'ayin 'by a fountain' but 'ole 'ayin 'overcoming the [Evil] Eye'." R. Jose b. Hannina said : From the following passage [did R. Johanan derive his reason] : "And let them grow [weyidgu] into a multitude in the midst of the earth" (ibid. xlviii. 16) ; i.e. as the fishes [dagim] in the sea are covered by the water and the Evil Eye has no power over them, in similar manner the Evil Eye has no power over the seed of Joseph. Or if thou wilt, say that the eye which desired not to partake of what did not belong to it[5] cannot be influenced by the Evil Eye. 

MISHNAH III 

Women, slaves and minors are exempt from reading the Shema' and from Tefillin; but they are under the obligation of Tefillah, [[fol. 20 b.]] Mezuzah and Grace after meals. 

GEMARA 

Why are the reading of the Shema' and Tefillin different [from the others] ? Because they are commands[1] the observance of which depends upon a certain point of time, and women are exempt from all commands of this class. Tefillah, Mezuzah and Grace after meals, being commands the observance of which does not depend upon a certain point of time, are obligatory upon women[2]. 

That the reading of the Shema' [is not obligatory upon women] is self-evident, because it is a command the observance of which depends upon a certain point of time, and women are exempt from all commands of this class! [Why, then, does the Mishnah mention it ?] Thou mightest say that since it contains a reference to the Kingdom of Heaven [it should be read by women] ; therefore it informs us [they are exempt]. 

And from Tefillin. This too is evident ! Thou mightest say that since Tefillin are to be compared with Mezuzah[3] [they should be obligatory upon women] ; therefore it informs us [they are exempt]. 

But they are under the obligation of Tefillah ; [obviously] because this is prayer! But thou mightest say that since it is written thereby, "Evening and morning and at noonday" (Ps. lv. 18), it is like a command the observance of which depends upon a certain point of time [and women are exempt]; therefore it informs us [the obligation is theirs]. 

And Mezuzah. This is evident ! But thou mightest say that since it is to be compared with the study of Torah[4], [being exempt from the latter they are likewise exempt from the former] ; therefore it informs us [that women have the duty of fixing the Mezuzah]. 

And Grace after meals. This too is evident ! But thou mightest say that since it is written thereby, "When the Lord shall give you in the evening flesh to eat and in the morning bread to the full" (Exod. xvi. 8), it is like a command the observance of which depends upon a certain point of time [and women are exempt]; therefore it informs us [that it is obligatory]. 

Rab Adda b. Ahabah said : Women are under the obligation to recite the Sanctitication [1] of the [Sabbath] day by the ordinance of the Torah. But why, since it is a command the observance of which is dependent upon a certain point of time, and women are exempt from all commands of this class ! Abbai answered : [The Sanctification by women] is a Rabbinical ordinance. Rab said to him : But lo, [Rab Adda] mentioned it was "by the ordinance of the Torah" ! And further, let us make all commands [of this class] obligatory upon women by Rabbinic authority ! But, said Raba, [the correct reason why they have to "sanctify" the Sabbath is because] the Scriptures declare, "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy" (Exod. xx. 8) and "Observe the Sabbath to keep it holy" (Deut. v. 12) — everyone who has to "observe[2]" must likewise "remember[3]"; and since women must "observe," so must they "remember." 

Rabina asked Raba : Is the recital of the Grace after meals by women an ordinance from the Torah or the Rabbis ? What is the point at issue ? It is whether they have the power of exempting others[4]. It is quite right if thou sayest it is from the Torah ; then one who is enjoined by the Torah [to keep the observance] comes and exempts one [whose observance is likewise commanded] by the Torah. But if thou sayest it is from the Rabbis, then it is not a compulsory observance, and one who is not under the obligation [to keep the observance] cannot exempt others. How is it then ? Come and hear : It has indeed been stated : A son [who is a minor] may say Grace for his father, a slave for his master, and a woman for her husband ; but the Sages declare : May a curse alight upon the man for whom his wife or his son says Grace ! This[5] is quite right if thou sayest that it is from the Torah; then one who is enjoined by the Torah [to keep the observance] comes and exempts one [whose observance is likewise commanded] by the Torah. But if thou sayest it is from the Rabbis, then one who is enjoined by the Rabbis [to keep the observance] comes and exempts one [whose observance is commanded] by the Torah ! Also, according to thy reason, is a minor under the obligation [to say Grace][6] ? Nay, with what case are we here dealing ? With one who, for instance, has eaten the minimum quantity ordained by the Rabbis [as making the saying of Grace necessary][1] ; and thus one who is enjoined by the Rabbis [to say Grace][2] comes and exempts one [whose observance is likewise commanded] by the Rabbis[3]. 

Rab 'Awira expounded (sometimes he said it in the name of R. Ammi and sometimes in the name of R. Assi) : The ministering angels spake before the Holy One, blessed be He, "Lord of the universe ! It is written of Thee in Thy Torah, 'Who regardeth not persons[4] nor taketh reward' (Deut. x. 17); but dost Thou not regard the person of Israel, for it is written, 'The Lord lift up His countenance upon thee' (Num. vi. 26)?" He replied to them, "And should I not regard the person of Israel, for whom I wrote in the Torah, 'And thou shalt eat and be satisfied and bless the Lord thy God' (Deut. viii. 10), but they are strict with themselves [and bless] even with a quantity of food equal in size to an olive or an egg?" 

MISHNAH IV 

A Ba'al Keri meditates upon [the wording of the Shema'] in his heart and says neither the benediction before nor after[5]. At his meal, he says the Grace after [in his heart] but not the Grace before. R. Judah declares : He says Grace before and after. 

GEMARA 

Rabina said : [The statement of the Mishnah] means to say that meditation is the equivalent of speech ; for if it enter thy mind that it is not the equivalent of speech, why should he meditate! How is it then? Meditation is the equivalent of speech. Let him, then, utter the words with his lips ! No ; it is as we find at Mount Sinai[6]. 

But Rab Hisda said : Meditation is not the equivalent of speech ; for if it enter thy mind that it is the equivalent of speech, let him utter the words with his lips ! How is it then ? Meditation is not the equivalent of speech. Why, then, should he meditate? R. Eleazar said : So that the whole world should not be engaged upon the reading of the Shema', whereas he sits idle. Then let him read some other chapter ! Rab Adda b. Ahabah replied : With that wherewith the Community is engaged [should he like-wise be engaged]. But Tefillah is also a matter with which the [[fol. 21 a.]] Community is engaged, and there is a Mishnaic teaching: If he was standing in the Tefillah and recollected that he is a Ba'al Keri, he should not interrupt [his prayer] but shorten it[1]. The reason is because he had already commenced it ; hence, if he had not commenced it, he should not do so ! It is different with Tefillah, because it contains no reference to the Kingdom of Heaven. But in the Grace after meals there is also no reference to the Kingdom of Heaven, and yet our Mishnah declares : At his meal, he says the Grace after but not the Grace before ! Quite so ; but the reading of the Shema' and the Grace after meals are ordained by the Torah, whereas Tefillah is ordained by the Rabbis. 

Rab Judah said[2] : Whence is it that Grace after meals is ordained by the Torah? As it is said, "And thou shalt eat and be satisfied and bless the Lord thy God" (Deut. viii. 10). Whence is it that the benediction to be uttered before reading the Torah is ordained by the Torah[3]? As it is said, "For I will proclaim the name of the Lord : ascribe ye greatness unto our God" (ibid. xxxii. 3)[4]. 

R. Johanan said : We derive the injunction to utter a benediction after reading the Torah from the Grace after meals by a fortiori argument, and the injunction to say Grace before meaLs meals from the benediction over the reading of the Torah by a similar method of reasoning. We derive the injunction to utter a benediction after reading the Torah from the Grace after meals by a fortiori argument : If a meal which requires no benediction before it requires one after it, is it not right that the reading of the Torah, which does require a benediction before it, should require one after it ! And we derive the injunction to say Grace after meals from the benediction over the reading of the Torah by a similar method of reasoning : If the reading of the Torah, which requires no benediction after it[1], requires one before it, is it not right that a meal, which does require a benediction after it, should require one before it ! One can, however, object to this reasoning : Why is Grace answered squired after a meal? Because it has been enjoyed[2]. Why is a benediction required over the reading of the Torah ? Because it is life eternal. Moreover there is a teaching in our Mishnah: At his meal, he says the Grace after but not the Grace before ! The refutation [remains unanswered]. 

Rab Judah said[3] : If one is in doubt whether he has read the Shema' or not, he does not repeat it ; if he is in doubt whether he said "True and firm[4]" or not, he does repeat it. What is the reason ? Because the reading of the Shema' is ordained by the Rabbis, but saying "True and firm" by the Torah. Rab Joseph quoted in objection : "When thou liest down and when thou risest up" (Deut. vi. 7)[5]! Abbai answered him: That is written with reference to words of Torah[6]. We have a teaching in our Mishnah : A Ba'al Keri meditates upon [the wording of the Shema'] in his heart and says neither the benediction before nor after. At his meal, he says the Grace after [in his heart] but not the Grace before. But if it enter thy mind that "True and firm" is ordained by the Torah, then he should say the benediction after the Shema' ! And for what reason should he say this benediction ? If because it contains a reference to the Exodus from Egypt[7], he has already mentioned that in the Shema'[8] ! Then let him say this benediction and there will be no necessity for the other[9] ! The reading of the Shema' is more important because it contains two things[10]. 

R. Eleazar said : If one is in doubt whether he has read the Shema' or not, he should repeat it ; but if he is in doubt whether he has said the Tefillah or not, he need not repeat it. But R. Johanan said: Would that a man could pray all day[1]. 

Rab Judah also said in the name of Samuel : If a man was standing in the Tefillah and recollected that he had already said it, he must stop even in the middle of a benediction. But it is not so ! For lo, Rab Nahman has said : When we were at the school of Rabbah b. Abbuha we asked him, "How is it with those youug disciples who made a mistake and said the week-day Tefillah on the Sabbath, should they finish it[2]?" And he replied, "They should finish the whole of that benediction[3]" ! Now is this analogy correct? In the latter instance[4], he was at any rate under the obligation [to say the Tefillah] and the Rabbis did not trouble him out of regard for the Sabbath ; but in the former case[5], he had already said the prayer. 

Rab Judah also said in the name of Samuel : Should one have already said the Tefillah and then enter a Synagogue and find the Congregation saying it, if he is able to add anything new to the prayer, he may repeat it ; but if not, he should not repeat it. It was necessary [to have both this and the former teaching of Rab Judah in the name of Samuel] ; for if he had given us only the first teaching, [we might have argued,] To whom does this apply ? To a person who said the Tefillah alone and is repeating it alone ; or to a person who said the Tefillah with the Congregation and [[fol. 21 b.]] is repeating it with the Congregation ; but having said it alone, he is like one who has not prayed when he finds himself with a Congregation ! Therefore he informs us [that having once said the Tefillah in private, there is no need to say it a second time with a Congregation], And if he had only given us the latter teaching, [we might have supposed that he does not say the Tefillah a second time with the Congregation] because he has not actually commenced it; but in the former circumstance[6], having commenced it, therefore he should not [interrupt it on discovering his error] ! Consequently it was necessary [to have the first teaching of Rab Judah][1].
 
Rab Huna said : Should one enter a Synagogue and find the Congregation saying the Tefillah, if he is able to commence and finish before the Precentor reaches the words "We give thanks unto Thee[2]," he should say the Tefillah; but if not, he should not say it[3]. R. Joshua b. Levi said : If he is able to commence and finish before the Precentor reaches the "Sanctification[4]," he should say the Tefillah ; but if not, he should not say it. In what do they differ ? The former is of the opinion that the individual says the "Sanctification[5]," whereas the other is of the opinion that the individual does not say it[6]. And similarly said Rab Adda b. Ahabah : Whence is it that the individual does not say the "Sanctification"? As it is said, "But I will be hallowed among the children of Israel" (Lev. xxii. 32) — i.e. anything which comes under the heading of "Sanctification" cannot be without a minimum of ten. How is this implied ? As Rabbanai, the brother of R. Hiyya b. Abba, taught : We draw an analogy from the occurrence of the word "among[7]." It is written here, "But I will be hallowed among the children of Israel" and it is written elsewhere "Separate yourselves from among this congregation" (Num. xvi. 21). As in the latter circumstance there were ten[8], so here also there must be ten. But everybody agrees that a man must not interrupt [the Tefillah in order to make the responses to the "Sanctification" or "We give thanks"]. The question was raised : May one interrupt [the Tefillah] to respond, "Let His great name be blessed[9]"? When Rab Dimai came [from Palestine] he reported that R. Judah and R. Simeon[1], disciples of R. Johanan, said: For no response may we interrupt [the Tefillah] except for "Let His great name be blessed"; for even one engaged with the study of the Ma'aseh Merkabah[2] must interrupt [to make this response]. But the Halakah is not in accord with their view. 

R. Judah declares : He says Grace before and after. 

That is to say that R. Judah is of the opinion that a Ba'al Keri is permitted to study Torah[3]. But lo, R. Joshua b. Levi has said : Whence is it that a Ba'al Keri is forbidden to study Torah? As it is said, "Thou shalt make them known unto thy children and thy children's children" (Deut. iv. 9) and it continues, "The day that thou stoodest before the Lord thy God in Horeb" (ibid. v. 10) — as those who were Ba'al Keri were forbidden [in the assembly at Horeb][4], so are they forbidden [to occupy themselves with Torah]. Shouldest thou say that R. Judah does not draw deductions from juxtaposition[5], but Rab Joseph has said : Even one who does not draw deductions from juxtaposition in any other part of the Torah does so in the Book of Deuteronomy; and R. Judah who does not draw deductions from juxtaposition in any other part of the Torah does so in the Book of Deuteronomy. 

How do we know that he does not use this method in any other part of the Torah ? For there is a teaching : Ben 'Azzai said : It is stated, "Thou shalt not suffer a sorceress to live" (Exod. xxii. 17)[6] and it continues, "Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death" (ibid. v. 18); [the Rabbis] connect the two laws to infer that as the one who lieth with a beast is put to death by stoning[7], so also is the sorceress put to death by stoning. R. Judah said to him : Because the two matters are in juxtaposition, shall we inflict stoning upon the person [condemned for sorcery[8]] ! [No;] but they that divine by a ghost or a familiar spirit come under the category of sorcerers; and why are they particularised[1]? To draw an analogy and teach thee that as these are punished by stoning, so also is the sorceress[2]. 

How do we know that R. Judah does draw deductions from juxta-position in the Book of Deuteronomy? For there is a teaching[3]: R. Eliezer says : A man may marry one outraged or seduced by his father, or one outraged or seduced by his son. R. Judah prohibits a man to marry one outraged or seduced by his father. Rab Giddel asked in the name of Rab : What is R. Judah 's reason? Because it is written, "A man shall not take his father's wife and shall not uncover his father's skirt" (Deut. xxiii. 1) — i.e. the skirt which his father had seen shall he not uncover. But how do we know that this refers to one outraged by his father ? Because it is written in the preceding verse, "The man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel's father fifty shekels of silver" (ibid. xxii. 29). They said : Yes, in the Book of Deuteronomy R. Judah does use this method of deduction[4]; but the consecutive verses [quoted above] are required for another teaching of R. Joshua b. Levi who says : Whoever teaches his son Torah, the Scriptures ascribe it to him as though he had received it from Mount Horeb ; as it is said, "Thou shalt make them known unto thy children and thy children's children" (Deut. iv. 9) and it continues, "The day that thou stoodest before the Lord thy God in Horeb" (ibid. v. 10)[5]. 

There is a Mishnaic teaching : A man with a running issue who has experienced emission, a menstruous woman from whom the semen has escaped and a woman who during intercourse experiences the menstrual flow require immersion[6] ; but R. Judah exempts them therefrom. Only in the case of a roan with a running issue who has experienced emission does R. Judah grant exemption, because he was not originally under the obligation to bathe ; but [it may be argued] a man who is merely a Ba'al Keri he does compel [to have immersion][1]. And shouldest thou say that in fact R. Judah even exempts a mere Ba'al Keri, and the point of variance [between him and the Rabbis] is the man with a running issue who experienced emission, to show thee the extreme view taken by the Rabbis[2], I then quote the latter part of the Mishnaic teaching : "A woman who during intercourse experiences the menstrual flow requires immersion." For whom does he mention this ? If it is supposed for the Rabbis, it is surely obvious ; since if a man with a running issue who experiences emission and originally was not under the necessity of bathing is compelled by the Rabbis to have immersion, how much more so a woman who experiences the menstrual flow during intercourse and originally was under the necessity of bathing ! Must it not be for R. Judah ? But the statement is intended to apply to this case exclusively, viz. : a woman who experienced the menstrual flow during intercourse [[fol. 22a.]] does not require immersion ; but a mere Ba'al Keri he does place under the obligation[3]. 

Do not read He says Grace but He meditates[4]. But does R. Judah hold that meditation [is sufficient] ? For lo, there is a teaching : A Ba'al Keri who has no water in which to bathe should read the Shema', but without the benediction before and after ; and he eats his meal with Grace after but not before, but he meditates [upon the Grace before meals] in his heart without uttering it with his lips. These are the words of R. Meir ; but R. Judah says : He should utter them both[5]! Rab Nahman b. Isaac said : R. Judah treats the Grace before and after meals like the Halakot of Derek Eres[6]; for there is a teaching: "Thou shalt make them known unto thy children and thy children's children" (Deut. iv. 9) and it continues, "The day that thou stoodest before the Lord thy God in Horeb" (Deut. iv. 10) — as [the Israelites stood at Horeb] with dread and fear aod trembling and shaking, so here [when teaching Torah] must it be with dread and fear and trembling and shaking. Hence [the Rabbis] said : Men with a running issue, lepers and those who have had intercourse with menstruous women are permitted to read the Pentateuch, the Prophets and the Hagiographa[1], to study Mishnah, Midrash[2], Talmud, Halakot and Aggadot ; but those who are Ba'al Keri are forbidden[3]. R. Jose says : The Ba'al Keri may study what is familiar to him[4], but he must not expound the Mishnah. R. Jonathan b. Joseph says : He may expound the Mishnah but not the Talmud. R. Nathan b. Abishalom says : Also the Talmud may he expound, but he must not pronounce the name of God when it occurs[5]. R. Johanan the Sandal-maker, disciple of R.'Akiba, said in the name of R.'Akiba : Such a man should not enter upon study at all. Another version of this statement is : Such a man should not enter a House of Study at all. R. Judah says : He may study the Halakot of Derek Eres. 

It once happened that R. Judah, who had experienced emission, was walking by the river, and his disciples said to him, "Master, teach us a chapter of the Halakot of Derek Eres[6]." He descended into the water, bathed, and then taught them. They said to him, "Hast thou not taught us. Master, that such an one may study the Halakot of Derek Eres?" He replied, "Although I am lenient by permitting others, I take a stricter view with myself." 

There is a teaching : R. Judah b. Batyra used to say : The words of Torah do not contract defilement[7]. It happened that a disciple was speaking indistinctly over against R. Judah b. Batyra[8]. He said to him : My son, open thy mouth and let thy words issue forth clearly, because words of Torah cannot contract defilement; as it is said, "Is not My word like a fire? saith the Lord" (Jer. xxiii 29) — as fire does not contract defilement, so also words of Torah do not contract defilement. 

The teacher stated above : "He may expound the Mishnah but not the Talmud." This supports the statement of R. El'ai, for R. El'ai declared that Rab Aha b. Jacob[1] said in the name of our master[2] : The Halakah is that he may expound the Mishnah but not the Talmud. This is as the Tannaim [taught] : He may expound the Mishnah but not the Talmud ; these are the words of R. Meir. R. Judah b. Gamaliel says in the name of R. Hannina b. Gamaliel : Both of them are forbidden ; but [the Rabbis] said to him : Both of them are permitted. He who says both are forbidden agrees with R. Johanan the Sandal-maker; and he who says both are permitted agrees with R. Judah b. Batyra. 

Rab Nahman b. Isaac said : The world acts in conformity with the following three Elders[3]: according to R. El'ai in the matter of the first-shorn wool[4]; according to R. Josiah in the matter of diverse seeds ; according to R. Judah b. Batyra in the matter of words of Torah. According to R. El'ai in the matter of the firstshorn wool — for there is a teaching : R. El'ai says : The law of the first-shorn wool applies only in the [Holy] Land. According to R. Josiah in the matter of diverse seeds — for there is a teaching[5]: R. Josiah says : A man is not guilty [of the infraction of this law] until he sows wheat, barley and kernels with one throw of the hand. According to R. Judah b. Batyra in the matter of words of Torah — for there is a teaching : R. Judah b. Batyra says : Words of Torah cannot contract defilement. When Ze'iri came [from Palestine] he said : The Rabbis have abolished immersion[6]. Another version is : [he said :] The Rabbis have abolished the washing of the hands. He who says, "The Rabbis have abolished immersion" agrees with the view of R. Judah b. Batyra. He who says, "The Rabbis have abolished the washing of the hands" is in accord with Rab Hisda who cursed the man who went looking for water at the time of prayer[7]. 

Our Rabbis have taught : A Ba'al Keri upon whom nine Kabs of water have been poured becomes clean. Nahum, the man of  Gam Zu[1], whispered this to R. 'Akiba, who whispered it to Ben 'Azzai. Ben 'Azzai went out and taught it to his disciples publicly. Two Palestinian Amoraim, R. Jose b. Abin and R. Jose b. Zebida, differ on this matter ; one stating that Ben 'Azzai taught it, the other that he whispered it. He who states that he taught it, because of the nullifying of Torah and procreation[2] ; he who states that he whispered it, so that disciples of the wise should not be constantly found in the company of their wives like cocks [with the hens][3]. 

R. Jannai said : I have heard that some take a lenient view[4] and others a stricter view ; but whoever applies the stricter rule to himself, his days and years will be prolonged for him. 

R. Joshua b. Levi said : What is the purpose of those [who are Ba'al Keri] who bathe in the morning ? What is their purpose ! And it was he who said that a Ba'al Keri is forbidden to be engaged with words of Torah[5] ! Nay, this is what he means to say : What is their purpose in using forty Saot of water, when it is possible [to become clean] with nine Kabs? What is their purpose in undergoing complete immersion when it is possible [to become clean] with water poured over one ? R. Hannina replied : They have erected a great fence[6] thereby; for there is a teaching : Once a man solicited a woman for an immoral purpose, and she said to him, "Thou good-for-nothing[7]! Hast thou forty Saot of water in which to immerse?" He immediately left her. 

Rab Huna said to the Rabbis, "My masters, why do you make light of this immersion[8]? Is it because of the cold ? It is possible [to fulfil the requirements] in the baths[9]!" Rab Hisda asked him, "Is it then right to have immersion in warm water ?" He replied, "Rab Adda b. Ahabah is of the same opinion as thou[1]." 

R. Zera was sitting in a tub in a bath-house. He said to his attendant, "Go, bring me nine Kabs of water and dash them over me." R. Hiyya b. Abba[2] said to him, "Why does the master require all that when he is sitting in the midst of water ?" He replied, "It is like the regulation of forty Saot. Just as forty Saot are necessary for immersion but not pouring, so are nine Kabs necessary for pouring but not immersion." 

Rab Nahman ordered a pitcher of the capacity of nine Kabs[3]. When Rab Dimai came [from Palestine], he said : R. 'Akiba and R. Judah the locksmith[4] declared : The teaching [that nine Kabs may be poured over a Ba'al Keri to cleanse him] is meant to apply only to a delicate person who experienced the emission involuntarily ; but for a delicate person who caused it to happen, forty Saot are necessary. Rab Joseph said : Rab Nahman's pitcher is broken[5]. When Rabin came he said : Such a case happened in Usha[6] in the ante-room of R. Osha'ya, and they came and consulted [[fol. 22 b.]]  Rab Assi[7]. He said to them : The teaching [about the nine Kabs] was meant to apply only to a delicate person who caused it to happen ; but the delicate person who experienced it involuntarily was exempt therefrom altogether. Rab Joseph said ; Rab Nahman's pitcher is repaired[8]. 

Note that all the Amoraim and Tannaim are at variance over the ordinance of Ezra, so let us see how Ezra ordained it. Abbai said : Ezra ordained forty Saot for a healthy person whose emission was voluntary and nine Kabs for a healthy person when it was involuntary. Then came the Amoraim and differed as to a person indelicate health[1]. Some were of the opinion that the delicate person whose emission was voluntary is like the healthy man whose emission was voluntary [and requires forty Saot], and the delicate person when it was involuntary like the healthy man when it was involuntary [and requires nine Kabs]. Others, however, were of opinion that the delicate person whose emission was voluntary is like a healthy man whose emission was involuntary [and requires nine Kabs], and the delicate person when it was involuntary is exempt therefrom altogether. 

Raba said : Granted that Ezra instituted immersion ; did he, then, institute the pouring of water? For lo, the teacher said, "Ezra instituted immersion for those who are Ba'al Keri[2]" ! But, said Raba, Ezra instituted immersion in forty Saot for a healthy person whose emission was voluntary, and then the Rabbis came and instituted [the pouring of] nine Kabs for a healthy man when it was involuntary. After that the Amoraim[3] came and differed as to what was to be done to a person in delicate health. Some were of opinion that the delicate person whose emission was voluntary was like a healthy man when it was voluntary [and required immersion], and a delicate person when it was involuntary like a healthy person when it was involuntary [and required pouring]. Others, however, were of opinion that the healthy person when it was voluntary required forty Saot ; and the delicate person when it was voluntary, like the healthy man when it was involuntary, required nine Kabs; but a delicate person whose emission was involuntary was exempt therefrom altogether.
 
Raba said : The Halakah is — Both the healthy man and the delicate person when it is voluntary require forty Saot ; the healthy man when it is involuntary requires nine Kabs; but the delicate person when it is involuntary is exempt therefrom altogether. 

Our Rabbis have taught: A Ba'al Keri upon whom nine Kabs of water have been poured becomes clean. Of what does this speak ? [If he wishes to study Torah] for himself; but [if he wishes to teach it] to others, forty Saot are necessary. R. Judah says that in every case forty Saot [are required]. R. Johanan and R. Joshua b. Levi, and R. Eleazar[1] and R. Jose b. R. Hannina—one of the first pair is at variance with one of the second pair on the interpretation of the first part of this teaching. One says : The statement, "Of what does this speak? [If he wishes to study Torah] for himself; but [if he wishes to teach it] to others, forty Saot are necessary" is intended to apply only to a delicate person whose emission was voluntary, but nine Kabs suffice him when it was involuntary. The other says : Whoever [wishes to teach Torah] to others, even if he be a delicate person whose emission was involuntary, [cannot be regarded as clean] until there have been forty Saot. And one of the first pair is at variance with one of the second pair on the latter part of the teaching. One says : The statement, "R. Judah says that in every case forty Saot are required" is intended to apply only [to water found] in the ground[2], but not [to water] in vessels[3]. The other says : It applies even [to water] in vessels. It is quite right for him who says, "It applies even [to water] in vessels," for that is what has been stated, viz. : "R. Judah says that in every case forty Saot are required" ; but for him who says, "In the ground, yes, but in vessels, no," what does the phrase "in every case" include? It is to include drawn water[4]. 

Rab Pappa and Rab Huna b. R. Joshua and Raba b. Samuel dined together. Rab Pappa said to them, "Permit me to say Grace[5], because nine Kabs have been poured over me." Raba b. R. Samuel said to them, "We have learnt: 'Of what does this speak? [If he wishes to study Torah] for himself [nine Kabs are sufficient] ; but [if he wishes to teach it] to others, forty Saot are necessary[6].' So permit me to say Grace, because forty Saot have been poured over me" [by means of immersion]. Rab Huna said to them, "Permit me to say Grace, since I have had need neither of the one nor the other." Rab Hamma used to bathe on the day preceding Passover[7] in order to exempt others from their obligation. But the Halakah is not in accord with their view[8]. 

MISHNAH V 

If he was standing in the Tefillah and recollects that he is a Ba'al Keri, he should not interrupt [his prayer] but shorten it. If he had gone doirn to bathe, should he have time to ascend, clothe himself and read [the Shema'] before sunrise, he must ascend, clothe himself and read ; but if not, he should immerse his body in the water and read. He may not immerse himself in evil-smelling water, nor water of soaking[1], until he has poured [fresh] water therein. To what distance must he remoce himself from it[2] and excrement [if he wishes to read the Shema'] ? Four cubits. 

GEMARA 

Our Rabbis have taught : If a man was standing in the Tefillah and recollects that he is a Ba'al Keri, he should not interrupt [his prayer] but shorten it. If he was reading in the Torah[3] and recollects that he is a Ba'al Keri, he should not interrupt and go away, but should continue reading with hurried pronunciation of the words. R. Meir says : A Ba'al Keri is not permitted to read more than three verses in the Torah. 

There is another teaching : If a man was standing in the Tefillah and saw some excrement opposite him, he should step forward until he has left it behind him a distance of four cubits. There is, however, a teaching [that in these circumstances he should step] sideways! There is no contradiction; [he should step forward] when that is possible, and [sideways] when he cannot do the other. If a man was reciting the Tefillah and found excrement where he was standing, Rabbah said : Even if he himself was responsible for it, his Tefillah is valid. Raba retorted : But lo [it is written], "The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination" (Prov. xxi. 27)! Therefore, said Raba, since he is responsible [for the excrement], although he has uttered the prayer, his Tefillah is an abomination[4]. 

Our Rabbis have taught : If he was standing in the Tefillah and the urine began to drip upon his knees, he should interrupt [his prayer] until it ceases and then repeat the Tefillah. To what point does he return? Rab Hisda and Rab Hamnuna [differ]. One says that he recommences from the beginning; the other says that he goes back only to the place where he stopped. One may suppose that the following is the point of divergence : One is of opinion [[fol. 23 a.]] that if the man has waited sufficient time to finish the remainder of the Tefillah, he should recommence from the beginning. The other is of opinion that [in any event] he should go back only to the point where he stopped. Rab Ashe said : The phrase "If the man has waited" must be altered to "If the man has not waited"; because everybody agrees that if he waited sufficient time to finish the remainder of the Tefillah, he recommences from the beginning; but the point of divergence there [between Rab Hisda and Rab Hamnuna] is the case where the man did not wait. One is of the opinion that the man was in an uncomfortable state and unfit [to pray], and therefore his Tefillah is invalid; while the other is of opinion that the man was fit [to pray] and his Tefillah is valid. 

Our Rabbis have taught : If a man feels the need to relieve himself, he should not say the Tefillah; and if he does, his prayer is an abomination. Rab Zebid (another version : Rab Judah) said : This teaching is meant to apply only to one who is unable to contain himself; but if he is able to contain himself, his Tefillah is valid. But for how long [must one be able to contain himself before venturing to say the Tefillah]? Rab Sheshet said : [Sufficient time to enable one to walk] a Parsah. There are some who make [this statement of Rab Zebid] a part of the Baraita [quoted above ; thus :] Of what does this speak[1]? Of a case where a man is unable to contain himself; but if he is able to contain himself, his Tefillah is valid. But for how long [must one be able to contain himself before venturing to say the Tefillah]? Rab Zebid said : [Sufficient time to enable one to walk] a Parsah. 

R. Samuel b. Nahmani said in the name of R. Jonathan : If a man feels the need to relieve himself, he should not say the Tefillah; because it is said, "Prepare to meet thy God, O Israel" (Amos iv. 12). 

R. Samuel b. Nahmani also said in the name of R. Jonathan : What means that which is written, "Guard thy foot when thou goest to the house of God" (Eccles. iv. 17)? Guard thyself so that thou sinnest not; but if thou sinnest, bring an offering into My presence. "And be ready to hearken " (Eccles. iv. 1 7) — Raba said : Be ready to hearken to the words of the Sages ; for if they sin, they bring an offering and repent. "It is better than when fools give sacrifices" (ibid.) — be not like the fools who sin and bring an offering without repenting. "For they know not to do evil " (ibid.)[1] — if so, they are righteous ! Nay, [the meaning is :] Be not like the fools who sin and bring an offering and know not whether they bring it for the good [they have done] or for the evil [they have committed]. The Holy One, blessed be He, says, "They are unable to discern between good and evil, and they bring an offering into My presence!" Rab Assi[2] (another version: Rab Hannina b. Pappa)[3] said: Take heed to thy orifices[4] at the time when thou standest in prayer before Me[5]. 

Our Rabbis have taught: When one is about to enter a privy, he should divest himself of the Tefillin at a [minimum] distance of four cubits and then enter, Rab Aha b. Rab Huna said in the name of Rab Sheshet: This teaching applies only to a regular privy[6], but with an occasional one, he may divest himself [of the Tefillin] and at once proceed to relieve himself; and when he comes out, he walks a distance of four cubits and relays them, because he has [by his use thereof] made it a regular privy. 

The question was raised : May a man, wearing his Tefillin, enter a regular privy for the purpose of urinating? Rabina permitted it; Rab Adda b. Mattena prohibited it. The question was put to Raba, and he replied : It is forbidden, because we are afraid that he may relieve himself otherwise while wearing them. Another version is : [We are afraid] that he may break wind while wearing them. 

There is a further teaching : When one is about to enter a regular privy, he divests himself of the Tefillin at a [minimum] distance of four cubits, leaves them on the window-sill which is near the public road, and then enters. When he comes out, he walks a distance of four cubits and relays them. These are the words of Bet Shammai. Bet Hillel declare that he may hold them in his hand and enter. R. 'Akiba says : He holds them in his garment and enters. In his garment, dost thou imagine? He may sometimes forget them and they will fall ! But say that he holds them in his garment with his hand and enters, leaving them in a hole near the privy, but not in a hole near the public road, lest some passer-by take them and it lead him into suspicion. For it once happened that a disciple left his Tefillin in a hole near the public road. A harlot came and took them, and then went to the House of Study and said, "Look what so-and-so gave me as my hire." When the disciple heard that, he went to the top of the roof, threw himself therefrom and died. On that occasion it was ordained that a man should hold the Tefillin in his garment with his hand and enter. 

Our Rabbis have taught : At first people used to leave the Tefillin in holes near the privy, but mice came and carried them away ; therefore it was ordained that they should be left on window-sills near the public road ; but because passers-by used to take them, it was ordained that they should hold them in their hand and enter. 

R. Meyasha, the grandson[1] of R. Joshua b. Levi, said : The Halakah is — One should roll them up like a book[2] and hold them in his right hand opposite his heart. Rab Joseph b. Minyomi said in the name of Rab Nahman : This is so, provided that the strap does not protrude from beneath his hand a handbreadth. R. Jacob b. Aha said in the name of R. Zera : This teaching only applies when there is still sufficient time left in the day to relay them; but if not, he should make for them a kind of bag, a handbreadth in size, and place them therein[3]. 

Rabbah b. Bar Hannah said in the name of R. Johanan : During the day he rolls them up like a kind of book and places them in his hand opposite his heart, but at night he makes for them a kind of bag, a handbreadth in size, and places them therein. Abbai said : This teaching only applies when the bag is reserved for that purpose ; but if it is not reserved for that purpose, it may be even less than a handbreadth in size. Mar Zotra (another version: Rab Ashe) said : Thou mayest infer that this is so from the fact that small vessels[4] protect [the contents from contracting defilement] in the tent of the dead. 

Rabbah b. Bar Hannah also said : At the time that we were following R. Johanan[1], on desiring to enter a privy, if he carried a book of Aggadta, he handed it to us; but if he carried Tefillin, he did not hand them to us. He said, "Since the Rabbis permit [[fol. 23 b.]] it, I will retain them[2]." 

Raba said : At the time that we were following Rab Nahman, if he carried a book of Aggadta, he handed it to us before entering a privy; if he carried Tefillin, he did not hand them to us. He said, "Since the Rabbis permit it, I will retain them." 

Our Rabbis have taught : A man should not hold the Tefillin in his hand, or a scroll of the Torah on his arm and say his prayers[3]. He may not urinate while holding them, or sleep with them, neither a regular sleep nor a chance sleep. Samuel said: A knife, money, a dish and a loaf come under the same rule. 

Raba said in the name of Rab Sheshet : The Halakah is not in accord with the above Baraita[4] because it emanates from Bet Shammai[5]; for if it emanated from Bet Hillel, since one is allowed to enter a regular privy [holding the Tefillin][6], how much more so a chance one[7]! It is quoted in objection: "What I have permitted thee in one place I have forbidden thee in another, [and this is an argument a fortiori which cannot be refuted"][8] — does this not refer to the Tefillin? It is quite right if thou sayest that the above Baraita emanates from Bet Hillel; for then I have permitted thee elsewhere[6] [to enter] a regular privy [with Tefillin], but here I forbid thee [to enter] a chance privy ! On the other hand, if thou sayest that it emanates from Bet Shammai, they do not permit it in either case[9] ! To what, then, does the quoted statement refer? 

To the question of one handbreadth or two. For one teacher states : When a man relieves himself, he should uncover himself one hand-breadth behind[1] and two in front[2]; and there is another teaching: He should uncover himself one handbreadth behind and not at all in front. It may be taken that both these teachings apply to a male[3], and there is no contradiction : the former referring to the major function of nature, the other to the minor. But how canst thou understand it in this way? For if the second teaching refers to the minor function, why uncover a handbreadth behind ? Nay ; they should both be referred to the major function, and there is no contradiction : the first teaching applying to a male, the other to a female[4]. If this be so, that which is mentioned in the sequel, viz. "This is an argument a fortiori which cannot be refuted" — what means it cannot be refuted? It is a natural proceeding[5]! Quite so; [therefore the quoted statement must refer to] the Tefillin, and the refutation of Raba in the name of Rab Sheshet remains unanswered. 

Nevertheless there is a difficulty: Since it is permitted to enter a regular priyy [with Tefillin], should it not be all the more permissible to enter a chance privy[6]! But this is what he means to say: They permit a regular privy[7] where there is no splashing [of urine likely to defile the hand which holds the Tefillin], but they prohibit a chance privy where there is this likelihood[8]. If so, why does it mention "[This is an argument a fortiori] which cannot be refuted "? [What has just been said] is an excellent refutation ! But this is what he means to say : This question [of carrying Tefillin in a regular privy but not a chance one] thou mayest argue with a reason[9]; but thou must not argue it by means of a fortiori deduction[1], for if thou usest this method of argument, it is an argument which cannot be refuted. 

Our Rabbis have taught : Who wishes to partake of a regular meal[2] should walk a distance of four cubits ten times, or a distance of ten cubits four times[3], and relieve himself ; after that he should enter [the dining-room]. R. Isaac said : Who is about to partake of a regular meal should first divest himself of his Tefillin and after that enter[4]. This is at variance with the opinion of R. Hiyya, who says: He leaves them upon his table, and thus it is becoming of him to do. How long [should he leave them there] ? Rab Nahman b. Isaac said : Until the time of saying Grace. 

One teacher stated : A man may tie up his Tefillin with liis money[5] in his underwear[6]. But there is another teaching : A man may not do so ! There is no contradiction. The latter refers to one who has assigned [a place in his underwear in which to deposit his Tefillin]; the other refers to a man who has not assigned such a place. For Rab Hisda said : In the cloth in which one assigns to tie up his Tefillin one must not tie up coins, if he has already placed the Tefillin therein. If he assigned to tie up his Tefillin in it but has not bound them therein, or if he has bound up his Tefillin in the cloth without such assignment, he may tie up money therein. But according to Abbai who said that the assignment is the criterion, if he assigned to deposit his Tefillin in the cloth, although he has not actually done so — or having bound them therein, if he thereupon assign it for the purpose — then it is forbidden [to tie up money therein] ; but if he has not made that assignment, it is not [forbidden]. 

Rab Joseph b. Rab Nehunyah[7] asked Rab Judah: May a man place his Tefillin beneath his pillow [at night] ? About placing them at the foot of the bed is no question, since that would involve disrespectful treatment; but I ask about placing them beneath his pillow — how is it ? He replied : Thus said Samuel : It is allowed, even if his wife be with him. Against this teaching is quoted : A man may not place his Tefillin at the foot of the bed because it would be disrespectful, but he may place them beneath his pillow. Should, however, his wife be with him, it is forbidden ; but if there is a place three handbreadths above or below[1], he may place them beneath his pillow ! The refutation of Samuel remains unanswered. 

Raba said : Although it is stated that the refutation of Samuel remained unanswered, nevertheless the Halakah is in accord with his view. What is the reason? The more one guards them [against [[fol. 24 a.]] contemptuous treatment] the better[2]. Where, then, should one place them? R. Jeremiah said : Between the mattress and the bolster, where he does not lay his head. But R. Hiyya has taught : He should place them in a bag under his pillow ! Yes, if he leaves the top of the bag protruding outside [the pillow]. Bar Kappara used to tie them in the bed-curtain, leaving the cases of the Tefillin outside[3]. Rab Shesha b. Rab Iddi used to place them upon a stool and spread a cloth over them. Rab Hamnuna[4] b. Rab Joseph said : On one occasion I was standing before Raba, and he said to me, "Go, bring me my Tefillin"; and I found them between the mattress and the bolster, where he did not lay his head ; and I knew that it was the day of bathing[5] and he had done this for the purpose of teaching us the Halakah for practice[6]. 

Rab Joseph b. Rab Nehunyah[7] asked Rab Judah : How is it when two sleep in one bed — does one turn his face away and read the Shema' and the other act likewise[8]? He answered : Thus said Samuel : [That is so] even if his wife is with him. Rab Joseph retorted : [Samuel mentions] his wife, but is it not the more necessary to mention [the case when he is with] somebody else? For on the contrary, his wife is like part of himself, whereas another is not like part of himself[1]! It is quoted in objection: If two sleep in one bed, one turns his face away and reads [the Shema'] and the other acts likewise. But there is another teaching: One who sleeps in a bed with his children or members of his household by his side should not read the Shema' unless a sheet separates between them ; but if his children or the members of his household are minors, then he is permitted [to read the Shema' without such separation]! This is quite right according to Rab Joseph and there is no contradiction [between the two teachings], the first referring to his wife, the second to somebody else[2]. But with Samuel's view there is a contradiction[3]. Samuel could reply to thee: Is it right according to Rab Joseph's opinion? For lo, there is a teaching : If a man sleeps in a bed with his children or the members of his household[4], he may not read the Shema' unless a sheet separates between them ! What, then, is there for thee to say ? There are Tannaim [who are at variance] on Rab Joseph's view of the question of the wife, and there are also Tannaim [who are at variance] on my view[5].
 
The mastersaid, "He turns his face away and reads the Shema'" — but their buttocks will be in contact ! This supports the opinion of Rab Huna who said that with buttocks there is no concern on the score of nakedness. It is possible to say that the following teaching is a support of Rab Huna's opinion, viz. : A woman may sit and cut off the Hallah while she is naked, because she is able to cover her nakedness with the ground[6]; but it is not so with a man. Rab Nahman b. Isaac explained this [as applying only to a case where] for instance, her nakedness is sunk in the ground[1]. 

The master said above, "If his children or members of his household are minors, it is permitted." Up to what age? Rab Hisda said[2]: With females, three years and one day; with a male, nine years and one day. Others declare : With females, eleven years and one day ; with a male, twelve years and one day — i.e. with both of them until the age when "the breasts were fashioned and the hair grown" (Ezek. xvi. 7). 

Rab Kahana asked Rab Ashe : Raba said above, "Although the refutation of Samuel's view remained unanswered, the Halakah is in accord with him" ; how is it here[3]? He replied : Wilt thou weave all these things in one web[4]? Nay, where it is said[5], it is said ; and where it is not said, it is not said. Rab Mari asked Rab Pappa : How is it if a hair protruded from his garment[6] ? The latter exclaimed : Hair is hair[7]. 

R. Isaac said : A handbreadth of a woman [if exposed] is nakedness. For what purpose? Is it a question of gazing upon her? Behold Rab Sheshet said : Why do the Scriptures enumerate the female ornaments worn outside together with those worn under the garments[8] ? This is to tell thee that whoever gazes upon the little finger of a woman is as though he had gazed at her nakedness ! Nay, [the statement of R. Isaac refers] to his wife and for the purpose of reading the Shema'[9]. 

Rab Hisda said : The calf of a woman's leg is to be regarded as nakedness; as it is said, "Uncover the leg, pass through the rivers" (Is. xlvii. 2) and it continues, "Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen" (Is. xlvii. 3). Samuel said : A woman's voice is to be regarded as nakedness ; as it is said, "For sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely" (Cant. ii. 14). Rab Sheshet said: A woman's hair is to be regarded as nakedness; as it is said, "Thy hair is as a flock of goats" (ibid. iv. 1). 

R. Hannina said : I have seen Rabbi hang up his Tefillin. Against this is quoted : He who hangs up his Tefillin will himself be hanged ! The Doreshe Hamurot[1] said, "And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee" (Deut. xxviii. 66) — this refers to one who hangs up his Tefillin ! There is no contradiction ; for this means one who hangs them up by the thongs, whereas Rabbi hung them up by the case. Or if thou wilt I can say that whether to hang them by the thong or case is forbidden ; and when Rabbi hung them up it was in a bag. If this be so, what need was there to mention it ? Thou mightest have said that the Tefillin require laying down like a scroll of the Torah ; therefore he informs us[2]. 

R. Hannina also said : I have seen Rabbi belch, yawn, sneeze, expectorate, and put his garment in order[3] [during his prayer], but he would not rewrap himself[4]; and when he yawned, he would place his hand upon his chin. Against this is quoted : He who makes his voice heard during prayer is of the small of faith[5]; he who raises his voice when praying is of the prophets of falsehood[6]; he who belches and yawns [during prayer] is of the proud of spirit; he who sneezes during prayer should regard it as a bad omen, and some say that it is an indication that he is contemptible; he who expectorates during prayer is as though he expectorated in the presence of the King ! It is quite right that there is no difficulty in the matter of belching or yawning, for here[1] it was an involuntary act and [the denunciation just quoted] refers to one who does it deliberately ; but there is a difficulty in the matter of sneezing[2]! No; there is no difficulty; for here[1] it was from above, but the latter refers to one who does so from below[3]. For R. Zera said : This thing was taught me in the school of Rab Hamnuna, and is equal in worth to me to all my studies[4]. 

He who sneezes during prayer may regard it as a good omen ; for just as it brings him gratification below [on earth], so will it bring him gratification above[5]. But there is a difficulty in the matter of expectoration! No, there is no difficulty; for it may be [that Rabbi acted] according to the teaching of Rab Judah who said : If one is standing in prayer and his spittle collected in his mouth, he may empty it into his Tallit, and if his Tallit is costly, he may empty it into his underwear[6]. Rabina was once standing before Rab Ashe [during prayer], and the spittle collected in the latter's mouth, and he expectorated behind him. Rabina said to him, "Does not the master hold the opinion of Rab Judah that one should empty his spittle into his underwear?" He replied, "I am fastidious [in this matter]." 

[The teacher stated above[7]:] "He who makes his voice heard during prayer is of the small of faith." Rab Huna said : This teaching applies only to one who is able to direct his heart when whispering [the words of prayer] ; but if he is unable to do so, he is permitted [to pray aloud]. And this holds good only of one praying alone ; but with a congregation it would cause disturbance to others. 

R. Abba was avoiding Rab Judah because he wished to go up to the land of Israel ; for Rab Judah declared : Whoever goes up from Babylon to the land of Israel commits a transgression because of [the injunction] which is stated, "They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be, until the day that I remember them, saith the Lord" ( Jer. xxvii. 22). R. Abba said : I will go and hear some teaching from him at the seminary and then I will depart. He went and found a Tanna teaching the following in the presence of Rab Judah : If one was standing in the Tefillah and broke wind, he should wait until the odour passes off and then resume the prayer [from where he interrupted it] ; another version is : If he was standing in the Tefillah and felt the need to break wind, he should step back four cubits and having relieved himself, wait until the odour passes off and then resume his prayer, saying, "Lord of the universe ! Thou hast created us with many orifices and vessels. Revealed and known to Thee is our shame and confusion in our lifetime, and in our end we are but worm and vermin"; he then resumes at the place where he interrupted. R. Abba said to him: Had I only come to hear this, it would suffice me. 

Our Rabbis have taught : If one is sleeping in his cloak and is unable to put forth his head because of the cold, he makes a sort of partition with his cloak around his neck and reads the Shema'. Others declare [that he makes the partition] by his heart. But according to the first Tanna, the heart sees the nakedness [during prayer] ! He holds that when the heart sees the nakedness, it is permitted [to read the Shema'].
 
Rab Huna said in the name of R. Johanan: If one is walking in filthy courtways [and the time for reading the Shema' arrives], he should place his hand over his mouth and read the Shema'. Rab Hisda said to him, "By God ! if R. Johanan had told me that himself, I would not have listened to him !" Another version is : Rabbah b. Bar Hannah said in the name of R. Joshua b. Levi : If one is walking in filthy courtways, he should place his hand over his mouth and read the Shema'. Rab Hisda said to him, "By God ! if R. Joshua b. Levi had told me that himself, I would not have listened to him !" But did Rab Huna really say that? For Rab Huna has said : A disciple of the wise is forbidden to stand in a filthy place, because it is impossible for him to stand anywhere without meditating upon Torah! There is no contradiction ; the latter refers to standing still, the former to walking. And did R. Johanan really say what is attributed to him? For lo, Rabbah b. Bar Hannah has said in the name of R. Johanan : One is permitted to meditate anywhere upon words of Torah except the bath-house and privy ! And shouldest thou urge that here also one refers to standing and the other to walking, it cannot be so ; because R. Abbahu once followed R. Johanan and he was reading the Shema', but when he reached the filthy courtways he lapsed into silence. He said to R. Johanan, "Where should I resume [my prayer] ?" He replied, "If thou hast waited sufficient time to finish the whole, return to the commencement" ! This is what R. Johanan meant to say to him, "As for me, I do not hold [that the reading of the Shema' should be interrupted] ; but as for thee, since thou dost hold that view, if thou hast waited sufficient time to finish the whole, return to the commencement." 

There is a teaching in agreement with Rab Huna and a teaching in agreement with Rab Hisda. There is a teaching in agreement with Rab Huna : If he was walking in filthy courtways, he should place his hand over his mouth and read the Shema'. There is a teaching in agreement with Rab Hisda : If he was walking in filthy courtways, he should not read the Shema' ; and not only so, but if he was reading it and entered [such a place], he should stop. If he did not stop, what then? R. Meyasha, the grandson of R. Joshua b. Levi, said : Of him the Scriptures state, "Wherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good, and ordinances whereby they should not live" (Ezek. xx. 25). R. Assi said : [Of him the Scriptures state], "Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity" (Is. v. 18). Rab Adda b. Ahabah said : From the following, "Because he hath despised the word of the Lord" (Num. xv. 31). But if he does stop, what is his reward? R. Abbahu said : Of him the Scriptures state, "Through this thing ye shall prolong your days" (Deut. xxxii. 47). 

Rab Huna said : If his cloak was girded about his loins[1], he is permitted to read the Shema'. There is a teaching to the same effect : If his cloak of stuff, or skin, or sackcloth was girded about his loins, he is permitted to read the Shema' ; but for the Tefillah [it is not permitted] until he covers his heart. [[fol. 25 a.]]

Rab Huna also said : If a man forgot and entered a privy wearing his Tefillin, he should place his hand over them until he finishes. Until he finishes, dost imagine? Nay, it is as Rab Nahman b. Isaac[2] has said : Until he finishes the first discharge[3]. Let him, then, stop at once and stand up! [No,] because of [the saying of] Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel ; for there is a teaching : Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel says : If the fecal discharge is kept back it causes dropsy, and if the fluid in the urinary duct is kept back it causes jaundice[4]. 

It has been reported : If there be filth upon his body, or his hand is placed within a privy[1], Rab Huna said : It is permitted to read the Shema' ; Rab Hisda said : It is forbidden to read it. Raba asked : What is Rab Huna's reason ? Because it is written, "Let everything that hath breath[2] praise the Lord" (Ps. el. 6). And Rab Hisda said : It is forbidden to read the Shema' [in such circumstances] — what is the reason ? Because it is written, "All my bones[3] shall say, Lord who is like unto Thee" (ibid. xxxv. 10). 

It has been reported : If there is a foul odour for which there is a cause [present][4], Rab Huna said : A man should remove himself a distance of four cubits[5] and read the Shema'. Rab Hisda said: He should remove himself a distance of four cubits from the place where the odour ceases and read the Shema'. There is a teaching in agreement with Rab Hisda : A man should not read the Shema' opposite the excrement of a human being, or of dogs, or pigs, or poultry ; nor opposite the filth of a dunghill which gives forth a bad odour. If there be a place ten cubits higher or lower[6], he sits down[7] at the side and reads the Shema'; but if not, he removes himself as far as he can see it. The same rule applies to the Tefillah. "If there is a foul odour for which there is a cause [present], he removes himself a distance of four cubits from the place of the odour and reads the Shema'." Raba said : The Halakah is not in agreement with this teaching in all these cases, but according to the following teaching : A man should not read the Shema' opposite the excrement of human beings[8], nor opposite that of pigs or dogs when he has placed skins therein[9].

Rab Sheshet was asked : How is it with a foul odour which has no [material] cause[10]? He replied : Come and behold the mats in the school of Rab, on which some are sleeping while others are studying[1]. But this refers only to words of Torah, not to the reading of the Shema'[2]. And even of words of Torah this is not said except [when the bad odour is caused] by another ; but if he himself is the cause, he must not [even study until the odour has passed off]. 

It has been reported : If manure is being carried past a person, Abbai said : It is permitted to read the Shema' ; Raba said : It is prohibited to read it. Abbai said : Whence do I derive my opinion ? For there is a Mishnaic teaching : If a ritually unclean person[3] is standing under a tree and a person who is ritually clean passes by him, the latter also becomes defiled. If, however, a person ritually clean is standing under a tree and an unclean person passes by, the former remains in his state of purity[4]; but should [the unclean person] remain standing there, then the former becomes unclean. The same law holds good with a stone which has become infected[5]. And Raba[6]? He can tell thee : In this latter circumstance the criterion is a fixed place ; for it is written, "He shall dwell alone ; without the camp shall his dwelling be" (Lev. xiii. 46)[7]. But here[8] the All-merciful declared, "Therefore shall the camp[9] be holy" (Deut. xxiii. 15), and behold that is not so. 

Rab Pappa said : A pig's snout is to be regarded as passing manure [for the purpose of reading the Shema']. That is obvious[10]! No; it is necessary [to mention it], because even if it just came up out of the river [it is to be so considered]. 

Rab Judah said : If one is uncertain whether excrement is present, it is forbidden [to read the Shema']. If one is uncertain whether urine is present, it is permitted. Another version is : Rab Judah said : If one is uncertain whether excrement is in the room, it is permitted [to read it], but by an ash-heap it is forbidden[1]. If one is uncertain whether urine is present, even by an ash-heap it is permitted. His opinion agrees with that of Rab Hamnuna who said : The Torah only forbids [the Shema' to be read] by fecal matter. He is also in agreement with R. Jonathan[2] who asked : It is written "Thou shalt have a place also without the camp, whither thou shalt go forth abroad" (Deut. xxiii. 13) and it continues, "And thou shalt have a paddle among thy weapons ; and it shall be when thou sittest down abroad, thou shalt dig therewith, and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee" (ibid. V. 14) — how is this[3]? The latter verse refers to the major natural function, the former to the minor. Infer, then, that the Torah forbids [the Shema' to be read] near to urine only when it is by fecal matter ; but if it has fallen upon the ground, it is permitted [by the Torah], but the Rabbis have decreed against it. Have the Rabbis decreed against it ? When it is certain [that urine is there] ; but if there is a doubt, they do not decree against it. 

Where it is certain [that urine is present], how long [must one wait before it is allowed to read the Shema' there] ? Rab Judah said in the name of Samuel : As long as the ground is sufficiently wet to moisten. The same reply is given by Rabbah b. Bar Hannah in the name of R. Johanan and by 'Ulla. Geniba said in the name of Rab : As long as the trace thereof can be recognised. Rab Judah said : May his teacher forgive Geniba[4]; since in the case of excrement Rab Judah said in the name of Rab : When the surface has hardened it is permitted [to read the Shema' thereby], how much more so with urine[5] ! Abbai said to him : What seest thou that thou reliest upon this; rely upon that which Rabbah b. Rab Huna said in the name of Rab[6] : It is forbidden [to read the Shema' near] excrement even when it is like earthenware. 

What means excrement like earthenware? Rabbah b. Bar Hannah said in the name of R. Johanan; When one can throw it to the ground without its crumbling to pieces. Others say : When one can roll it without its crumbling to pieces. Rabina said : I was once standing before Rab Jeremiah[1] of Difti ; he noticed some excrement, and he said to me, "See whether its surface has hardened or not[2]." Another version is : He said to him, "See whether it has become cracked." 

How, then, is it with reference to this matter ? It has been reported: When the excrement is like earthenware, Amemar said : It is forbidden ; Mar Zotra said : It is permitted. Raba said : The Halakah is — when the excrement is like earthenware it is forbidden ; and similarly with urine, so long as the ground is sufficiently wet to moisten. It is quoted in objection : With urine, so long as the ground is wet enough to moisten it is forbidden ; but if it has been absorbed [in the soil] or dried up[3], it is permitted. But is not soaking into the soil like drying up by the sun? [No ;] for as when it dries up, no trace can be recognised, so when it has penetrated into the soil, there must be no trace visible; but if there be such a trace, it is forbidden [to read the Shema' thereby] even though the ground be not sufficiently wet to moisten[4] ! But against thine own argument, I quote the first clause [of the Baraita brought in objection, viz. :] "With urine, so long as the ground is wet enough to moisten it is prohibited" ; hence if the trace of it be recognisable, it is permitted[5]! No such deduction can be drawn. 

It is possible to say that [the question under consideration] is like [the following discussion of] the Tannaim : It is forbidden to read the Shema' by a vessel from which urine has been poured; but with urine which has been poured out, if it has been absorbed it is permitted, if it has not been absorbed it is forbidden. R. Jose says : So long as the earth is sufficiently wet to moisten [it is forbidden]. What does the first Tanna understand by "absorbed" and "not absorbed" ? If it is supposed that "absorbed" means that the earth is not sufficiently wet to moisten, and "not absorbed" means that it can moisten, and R. Jose comes to declare, "So long as the earth is sufficiently wet to moisten" it is forbidden, but if the trace thereof can be recognised it is permitted — then he is in agreement with the first Tanna[1]! Nay, by "absorbed" he must mean that no trace can be recognised and by "not absorbed" that the trace is recognisable, and then R. Jose comes to declare, "So long as the earth is sufficiently wet to moisten" it is forbidden, but if the trace can be recognised it is permitted. No[2]; everybody agrees that so long as the earth can moisten it is forbidden, and [[fol. 25b.]] if the trace can be recognised it is permitted ; but here the point at issue is that the earth must be so wet as to moisten something which can moisten something else. 

If he had gone doum to bathe, should he have time to ascend, clothe himself and read [the Shema'] before sunrise, he must ascend, clothe himself and read. 

It is possible to say that the Mishnah states the law anonymously in agreement with R. Eliezer who declares: He may finish it any time until sunrise[3]. Thou mayest even say that it is in agreement with R. Joshua[4] and perhaps it is here like the Wetikin[5] ; for R. Johanan said: The Wetikin finish it with the sunrise. 

But if not, he should immerse his body in the water and read. 

But his heart sees his nakedness ! R. Eleazar (another version : R.Aha b. Abba b. Aha in the name of our master[6]) said : The teaching here refers to turbid water which is to be considered like the solid earth, so that his heart does not see his nakedness.
 
Our Rabbis have taught : With clear water, he must sit immersed up to his neck and read [the Shema'], while others declare he should stir up the water with his foot. But according to the first Tanna his heart sees his nakedness[7]! He holds that when his heart sees his nakedness, it is permitted [to read]. But lo, his heel sees his nakedness[8] ! He holds that when his heel sees his nakedness, it is permitted. 

It has been reported : If his heel sees his nakedness, it is permitted [to read the Shema']. If the heel touches, Abbai says : It is forbidden [to read] ; Raba says : It is permitted. So Rab Zebid taught this subject. Rab Hinnana b. Rab Ika, however, taught it thus : If the heel touches, all agree that it is forbidden [to read] ; but if the heel sees [the nakedness], Abbai says : It is forbidden ; Raba says : It is permitted, because the Torah was not given to the ministering angels[1]. The Halakah is : If the heel touches, it is forbidden ; if it sees, it is permitted. 

Raba said : If there be excrement in a transparent vessel, it is permitted to read the Shema' thereby ; if nakedness be in a transparent vessel[2], it is forbidden to read the Shema' thereby. "If there be excrement in a transparent vessel, it is permitted to read the Shema' thereby" ; because with excrement the criterion is whether it is covered : and behold it is covered. "If nakedness be in a transparent vessel, it is forbidden to read the Shema' thereby" ; because the All-merciful declared, "That He see no unseemly thing[3] in thee" (Deut. xxiii. 15), and behold it is visible. 

Abbai[4] said : Should the excrement be but a minute quantity, one can nullify it [by covering it] with spittle. Raba said : It must be with thick spittle. Raba said : If excrement be in a hole, he may place his sandal over it and read the Shema'. Mar b. Rabina asked : How is it if excrement adheres to his sandal ? The question remained unanswered. 

Rab Judah[5] said : It is forbidden to read the Shema' in the presence of a naked gentile. Why is a gentile specified ? Even by a naked Israelite it is likewise [forbidden] ! [That it is forbidden with an Israelite is obvious][6] ; but it was necessary to specify the case of a gentile. For thou mightest have said : Since it is written with reference to the gentiles, "Whose flesh is as the flesh of asses" (Ezek. xxiii. 20), argue that [in this matter the naked gentile is to be considered] only like an ass[7] ; therefore he informs us that to them also [when exposed] is "nakedness" attributed ; for it is written, "And they saw not their father's nakedness" (Gen. ix. 23)[8]. 

He may not immerse himself in evil-smelling water, nor water of soaking, until he has poured [fresh] water therein. 

How much water must he proceed to add[1]? Nay, the Mishnah must be read thus: He may not immerse himself at all in evil-smelling water, nor in water of soaking ; nor [may he read the Shema' by a vessel containing] urine, until he has poured [fresh] water therein, and then he may read it.
 
Our Rabbis have taught : How much water must be poured therein ? Any small quantity. R. Zakkai says : A fourth [of a Log]. Rab Nahman said : The difference of opinion applies only to [where the vessel contained urine and into which water has been poured] afterwards ; but if originally [the vessel contained water, and urine was then poured into it, then all agree] that any small quantity of water will suffice. But Rab Joseph said : The difference of opinion applies only to [where there was water] originally [and urine had afterwards been added] ; but where [water has to be added] afterwards, all agree that a fourth [of a Log] is necessary. Rab Joseph said to his attendant, "Bring me a fourth [of a Log] in accordance with the opinion of R. Zakkai." 

Our Rabbis have taught : It is forbidden to read the Shema' by a bed-pan for excrement or urine, although empty[2]; also by urine[3] until he has poured water therein. How much water should he pour therein ? Any small quantity. R. Zakkai says : A fourth [of a Log], whether it be before or behind the bed. Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel says : If it be behind the bed, he may read it[4] ; if it be before the bed he may not, but he removes himself a distance of four cubits and reads. R. Simeon b. Eleazar says : Even if the room be the size of a hundred[5] cubits, he may not read until he has removed it or placed it under the bed. 

The question was asked : How did [Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel] mean, "If [the urine] be behind the bed, he may read forthwith ; if it be before the bed, he removes himself a distance of four cubits and reads" ? Or perhaps he meant this : If it be behind the bed, he removes himself a distance of four cubits and reads ; if it be in front of the bed, he may not read at all ! Come and hear : For there is a teaching : R. Simeon b. Eleazar says : If it be behind the bed, he may read forthwith ; if it be in front of the bed, he removes himself a distance of four cubits. Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel says : Even if the room be the size of a hundred[1] cubits, he may not read until he has removed it or placed it under the bed. Our question is solved for us[2] ; but the two teachings are contradictory[3] ! Reverse [the names of the teachers] in the latter clause[4]. What seest thou to reverse [the names of the teachers] in the latter clause ? Reverse them in the former ! Whom hast thou heard say that a whole room is to be considered as four cubits[5]? It was R. Simeon b. Eleazar. 

Rab Joseph said : I asked Rab Huna, "If a bed is less than three [hand breadths] high, it is evident to me that it is to be regarded as solid [with the ground][6]; but how is it with three, four, five, six, seven, eight or nine?" He replied, "I do not know." There was certainly no need for me to ask about ten. Abbai said [to Rab Joseph], "Thou hast done well not to ask [about ten hand breadths] ; for every ten constitute a separate stratum." Raba said : The Halakah is that less than three is regarded as solid [with the ground], and ten constitute a separate stratum ; but it is about the height from three to ten that Rab Joseph questioned Rab Huna, and he was unable to explain it. Rab[7] said : The Halakah is in accord with R. Simeon b. Eleazar; and so declared Bali in the name of Rab Jacob, the son of Samuel's daughter[8] : The Halakah is in accord with R. Simeon b. Eleazar. But Raba maintained the Halakah was not in accord with him. 

Rab Ahai[9] contracted a marriage between his son and the house of Rab Isaac b. Samuel b. Marta. He led him under the wedding-canopy, but the marriage was not successfully consummated. Rab Ahai went to investigate the cause, and he noticed a scroll of the Torah lying in the bedroom. He said to them[10], "If I had not come now, you would have endangered my son's life ; for there is a teaching : It is forbidden to have connubial intercourse in a room where a scroll of the Torah or Tefillin are lying, until they are taken out or placed in a receptacle within a receptacle." Abbai said : This teaching applies only to a receptacle which is not used expressly for that purpose ; but if it is used for that purpose, even ten receptacles are only to be considered as one. Raba said : [[fol. 26 a.]] A cloth spread over a chest [containing sacred books] is regarded as a receptacle within a receptacle. 

R. Joshua b. Levi said : For a scroll of the Torah it is necessary to make a partition of ten [hand breadths][1]. Mar Zotra paid a visit to Rab Ashe's house, and saw the sleeping accommodation of Mar b. Rab Ashe, whereby a scroll of the Torah was lying and for which he had made a partition of ten handbreadths. He asked him, "According to whose opinion [hast thou done this]?" "According to R. Joshua b. Levi." "Under which circumstances did R. Joshua b. Levi say that ? When there is no other room ; but the master has another room !" He said to him, "I did not think of that." 

To what distance must he remove himself from it and excrement [if he wishes to read the Shema'] ? Four cubits. 

Raba said in the name of Rab Sahorah in the name of Rab Huna[2] : This teaching applies only to [excrement which is] behind him ; but if it is in front of him, he must remove himself as far as the eye can see it. Similarly is it with the Tefillah. But it is not so ! For Rafram b. Pappa said in the name of Rab Hisda : A man may stand opposite a privy and say the Tefillah ! With what are we here dealing ? With a privy which does not contain excrement[3]. But that is not so ! For Rab Joseph b. Hannina said : When they speak of a "privy" they mean even one in which there is no excrement, and when they speak of a "bath-house" they mean even one in which there is no person. But with what are we here dealing? With a new one[4]. And lo, Rabina raised the question : How is it with a place which had been designated to be used as a privy? Do we take account of the designation or not[5] ? How is this question of Rabina to be understood ? Whether one may stand in such a place to pray therein, not to pray over against it. Raba said : The privies of the Persians, although they may contain excrement, are to be regarded as closed in[1]. 

MISHNAH VI 

A man with a running issue who experienced emission, a menstruous woman from whom the semen has escaped, and a woman who during intercourse experiences the fiow require immersion; but R. Judah exempts them therfrom. 

GEMARA 

The question was asked : If a Ba'al Keri sees a flow, how is it according to R. Judah's view ? For although R. Judah there [in the Mishnah] exempts the man with a running issue who experienced emission — and such a man originally did not require immersion[2] — but a Ba'al Keri who experiences a flow — and such a man originally did require immersion — does he compel to have immersion ? Or perhaps there is no difference ? Come and hear : A woman who during intercourse experiences the flow requires immersion ; but R. Judah exempts her therefrom. Behold, a woman in these circumstances is identical with a Ba'al Keri who experienced a flow ; and since R. Judah exempts her, conclude [that he exempts him also]. R. Hiyya taught explicitly : A Ba'al Keri who experienced a flow requires immersion ; but R. Judah exempts him therefrom. 

May we return to thee : He whose dead !
