1 "Reading Shema' and Tefillah" is added by M. and is found in Semahot x (cf. Mo'ed Katon 23 b) from which this quotation is taken. Tefillin is not mentioned becaase the phylacteries are not worn on the Sabbath. 

2 M. : Rabban Gamaliel. 

3 Shema' and Tefillah. 

4 Between Rabban Simeon and the other Rabbis that the former raises this point. 

5 When this, as it sometimes does in Jewish law, becomes a duty, then Rabban Simeon does not allow it to be an exception to the rule that all signs of mourning must be discarded on the Sabbath. 

6 In contradiction to the inference drawn from our Mishnah. 

7 Not to the mourner who eats in another room or in a neighbour's house ; thus the Baraita presents no contradiction. 

8 Rejecting Rab Pappa's solution, Rab Ashe declares that "lying before him" is not to be understood literally, but means the duty of burial is still his. 

9 When he said "before me," Abraham was addressing the sons of Heth and was not in the actual presence of the body. 

10 The Jewish custom is not to leave the body alone until burial, there being somebody always present to "watch." See Oesterley and Box, p. 332. The reason is to protect the body from mice. Cf. below.

1 An act of respect shown to the dead stands in a higher scale, according to Rabbinic teaching, than to the living, because it is disinterested. On the phrase "Deal kindly and truly with me" (Gen. xlvii. 29) the Rabbis comment that "kindness of truth" is that performed to the dead; Gen. Rab. xcvi. 5. 

2 "Upon the graves" is added by M. The "fringes" are the Sisit attached to the corners of the garment. 

3 So literally; R.V, : a valiant man.

5 By "Moab" is here understood David who was descended from Ruth the Moabitess and provided the site for the Temple. 

6 To harden his body in order the better to master the intricacies of the Torah (= slay a lion). 

7 On the Sifra see p. 71 n. 6. It is regarded as the most difficult of the Halakic commentaries on the Pentateuch and is therefore called "a lion." He mastered this work on a winter's day, i.e. in a short space of time.

2 To Moses prior to his death. 

3 This is the reading of M. and is probably oorreot. The reading of the edd. : "Rab Pappa said, Somebody spoke evil" is intended to remove the reproach from him. 

4 M.: Rab Hisda said: This refers. 

==================================================

1 "Our Mishnah" usually means the paragraph of the Mishnah under discussion. Here it refers to the work as a whole. 

2 The washing of the hands before a meal is a Rabbinical ordinance, and to despite it reflects on the honour of the teachers. 

3 Num. v. 11 ff. 

4 They merely pretended to give her the bitter waters. This is the interpretation of many commentators. Rashi renders; "They administered them to one who was like themselves," i.e. despising Shemayah and Abtalion on the ground that they were not of pure Jewish stock. According to Gittin 57b they were descendants of Sennacherib, king of Assyria. 

5 On the Passover festival when the court was thronged with pilgrims. 

6 "The circle-drawer." He was a famous ascetic to whom the people 
appealed in time of drought to pray for rain. He thereupon drew a circle and declared he would not step outside it until God had sent rain. See Ta'anit 23 a. It has been suggested that the original meaning of Honi's name is not "circle-drawer" (which later legend gave it) but "roof-tiler," his occupation. Cf. T. A. I. p. 325 n. 381. The name Honi is more familiar in its Greek form "Onias." 

==================================================

----------
1 M.: "There is a teaching: R. Jose said." This reading is adopted by Bacher, A. B. A. p. 103 n. 11. 

2 With the head, legs and entrails (cf. Exod. xii. 9). But this should be done only by the pilgrims in Jerusalem, whereas Theodosius introduced the practice into Rome. 

3 According to M. the subject is "the Sages." Some edd. make the subject Simeon b. Shetah : but this would be an anachronism. See A.T. ii. p. 561 n. 1. 

4 Here, then, is another instance of arrogance against the Most High, 
since Theodosius altered the law. 

5 A portable earthenware oven is like an earthenware vessel and can contract defilement. In the latter instance, the vessel cannot be purified and must be broken to pieces. In the opinion of the Sages, the same rule applies to the oven. R. Eliezer allows the oven to be cut horizontally into layers and sand placed in between and cemented over. 

6 Krauss, p. 251, thinks that the word translated "serpent" is really a proper name, 'E ***, after whom that sort of oven was called. See his discussion in Part I of Lehnworter, pp. 295 f. 

7 Everything which had been in contact with this oven. 

8 Lit. "blessed," an euphemism.

1 That the Bet Din excommunicates a man for a lack of respect to a teacher. 

2 He holds that, as in the Baraita here quoted, wherever in the Mishnah an individual Rabbi resists the opinion of the majority, it comes under this heading. 

3 According to J. T., one hour before. 

4 Lay himself open to an imputation.

1 Where the mourner is standing. 

2 As spectators, not comforters. 

3 A mixture of wool and linen; cf. Lev. xix. 19, Deut. xxii. 11. 

4 By reason of a grave being there. 

5 Hence out of deference for a human being, they disregard an ordinance of the Torah. 

6 A Bet Peras is a field, half a furrow in length and breadth, on to which crushed bones may have been carried by a plough which had passed over a grave. Contact with even a fragment of a bone would cause defilement. Peras is of doubtful etymology. It is explained by some to mean "half"; cf. Dan. v. 28. Wiesner, p. 49, connects it with ***, because the corpse was usually first burnt. See also T. A.II. p. 490 n. 550. 

7 Therefore the deference they show to the mourner does not involve disregard of the Torah. 

8 Without contracting defilement. 

9 M. : Rab Judah b. Ammi in the name of Rab Judah. 

10 He was a Kohen and consequently forbidden to come into contact with the dead : cf. Lev. xxi. 1-3. 

11 Probably Agrippa I and Herod II; A. T. I. p. 47. 

==================================================

----------
1 In J. T. it is recorded that when Diocletian visited Tyre, R. Hiyya b. Abba (who was a Kohen) crossed a cemetery to meet bim. 

2 M.: Rabbah. 

3 They misunderstood him. He meant the only prohibition of the Torah set aside is that implied in the verse quoted, which teaches that the ordinances of the religious leaders of the age must be adhered to. Consequently, in actual practice, it is only Rabbinical injunctions which are set aside by the honouring of one's fellow-creatures. 

4 They allow their authority, though it is based on the Torah, to be set aside for this purpose. 

5 In the Hebrew, the negative "not" is attached to the verb "see" and has to be understood with "and bide thyself." According to the Rabbinic interpretation, since there is no negative qualifying "and hide thyself," it is to be deduced that there are times when one may not restore a straying animal. 

==================================================
Page 129
----------
1 Who is forbidden contact with the dead. 

2 I.e. his loss in restoring the animal would be greater than the owner's if it were not restored. M. reads "his loss" instead of "his work." 

3 Why should the Elder consider his dignity before the performance of a duty? 

4 The Torah expressly makes such an allowance. 

5 By analogy that one need not take off a garment in the street if diverse kinds are foand in it out of self-respect (seeing that the Elder is permitted to consider his dignity), but wait until be reaches his home. 

6 The matter of the straying animal involves nothing more than the owner's loss; it is consequently of less seriousness than a matter involving a principle. 

7 A Nazirite may not make himself ritually unclean by contact with the dead. The list of relations is: father, mother, brother, sister; and the Halakic commentary on Numbers and Deuteronomy, the Sifre, discusses the reason why each is mentioned : He may not defile himself for his father, but he must for a Met Miswah (see Glossary, s.v.); nor for his mother, but even if he be a Kohen as well as a Nazirite (i.e. doubly prohibited against such contact), he must defile himself for a Met Miswah ; nor for his brother, but even if he be the High Priest as well as a Nazirite, he must defile himself for a Met Miswah. The explanation of "his sister" is given in the Gemara. 

8 The Nazirite who is a High Priest. 

9 Which had to be performed at a certain time, and he would be precluded from officiating if he were unclean. 

==================================================
Page 130
----------
1 The duty of burial is to show respect to the body; why should respect for a person set aside the Pentateuchal prohibition against defilement? 

2 And (according to the Rabbinic deduction above) the Torah gives him permission. 

3 No analogy can be drawn between the wearing of mixed stuff and the burial of a Met Miswah, because they fall into different categories. The former is a prohibition as an act — one has to "arise and do" [*** ***] it (by putting on the garment), to commit the transgression. With the Met Miswah, on the other hand, it is the omission to bury which constitutes the transgression. To "sit and do nothing " [*** *** ***] is what is forbidden. 

4 The Fourth Order of the Mishnah. The detailed division of the Mishnah is given in an Appendix by Oesterley and Box. 

5 The last Tractate of the Sixth Order. 

6 The disputations between Rab and Samuel are proverbial for their complexity. 

7 Others explain: with thirteen different methods of interpretation. In either case, the intention is that the superiority of earlier generations could not be on the score of learning. 

8 He merely prepared himself to fast and pray for rain. On any occasion of mourning or self-humiliation, the shoes are taken off. 

9 Some edd. read "Samaritan," to satisfy the scruples of the Censor. 

10 A word of uncertain meaning; either a kind of headgear or a showy mantle worn by disreputable women. The same word occurs in Dan. iii. 21 where R.V. renders "mantle"; but the Oxford Lexicon, ed. Brown, etc., p. 1097b prefers "cap." 

==================================================
Page 131
----------
1 There is a double play of words. Matun means "deliberate"; hence if he had not been hasty, it would have saved him 400 Zuz. Matun also resembles the word for "two hundred," which being repeated, totals 400. 

2 The bath of purification, called Mikweh, is here intended. Certain regulations had to be observed, otherwise the act of purification would be invalid. 

3 On the beauty of R. Johanan, see fol. 5 b, p. 24. 

4 The malignant power which bewitches and harms its victims. It is often used, as here, to denote sexual passion. The belief in the Evil Eye was widespread in the Orient; cf. J. E. v. p. 280; Lane, pp. 256 f. 

5 Joseph who rejected the advances of Potiphar's wife. 

==================================================

1 "Command" is literally "command of Do" as distinct from a prohibition — "command of Do not." 

2 This paragraph is omitted in some edd. 

3 The law of Tefillin (Deut. vi. 8) is immediately followed by the law of Mezuzah (ibid. v. 9) ; the inference might therefore be drawn that they are identical in scope of obligation. 

4 The command to "teach them diligently unto thy children" (ibid. v. 7) might be placed in the same class as the law to "write them upon the doorposts" (ibid. V. 9). 

==================================================

----------
1 See Singer, p. 124, Oesterley and Box, pp. 375 ff. 

2 The obligation to "observe" belongs to women, because there are several "prohibitions" (see p. 132 n. 1) in connection with the Sabbath. 

3 We "remember" the Sabbath by the Kiddush (see Glossary, s.v.). 

4 By saying Grace after meals on their behalf. 

5 That a woman may say Grace for her husband and a son for his father. 

6 I.e. ordained by the Torah, since that is presupposed in the argument. 

==================================================

1 According to R. Meir, food the size of an olive ; according to R. Judah, the size of an egg. See fol. 45 a. 

2 The minor. 

3 The father who has eaten only the quantity required by the Rabbis. The question at the head of the paragraph remains unanswered ; but the Halakah regards the woman as being enjoined by the Torah to say Grace, as implied in our Mishnah. 

4 Lit. "Who lifteth up not the countenance." 

5 I.e. he does not even meditate on the benedictions. 

6 Cf. Exod. xix. 15. The Israelites had to be ritually clean just to hear the Divine words. Therefore to hear (and consequently, to meditate upon) Torah is the equal of utterance.

2 M. adds: in the name of Rab. 

3 See fol. 11 b, p. 71. 

4 In Joma 37a this verse is explained as follows: When Moses was about to begin his song, he said to Israel, "I will open with a benediction, viz. 'For I will proclaim the name of the Lord,' and ye will respond with 'Ascribe ye greatness unto our God '."

1 I.e. it is not ordained by the Torah. 

2 No analogy can be drawn between the material gratification derived from a meal and the spiritual gain from studying Torah.

4 The opening words of the benediction after the Shema' ; Singer, p. 42. 

5 The words of Torah upon which the ordinance to read the Shema' is based; see fol. 2a, p. 2. How, then, can it be said that this ordinance is by the Rabbis? 

6 And not the reading of the Shema'. See p. 85. 

7 See Singer, p. 43.

1 Consequently, the uncertainty gives one a reason for saying the Tefillah again. 

2 I.e. the benediction in which they discovered their error. 

3 This opinion apparently contradicts that of Rab Judah who said that the prayer must be interrupted immediately the mistake is discovered. 

4 Of the person who read the week-day Tefillah on the Sabbath. 

5 Of the person who was reading the Tefillah for the second time. 

6 Of saying the Tefillah a second time in error. 

==================================================

----------
1 Which points out that even if the Tefillah has been commenced a second time, he mast stop as soon as he recalls his mistake. 

2 Singer, p. 51, at which words the Congregation bows and makes a response. 

3 In order to be able to make the necessary response. 

4 Singer, p. 45, "We will sanctify," to which also the Congregation makes responses. 

5 Therefore being able to say it individually, Rab Huna allows him up to "We give thanks unto Thee" in which to say the Tefillah. 

6 It must be said with the Congregation ; therefore if he cannot say the Tefillah before making the responses, he should not commence it. 

7 On the argument, see p. 18 n. 5. 

8 It cannot be deduced from Num. xvi. 21 that there were ten. In the parallel passage (Megillah 23b), a further analogy is drawn between the use of the word "Congregation" here and in ibid. xiv. 27 where the reference is to the twelve spies, minus Joshua and Caleb. See p. 28 n. 2. 

9 In the Kaddish; see p. 8 n. 4.

2 Lit. "the Work of the Chariot," the tbeosophical teaching about the Heavenly Chariot, derived from Ezek. i. and x. This was regarded as one of the highest forms of study upon which but a chosen few should venture, after severe mental and physical discipline. See J. E. viii. p. 498; Abelson, Jewish Mysticism, Chap. ii.

6 But the mode of her death is not mentioned. 

7 This is not stated in the Torah ; but see Sanh. 54 b. 

8 I.e. use the severest form of execution (viz. stoning) on such flimsy grounds! He therefore proceeds to give a stronger argument. 

==================================================
Page 140
----------
1 Why is it specially mentioned of them that they shall be stoned? Cf. Lev. XX. 27. 

2 This is an illustration of the eighth of R. Ishmael's exegetical principles by which the Torah is expounded : If anything is included in a general proposition [diviners are in the category of sorcerers] and is then made the subject of a special statement [as in Lev. xx. 27], that which is predicated of it [viz. death by stoning] is not to be understood as limited to itself alone, but is to be applied to the whole of the general proposition ; Singer, pp. 13 f. It is hereby shown that R. Judah rejected the inference from juxtaposition and based his conclusion upon this rule. 

3 M. more accurately : For there is a Mishnaic teaching. What follows is from Mishnah Jebamot xi. 1. 

4 Why, then, does not R. Judah accept the deduction from Deut. iv. 9 f . above that a Ba'al Keri is forbidden to study Torah? 

5 Accordingly, while R. Judah adopts the method in Deuteronomy, he does not accept the deduction which R. Joshua b. Levi drew from the verses quoted. 

6 Before reading the Shema' or studying Torah. 

==================================================

1 This would be contrary to the lenient view taken by R. Judah in the Mishnah on fol. 20b, p. 134. 

2 Who compel even him to have immersion. 

3 But this conclusion leaves the difficulty in note 1 unanswered. 

4 The statement of R. Judah in the Mishnah (fol. 20b, p. 134) is altered to harmonise with his opinion as expounded above. 

5 This proves that, according to R. Judah, meditation does not suffice. 

6 The name of an apocryphal Mishnaic Tractate (see Mielziner, p. 64) which has not the authority of the standard Mishnah, and R. Judah permits it to be read by a Ba'al Keri.

2 This word is added by M. 

3 Because it is assumed that their experience resolts from levity of mind. 

4 And consequently will not require the concentration of his thoughts. 

5 M. reads : He may expound the Mishnah but not the Midrash. R. Eleazar b. Shammua' says : Also the Midrash may he expound, etc. Rashi also reads Midrash for Talmud.

1 In Ta'anit 21a it is related that under the most adverse circumstances his usual exclamation was Gam zu letobah, "This also is for good"; hence his name. Others conjecture that the two words should be combined to read Gimzo, a town in Judea; cf. II Chron. xxviii. 18. 

2 He wished it to be generally known that the Ba'al Keri could easily restore himself to a state of purity and resume his duties of studying Torah and rearing a family. 

3 He did not want the Ba'al Keri easily to regain his state of purity. 

4 By allowing the Ba'al Keri to be clean after nine kabs of water had been poured over him. The stricter view demanded complete immersion in a bath containing a minimum of forty Saot.

6 He draws an analogy between studying Torah and saying Grace. 

7 In forty Saot, because he used then to teach Torah ; but on other days, when studying for himself, be poured nine Kabs over himself.

3 It refers here to reading a portion of the lection in the Synagogue ; and the minimum which constitutes a portion is three verses.

1 This is the literal rendering of the Hebrew, and it suggests the comment which follows, R.V. "for they know not that they do evil," 

2 This is the reading of M. which is preferable to that of edd. : Ashe. 

3 M.: Rab Pappa, 

4 This is an alternative explanation of "Guard thy foot" — "foot" being explained as in I Sam. xxiv. 4. 

5 M. : before Him. 

6 This means any spot which has already been used for such a purpose; whereas the "occasional" is one which is thus used for the first time. 

==================================================

1 This reading of M. (instead of "son" in edd.) is confirmed by fol. 24b, p. 161. 

2 M. : like a Scroll of the Law. In ancient times, books were in scroll form. 

3 A bag of that size would prevent its contents from contracting defilement. 

4 Even less than a handbreadth in size.

1 As his disciples. 

2 Rashi renders "Let them protect me" so. from evil spirits which frequeut such a place. M. omits the word altogether. 

3 The fear lest they will fall might disturb his ability to concentrate his mind on his prayer. Blau, Das altjudische Zauberwesen, p. 150 n. 7, suggests a different reason for the origin of this law. It is an allusion to a superstitious practice whereby these sacred objects were held in the hand as amulets while reciting incantations. Similarly, passages from the New Testament were used as charms by Christians ; see Grenfell and Hunt, Oxyrhyncus Papyri, Part viii. 

4 Viz. that a man may not urinate while holding the Tefillin. 

5 So above (fol. 23 a, p. 150) where Bet Shammai teach that the Tefillin must be left on the window-sill 

6 See above, fol. 23a, p. 150. 

7 Since it is solely for the purpose of urinating, it is assumed that the Baraita refers to an occasional privy. 

8 These words are added by M. and are quoted in the Gemara below. 

9 The conclusion is therefore: either the statement of Raba is wrong, or the quotation "What I have permitted" etc. cannot refer to holding the Tefillin in a privy. 

==================================================

----------
1 Not more, from a sense of modesty. 

2 To avoid soiling his clothes. 

3 And then the statement "What I have permitted" etc. would hold good here. 

4 Then the quoted statement could be taken to mean : What I have permitted thee in the case of a male I have forbidden thee in the case of a female. 

5 For a man to uncover in front and a woman behind, and there is no argument a fortiori here at all. Consequently we cannot find anything to which the quoted statement "What I have permitted thee" etc. can be made to refer except the Tefillin. 

6 Bet Hillel permit the former (see fol. 23a, p. 150), but according to the result of the reasoning in the former paragraph, they forbid the latter ! 

7 To which one resorts for the purpose of the major function. 

8 Since it is used as a urinal only. 

9 Viz. the probability of soiling the hand with urine. 

==================================================
Page 154
----------
1 As follows: An occasional privy is not to be treated as strictly as a regular one; if then we are permitted to hold the Tefillin in the latter, how much more so in the former! This is irrefutable as an argument, but it nevertheless leads to a wrong conclusion. We have consequently to base our position on the practical consideration of the possibility of soiling the hand. 

2 It speaks here of a meal at which he will be one of several guests, and it would be deemed impolite if he had to leave the table daring the meal. 

3 Each time he should examine himself and see whether he needs relief. 

4 Lest he become intoxicated and behave in an unbecoming manner while wearing them. 

5 Not together, but in two separate parcels. 

6 So Jastrow; others explain the word to mean a head-cloth or turban.

1 I.e. his pillow on which he could place them in case of necessity. 

2 If they were left lying about mice might get at them. 

3 I.e. not facing the bed. 

4 M. : Nehemiah. 

5 For Raba's wife after her period of separation. 

6 Viz. as Samuel taught : It is allowed, even if his wife is with him. 

7 M. : Nehemiah. 

8 Throughout this discussion it must be remembered that in the Orient it was the general custom in the Summer to sleep quite naked; cf. Lane, p. 158. Even in the Winter people often slept naked because of lack of clothing. See p. 157 n. 1. 

==================================================
Page 156
----------

1 By using the word "even," Samuel implied that the more lenient view is to be taken when he is with somebody else. Rab Joseph retorts that the more lenient view is to be taken when his wife is with him, because she is to be considered part of himself. 

2 Since he holds that his wife is part of himself, he does not require a sheet between them, but with others he does. 

3 For he said "Even if his wife is with him." If, therefore, he does not require a sheet with her, he cannot require one with somebody else. 

4 According to Rashi, "members of his household" must here be understood to include his wife. Later commentators (see Tosafot) reject this, and correct the text to read "with his wife, he may not turn away and read the Shema' unless there is a garment separating between them." 

5 I.e. the dispute between Samuel and Rab Joseph goes back to the days of the Tannaim, and there are Baraitot (irreconcilable with each other) to be quoted in support of both opinions. 

6 Although the posterior parts are exposed; thus supporting Rab Huna's view. 

==================================================

1 So that even the posteriors are covered; consequently the Mishnah offers no support to Rab Huna. Buchler, Der galilaische 'Am ha'ares, p. 252 n. 1, points out that the circumstance here debated is not far-fetched and imaginary ; but the extreme poverty into which a section of the people had sunk, so that some of them had actually no clothing, made it a question of practical importance. See also T. A. I. pp. 134 ff. 

2 M. : Rafram b. Pappa said in the name of Rab Hisda. 

3 Although Samuel's opinion respecting the reading of the Shema' when a man is in bed with others is refuted by Rab Joseph, is the Halakah in agreement with him ? 

4 Class them all together. 

5 That the Halakah is in accord with Samuel. 

6 If the man's garment was torn so that hair protruded, is this to be deemed nakedness in connection with the reading of the Shema'? 

7 It is to be ignored. 

8 Cf. Is. iii. 18-24. 

9 I.e. he may not read the Shema' in these circumstances.

1 M. : Doreshe Reshumot. Both these terms are the names of ancient Schools of Bible interpreters. See the exhaustive discussion of Lauterbach in J. Q. R. (New Series) i. pp. 291-333, 503-531. His conclusion is, "The Doreshe Hamurot were, therefore, those allegoristic interpreters of the law whose method and tendency were to find the importance and significance of the law, its real meaning and purpose, since it is this, the real meaning and purpose, that gave the law weight and importance ; and they considered the importance and significance of the law, its homer, to lie, not in the plain meaning of the letter of the law, but in the spirit of the law and its allegorical meaning, which they would read into it"; ibid. p. 509. 

2 That they may hang in a bag. 

3 This is how some of the commentators understand the phrase. According to Rashi, it means "search in his garment (so. for vermin)" which are unescapable in the East ; cf. Lane, p. 3. 

4 In his Tallit, if it fell from him during prayer.

2 Since it is regarded as an involantary act. 

3 The verb "to sneeze" is also used euphemistically in the sense "to break wind," 

4 He was susceptible to sneezing and experienced it even when praying. Hence this teaching relieved his mind. 

5 It is a sign his prayer will be heard in Heaven. Mr H. Loewe drew my attention to a Latin parallel : "Hoc ut dixit, Amor, sinistra ut ante, dextra sternuit approbationem" ; Catullus 45.

9 The excrement of these animals was used for cleaning purposes; cf. T. A.I. p. 154 and p. 574 n. 346.

1 Although some of the sleepers may cause a foul odour, others are studying, an indication that the Shema' may be read under such conditions. 

2 The cases are not analogous ; he must remove himself from the odour before reading the Shema'. 

3 E.g. a leper. 

4 According to Abbai, this is analogous to the quoted Baraita ; so if the passing leper does not cause defilement, the passing manure should not interfere with the reading of the Shema'. 

5 Cf. Lev. xiv. 37 ff. If the stone is carried past a man, he is not infected ; if it is set down where he is, he does contract defilement. 

6 What reply can he make to the reasoning upon which Abbai bases his view? 

7 The analogy is false, because the quoted Mishnah only means to teach that the leper defiles any place where he stands for a while, which thus becomes temporarily his "dwelling." 

8 The circumstance of the passing manure and saying the Shema'.
