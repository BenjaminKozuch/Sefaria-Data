MISHNAH I 
[[fol. 86 a.]]

1 That a benediction is necessary. 

2 The word is in the plural, and being unspecified is considered to mean two. There must accordingly be two praises (i.e. benedictions), one before and one after. 

3 The fruit grown in the fourth year, of which Lev. xix. 24 speaks. That fruit is declared to be "holy" and may not be eaten, unless previously redeemed. 

4 This will be explained as referring only to the fruit of the vineyard. Since these two teachings are drawn from the use of the plural hillullm, it cannot mean that a benediction is necessary before and after partaking of fruits. 

===================================================

Page : 234
----------
1 Only when a drink-offering was brought did the choir of the Levites sing in the Temple ; and in this way the wine "cheered" God. 

2 That hillulim refers to the benediction before and after fruits. 

3 That Lev. xix. 24 refers to all fruit of the fourth year and not to the vine only; consequently the second deduction from hillulim need not be used to prove that only the vine requires redemption, but can be used to show that a benediction is required when partaking of fruits. 

4 Since the second deduction from hillulim is required to prove that only the vine required redemption, how does he show that a benediction is required when partaking of fruits? 

5 That the second hillul can also show that the benediction is required over fruits. 

6 See p. 18 n. 5. 

7 Cf. Deut. viii. 10. 

8 And he is about to satisfy his hunger. 

9 The reasoning in the preceding paragraph is based on the assumption that Lev. xix. 24 refers to a vineyard. 

===================================================

Page : 235
----------

1 Cf. Lev. xix. 10. Since the gleanings have to be left behind, he must say a benediction over what he enjoys of the vineyard ; but the law of gleanings does not apply to other fruits, therefore the inference just drawn is not valid. 

2 The law of gleanings does not apply to corn ; and yet a benediction is necessary over bread. 

3 It is not, because Hallah does not apply to the vineyard, and yet the latter requires a benediction. 

4 The objections having been disposed of. 

5 Viz. gleanings and Hallah. 

6 That they are both enjoyed. 

7 In the drink-offering and meal-offering ; hence other fruits do not come in the same category for the purpose of the benediction. 

8 Lit. "vineyard of olives." Since the olive is included because kerem is mentioned in connection therewith, the objection that the common factor is the altar lapses. 

9 Cf. Deut. viii. 8. 

===================================================

Page : 236
----------

1 From the common use of "land" in Deut. viii. 8 and ibid: xxvi. 2 it is deduced that the law of first-fruit applies only to the "seven species" (see Menahot 84 b). Therefore the necessity for a benediction with things outside this category has still to be proved. 

2 This statement not only answers the question about things which are not planted, but also the question about the factor of "first-fruit" in connection with the seven species. 

3 The word used here, ma'al, refers to the offence of utilising property belonging to the Temple by a non-priest. The Universe is regarded as the Divine Temple; but by virtue of the benediction, one becomes consecrated and permitted to partake of its produce. 

===================================================

Page : 237
----------

1 By omitting to pay to Ood the benediction due to Him, he withholds the divine blessing from Israel and the fields will not be fruitful. 

2 I.e. taken literally, and consequently no time be devoted to earning a livelihood. 

3 And in addition find leisure for Torah. 

===================================================

----------

1 Viz. they combined Torah with work. Cf. Abot ii. 2 ; Singer, p. 187. 

2 The first and seventh months of the year, corresponding with March — April and September — October, the time of the ripening of corn and the pressing of grapes. By devoting these two months to work, the remainder of the year could safely be given to Torah. Raba accordingly agreed with R. Ishmael. 

3 M. omits: in the name of, etc. 

4 See Krauss, p. 271, on the word. The meaning is : They bring it straight into the house. 

===================================================

Page : 239
----------
1 There is no special name in Hebrew for the olive-tree as there is for the vine. 

2 This point remaining unanswered, the Gemara proceeds to discover other reasons why wine should have a special benediction. 

3 Viz. wheat, barley, rye, oats and spelt. Rab and Samuel would restrict the term "food," without further qualification, only to these and not, e.g., to oil. 

4 The word "food" in the quoted Mishnah is not used in the technical sense Rab and Samuel would give it, but means anything that nourishes. Since water and salt are alone excluded from this category, oil must be included. 

5 After wine as after bread, i.e. the full Grace after meals; see fol. 37a, p. 250. 

6 Therefore, it cannot be regarded as food, and only one benediction is necessary. 

7 M. omits: b. Isaac. 

8 Would three benedictions be necessary? 

9 Who will solve all problems left in doubt. 

10 Viz. to fix a meal on account of wine. 

===================================================

Page : 240
----------
1 I.e. how is it necessary to have a benediction for oil? 

2 In which case no benediction is required. 

3 See Lev. xxii. 14 according to which the man pays the additional fifth "if he eat of the holy thing," i.e. is nourished thereby. But oil has no beneficial effect on the body, therefore he pays only the value. 

4 Enigaron, a corruption of ***, a sauce of oil and garum. See Krauss, p. 72. 

5 M. : Rab Judah said in the name of Samuel. The words in round brackets are a gloss to explain the Greek terms. 

6 When it is said oil requires a benediction. 

7 And uses oil as a remedy. 

8 That one may swallow oil added to an elaiogaron on the Sabbath ; so why is it mentioned ? 

9 The fact that it is permitted on the Sabbath proves that legally it is something to be enjoyed, the healing property being only incidental. And further, since the mixture is taken because of the oil, this is the principal 

===================================================

Page : 241
----------
1 The point at issue is whether the grinding of the corn into flour alters its nature for the purpose of the benediction. Rab Judah maintains it does not. 

2 By being pressed from the olive. 

3 And there is no change in the benediction. 

4 And the benediction should be "...Who createst the fruit of the ground." 

5 If not, why is barley-flour specified? 

6 Which is inferior to wheaten-flour. 

7 That one could imagine barley-flour requires no benediction, whereas salt or brine does ! 

8 Edd. read incorrectly: A Mishnaic teaching. The quotation is a Baraita; cf. fol. 40 b, p. 268. 

9 To specify barley-flour above, despite this objection. 

===================================================

1 "A white, meaty, sweet and tasty substance" in the young palm ; Low, Aramaische Pflanzennamen, p. 116. 

2 If not extracted while the palm is young, it become part of the tree. 

3 Bacher, A.B. A., p. 51 n. 27 declares that the rendering "Thou keen-witted one" is not beyond dispute, and the expression may refer to his iron endurance in study. 

4 There can be no comparison of the two. 

5 When the heart is extracted, the palm withers; therefore it does not bear the same relation to its tree as other fruit does. 

6 M. adds: " ...Who createst the fruit of the ground." 

7 So Low, op. cit. p. 264. Jastrow translates "caper-flowers." Rashi explains "husks." 

8 From this it is seen that "Who createst the fruit of the ground" is said over the leaves and shoots although the caper is not grown to obtain these; why, then, should that formula not be used for the palm-heart although the palm is not planted for the sake of the heart ? 

9 By calling him "n-witted." 

===================================================

----------
1 And for that reason may not be eaten when in a state of 'Orlah. 

2 Hence the buds are regarded as fruit. 

3 I.e. Rab, whose name M. includes in the text. 

4 M.: Eleazar, incorrectly. 

5 And the buds are not fruit.
 
6 If R. 'Akiba's view is the correct one. 

7 As R. 'Akiba does. 

8 That one may eat the buds oatside the Land even when in a state of 'Orlah. 

9 I.e. in a state of 'Orlah. 

10 That the tithe is only to be given of the caper-berries, and not the bads. 

11 They would also permit the berries to be eaten. 

===================================================

Page : 244
----------
1 If it were a fruit, it would not constitute Kila'im. 

2 Because vegetables are not subject to 'Orlah. 

3 As to the category of the caper-bush. 

4 And declare it Kila'im in a vineyard and subject to 'Orlah. 

5 Here Rabina's question to Mar. b. Rab Ashe is resumed. 

6 Because Lev. xix. 23 applies the law only to "the land." 

7 He is then in doubt whether the tree is in its fruit three years. Hence, Rabina declares, Mar would be right in eating the berries as well as the buds. 

8 Consequently only the berries are to be regarded as fruit, and not the buds; and Mar acted accordingly. 

9 I.e. it has no authority. Hence there is no doubt that the caper-bush is subject to 'Orlah. 

10 That even the bud is subject to 'Orlah. 

11 This is the literal rendering of the Hebrew, the grammatical construction of which is peculiar. 

12 The rind, shell, etc. 

13 The caper-bud falls from the bush when ripe; hence it cannot be regarded as a protection so that it should be subject to 'Orlah. 

14 With the fruit to make up the minimum bulk which can contract impurity. 

===================================================

Page : 245
----------
1 And the blossom bears the same relationship to the pomegranate that the caper-bud does to the berry. 

2 If, then, the pomegranate-blossom is subject to 'Orlah, so shoald the caper-bud be. 

3 See p. 244 n. 12. 

4 That the protection must be attached to the ripened fruit. 

5 I e. is subject to 'Orlah. 

6 The Halakah is in agreement with the Rabbis; and since the caper-bad corresponds to the grape-bud, it too should not be subject to 'Orlah. 

7 M. adds: b. Ashe. 

8 See p. 74 n. 2. 

9 I.e. other than the vine. 

10 The year of agricultural rest; cf. Exod. xxiii. 11, Lev. xxv. 4. 

11 M.: Ashe. 

12 I.e. mark the same stage of growth. The Boser is the soar grape, the Garua' the grape when the stone inside is formed. 

13 Who differ from R. Jose. 

===================================================

----------
1 Therefore we cannot argue from one to the other. The remainder of the paragraph reads like a marginal gloss incorporated into the text. 

2 Because it is not regarded as a food. 

3 He has not broken the strict fast enjoined on that day. 

4 Hence pepper is a food. 

5 Between the view of Raba and R. Meir. 

6 I.e. preserved, over which a benediction is required. 

7 M.: Rabina. 

8 To be eaten by Jews although prepared by a Gentile. 

9 Since a benediction is necessary, it must be a food ; how, then, could the Rabbis tell Maremar that it may be chewed on the Day of Atonement?

1 A mixtare of flonr, honey and oil beaten into a pulp. It seems to resemble the Arabic Kunafeh, a sweet dish made of wheat-floor fried with clarified butter and honey; cf. Lane, p. 150, T.A. i. p. 477 n. 465. 

2 Without honey added.

3 I.e. to be regarded as such for the purpose of the benediction.

1 Therefore rice cannot be in the same category as wheat. 

2 And according to them the benediction for rice is: "...Who createst various kinds of foods." 

3 Who maintained above that this benediction is restricted to the five species, excluding rice. 

4 M. inserts: Rab Huna said. 

5 Who requires a special benediction for each species ; see fol. 40 a, p. 264. 

6 Enumerated in Deut. viii. 8. 

7 M. adds: and R. 'Akiba. 

8 Rabban Gamaliel expected R. 'Akiba to follow his teaching and say three benedictions. 

===================================================

----------

1 The name of Rabban Gamaliel. 

2 M. adds : which is an abstract of three. 

3 In the Baraita above, it is stated "if a kind of corn it has not been made into bread" as, e.g., pounded grain. 

4 Since they were originally bread. 

5 According to them pounded grain only requires one benediction, and similarly boiled bread which is no longer in pieces. 

6 The Rabbis declare above that after "for instance, bread of rice or millet" no benediction is necessary, and here they are made to hold the opinion that one benediction, the abstract of three, is required. 

7 I.e. in the quoted Baraita, the reading should be "no benediction is required" not "one benediction which is an abstract of three." 

8 A dish resembling the Habis, consisting of honey, flour and oil. See T. A.J. p. 107. 

===================================================

Page : 251
----------
1 That pieces of bread, the size of an olive, require the benediction "...Who bringest forth bread from the earth." 

2 A non-priest. 

3 The priest. 

4 Cf. Lev. ii. 6. 

5 Since there are no pieces the size of an olive. 

6 I.e. the benediction is unnecessary. 

7 According to Rashi this refers to the cmmbs of the meal-offering. But Tosafot object that this cannot be, because it continaes "should it be leaven"; and the meal-offering must be unleaven. Consequently it is taken to refer to crumbs of different species, each in itself not the size of an olive. 

8 By eating them on Passover. 

9 When it is his duty to eat unleaven. Consequently these crumbs are together considered to be equivalent to a piece of the size of an olive, otherwise he would not be violating the Passover if they were leaven, or fulfil the law of the Passover if unleaven. 

===================================================

Page : 252
----------
1 Therefore we cannot argue from this Baraita to the case under consideration. 

2 I.e. a piece of bread the size of four eggs. The meaning is, he must not spread the eating of the crumbs over a long space of time ; the maximum being the time required to eat half a roll. 

3 Lit. large; i.e. a loaf which has not been entirely reduced to crumbs, but only a part of it. If, then, he eats of these crumbs and they are not the size of an olive, he is not required to say the benediction "...Who bringest forth bread from the earth." 

4 *** which Jastrow considers a corruption of ***, the Latin tracta, "a long piece of dough pulled out in making pastry." So Krauss, p. 274. 

5 M. : Rab Joseph. 

6 M.: is subject to. 

7 Rashi explains: Dough roasted on the spit and covered with oil or eggs and oil. But see T. A. i. p. 107. 

8 According to Rashi: Bread baked in the Sun, not an oven. Jastrow explains : A preserve consisting of sour milk, bread-crusts and salt. See also T. A. I. p. 472 n, 430. 

9 Whether Hallah is necessary. 

10 So that there is the semblance of bread. 

11 I.e. flat boards of dough.

1 He treated it as though it were bread. 

2 Not "...Who createst the fruit of the tree." 

3 Read with M. : *** for ***, the grapes which are left unripened in the winter, from which vinegar is made. 

4 Cf. Lev. V. 15 f. 

5 From the payment of the additional fifth, because he does not regard them as fruit. Mar is therefore in agreement with him. 

6 ***, a brew of pounded groats and spices. What benediction does it need? 

7 Rabina's question caused Raba to understand what had been asked of him. 

8 Flour of unripe barley mixed with honey. 

===================================================

Page : 254
----------

1 M. : Raba. 

2 A brew made from roasted wheat ; cf. Pesahim 42 b. 

3 What becomes of the objection that the Shattit cannot be a remedy since it is not permitted to prepare a remedy on the Sabbath, whereas this may be prepared? 

4 There was nothing more to be done to it to constitute it a remedy ; therefore it may be prepared on the Sabbath, although used as a remedy. 

5 Respecting the correct benediction for the Shattit. 

6 Even if eaten as food. 

7 I.e. with the definite article omitted. It is noteworthy that in the other benedictions there is no article. A difference in tense-meaning is here associated with its inclusion or omission. 

8 Not hammosi' otam. The words were spoken by Balaam and refer to a past event. 

===================================================
Page : 255
----------
1 Accordingly even in Exod. vi. 7 upon which R. Nehemiah relied, hammosi' has the meaning "Who brought forth." 

2 The text is corrupt, and the translation given seems to follow the correct reading; cf. D. S. ad loc. Goldschmidt reads: The Rabbis praised the father of R. Simeon b. Rab Zebid to R. Zera b. Rab. 

3 Of Exod. vi. 7 discussed above. 

4 They give it the sense of the past, because the bread being before the person, it had already been brought forth. I have nevertheless retained the usual rendering "Who bringest forth." 

5 Read: Raba (Hyman iii. p. 1095a).

1 Some authorities omit these words. 

2 I.e. Rab Hisda in order to harmonise these divergent opinions. 

3 Referring to something that is usually eaten raw. 

4 Referring to something that is usually cooked, but is eaten raw. 

5 To eat unleavened bread on Passover. 

6 Accordingly R. Mei'r and Samuel agree that cooking does not alter the original natare of the article. 

7 R. Jose and R. Johanan agree that cooking changes the nature of the article.

1 And cooking makes no difference to the benediction. 

2 The unleavened wafer is exceptional and no general rule can be argued from it. 

3 That vegetables are to be considered as unaffected by cooking for the purpose of the benediction. 

4 Ascribing to R. Johanan the statement that the benediction is "...By Whose word," etc. 

5 I.e. Why mention it at all in view of the contradictory report of a more eminent authority? 

6 Which show that R. Hiyya's version is more trustworthy. 

7 About the benediction. 

8 Proving that, in his opinion, the cooking made no difference to the benediction. 

9 From the standpoint of the benediction, salting is the same as cooking.

1 Singer, p. 290. 

2 M.: Samuel b. Isaac, 

3 Cf. Exod. xii. 8. 

4 No benediction is required unless the amount of food eaten is the size of an olive. If, therefore, one eats only an olive, he has not partaken of the minimum, since the stone has to be removed. 

5 Jastrow adopts the Talmudic derivation which makes this a Hebrew word from the root agr "to store," hence "fit for storage, of good quality." It might, however, be the name of a place; see Neubauer, p. 387, who identifies it with Egra in the interior of Babylon. J. Perles, Zur rabbinischen Sprachund Sagenkunde, p. 34, suggests ***. 

6 M. : Ibrosi which Jastrow thinks is a geographical name. Krauss, p. 7, refers to *** "fresh"; but see Low's criticism ad loc. Perles, op. cit. p. 35, suggests *** ***. 

7 M.: Sibrosi which, according to Jastrow, is a geographical name. Wiesner explains it by the Latin semirudis "half-ripe" [?]. Krauss, p. 399, regards it as another variant of ***. Perles, loc. cit. , reads Imrosi which he identifies with ambrosia.

1 He should first have said the benediction over the fruit as being in its natural state. He gave the poultry the preference, as though it were a new luxury for him. 

2 A sarcastic rebuke. If they did not admit their master's superior knowledge, let them at least defer to his riper experience. 

3 They were punished for disrespect towards their teacher. 

4 After the benediction, he partook of the poultry not the vegetables, although the benediction was the same for both. 

5 I.e. more so than the poultry. 

6 Because the semblance of fruit has gone.

1 An onomatopoeic expression, representing the sound made when the broth is boiling. 

2 For the purpose of the benediction. 

3 Then the benediction would be "...Who createst the fruit of the earth"; if the latter alternative, no benediction would be required. 

4 It is then regarded as merely wood and not as a herb; hence its only use is to impart a flavour to a dish. 

5 M. adds: b. Abba in the name of R. Johanan. 

6 When the bread is soaked, this is impossible. 

7 See p. 74 n. 2. 

8 I.e. when the pieces are larger than the whole loaves.

2 R. Judah. 

3 To receive the Terumah. 

4 In that case, the Terumah would have to be stored until it could be handed to a priest, and the half-onion would decay more quickly than a whole one. 

5 Viz. Rab Huna and R. Johanan. 

6 M.: R. Johanan. 

7 Lit. peaceful. 

8 The poor man usually has to say his benediction over a piece rather than over a whole loaf ; therefore over the unleavened bread, we should use a piece for the benediction. 

9 M.: Raba.

----------
1 Referring to the double portion of manna provided on the Friday for the Sabbath. 

2 Because it is stated "they gathered twice as mach bread," not that they used it all. Hence to hold the two loaves was sufficient. 

3 That of the 'Erub (see Glossary, s.v.). 

4 Saying a benediction. 

5 M.: Rabina. 

6 It is forbidden to speak between the benediction and the performance of the act for which it had been said. But in this case, the words are not considered an interruption to render the benediction invalid. 

7 Because the spoken words were connected with the breaking of the bread, salt being used with the bread over which the benediction is said as salt was required with the meal-offering. Cf. Lev. ii. 13. 

8 The correct reading is probably Rabbah b. Samuel... Hiyya b. Abba; cf, Hyman, ii. p. 438 b.

1 Not waiting for salt. 

2 Being fresh and tasty. 

3 This last word is rendered by Rashi and others "delay" (sc. for salt). But Jastrow establishes the meaning "condiment." 

4 Rashi explains : When standing, he fears his clothes will be splashed and consequently he restrains himself. 

5 M. omits these words here and inserts them after "even when standing." 

6 There is then no cause for this fear, the loose earth absorbing the urine. 

7 Through illness. 

8 I.e. he drinks a large quantity of water at his meal. 

9 That he should not eat lentils every day.

2 She allowed the flavour of the cumin to penetrate into the bread, but would not permit it to remain because the smell was injurious. 

3 M. omits this sentence. 

4 That he requires a special benediction for vegetables and not merely "...Who createst the fruit of the ground." 

5 I.e. a special form of praise for the Sabbath, Passover, etc. 

6 The ignorant. 

7 See Bacher, A. P. A. ii. p. 518 n. 3 who compares Matt xiii. 12 "For whosoever hath, to him shall be given."

9 Add to thy knowledge.

1 Because according to the Mishnah, the benediction "...Who createst the fruit of the ground" is allowed over fruits of the tree. 

2 So that the field lost its fertility. 

3 See Deut. xxvi. 5-10. The declaration concludes with "And now, behold, I have brought the first of the fruit of the land which Thou, O Lord, hast given me." But since the water-supply has ceased or the tree which grew the fruit been cut down, the land will no longer yield him fruits and therefore the declaration ought not to be made. 

4 Since the land remains, he requires the declaration to be made ; accordingly he holds that the ground is the main feature of the tree. 

5 A child reaches the age when it eats bread before it can speak. This is intended to explain the name "tree of knowledge" (Gen. ii. 17).

1 E.g. wheat. 

2 These have special benedictions; see p. 233. 

3 This is valid as a benediction and he may proceed to eat. 

4 Since they both demand the precise benediction. 

5 Who are content so long as praise is offered to God. 

6 If the man had merely said, "Blessed be the All-present Who has created this" and not "this bread," it would not have sufficed for R. Meir. Hence he agrees with Rab Huna who is not satisfied with "...By Whose word," etc. because it makes no mention of the bread. 

7 I.e. break a piece and place salt or relish in between; cf. Lane, p. 148. On the various explanations of the phrase, which is literally "to wrap the bread," see T.A. iii. p. 51.

3 According to Rashi, that means the relish eaten with the bread; but Tosafot explain it to refer to foods like meat, fish, which ordinarily figure in the meal.

4 The wine during the meal is chiefly used for dipping into it. 

5 M. omits "not." 

6 Hence it seems to follow that although a benediction is said over wine brought during the meal, a further benediction is required for the wine brought after the meal. This contradicts Rab Nahman and the others who say "he is exempt. "

3 What answer do they make to Rabban Gamaliel's reason ? 

4 In V. 9. 

5 I.e. V. 10 has no connection with v. 8; therefore one benediction is sufficient. 

6 Why does he not draw the same inference as the Sages? 

7 The reference in v. 9 is to "bread," and according to Rabban Gamaliel, it is inserted lest without it, connecting v. 10 with v. 8, it be thought that even if one chewed wheat in its raw state, he must say the three benedictions. Hence v. 9 is inserted to show that the wheat must be made into "bread" before the benedictions are necessary.
