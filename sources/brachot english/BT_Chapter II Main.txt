MISHNAH I, II 

I. Should a man be reading in the Torah [the section of the Shema'] and the time of reciting the Shema' arrived, if he directed his heart[1], he has fulfilled his obligation. Between the sections, he may greet a man out of respect for him and return a salutation ; but in the middle [of the sections] he may greet a man because of fear for him[2] and return a salutation. These are the words of R. Meir. R. Judah says: In the middle, he may greet a man because of fear for him, and return a salutation out of respect ; and between the sections, he may greet a man out of respect for him and return the salutation of any person. 

II. The following are "between the sections" : Between the first benediction and the second[3] ; between the second and "Hear, O Israel" ; between "Hear, O Israel" and "And it shall come to pass if ye shall hearken" ; between "And it shall come to pass if ye shall hearken" and "And the Lord spake" ; between "And the Lord spake" and "True and firm." R. Judah says : One must make no interruption between "And the Lord spake" and "True and firm." R. Joshua b. Karhah said: Why does the section "Hear, O Israel" precede "And it shall come to pass if ye shall hearken"? So that a man shall first receive upon himself the yoke of the kingdom of heaven, and afterwards receive upon himself the yoke of the commandments. And why does "And it shall came to pass if ye shall hearken" precede "And the Lord spake" ? Because the former applies both during the day and night, but the latter during the day only[4]. 

GEMARA 

Is the conclusion to be drawn [from the opening sentence of the Mishnah] that the performance of the commandments requires Kawwanah[1]? [No; for] what means If he directed his heart to read ? Just to read [in the Torah for the sake of study]. But he was reading[2]! [It is to differentiate him] from one who is reading [the Torah] for the purpose of correcting[3]. 

Our Rabbis have taught : The Shema' must be read as it is written[4]: These are the words of Rabbi[5]; but the Sages say : may be read] in any language[6]. What is Rabbi's reason ? The text states, "And these words shall be" (Deut. vi. 6); i.e. as they are, so must they remain. And what is the reason of the Sages? The text states, "Hear, O Israel" (ibid. v. 4); i.e. in any language which thou hearest. But for Rabbi also it is written "Hear, O Israel[7]" ! He requires it to establish the rule. Cause thine ear to hear what thou utterest with thy lips[8]. And the Sages ? They agree with him who says that if one does not read [the Shema'] audibly, he has still fulfilled his obligation. But for the Sages also it is written "And these words shall be" ! They require it to establish the rule that one must not read [the sentences of the Shema'] out of order. Whence does Rabbi find authority for the rule that the Shema' may not be read out of order[9]? He derives it from the fact that the text states "these words shall be" and not "the words shall be." And the Sages [what do they make of this distinction between "these words" and "the words"]? They draw no conclusion from it at all. It is possible to say that Rabbi holds that the whole Torah can be read in any language. For if thou maintainest that it may be read only in the holy tongue, what are we to make of the phrase "and these words shall be" which the All-merciful wrote? It is necessary because it is written "Hear, O Israel[1]." It is likewise possible to say that the Sages hold that the whole Torah must be read in the holy tongue. For if thou maintainest that it can be read in any language, what are we to make of the phrase "Hear, O Israel" which the All-merciful wrote? It is necessary because it is written "And these words shall be." 

Our Rabbis have taught : "And these words shall be" means that one must not recite [the sentences of the Shema'] out of order. "These words... upon thine heart" — one might suppose that the whole Parashah requires Kawwanah; therefore there is a teaching to state, "These words... [shall be upon thine heart]," that is to say, up to this point Kawwanah is required, but from this point onward it is not necessary. These are the words of R. Eliezer. [[fol. 13 b.]] R. 'Akiba said to him : Behold it states, "Which I command thee this day... upon thine heart." Hence thou learnest that the whole Parashah requires Kawwanah ! Rabbah b. Bar Hannah said in the name of R. Johanan: The Halakah is in accord with R. 'Akiba. 

There are some who connect [the statement of Rabbah b. Bar Hannah] with the following. There is a teaching : Who recites the Shema' must direct his heart thereto. R. Aha[2] says in the name of R. Judah : If one directed his heart in the first paragraph, it is no longer necessary [in the succeeding paragraphs]. Rabbah b. Bar Hannah said in the name of R. Johanan : The Halakah is in accord with the view of R. Aha which he reported in the name of R. Judah. 

There is a further teaching: "And these words... shall be" means one must not read [the sentences of the Shema'] out of order. "Upon thine heart" — R. Zotra[3] says: Up to here[4] the law of Kawwanah applies, but from here onward the commandment to recite applies. R. Josiah[5] says : Up to here the commandment to recite applies, but from here onward the law requiring Kawwanah applies. What is the distinction that from here onward the commandment to recite applies ? Because it is written, "talking of them[1]." But in the first Parashah it is likewise written "and shalt talk of them" ! What he means to say is, Up to here the law of Kawwanah and reciting applies, but from here onward, reciting without Kawwanah is sufficient. And what is the distinction that up to [the end of the first paragraph] the law of Kawwanah and reciting applies ? Because it is written "upon thine heart" and "and shalt talk of them." But in the next paragraph it is likewise written "Upon your heart" and "talking of them" ! That is required for that which R. Isaac said : "Therefore shall ye lay up these My words upon your heart" (Deut. xi. 18) is necessary [to teach that the Tefillin] must be placed over against the heart[2]. 

The teacher stated above : "R. Josiah says : Up to here the commandment to recite applies, but from here onward the law requiring Kawwanah applies." What is the distinction that from here onward the law requiring Kawwanah applies ? Because it is written "upon your heart." But in the first Parashah it is likewise written "upon thine heart" ! What he means to say is, Up to here the law of reciting and Kawwanah applies, but from here onward Kawwanah without reciting is sufficient. And what is the distinction that up to [the end of the first paragraph] the law of reciting and Kawwanah applies ? Because it is written "upon thine heart" and "thou shalt talk of them." But in the next paragraph it is likewise written "upon your heart" and "talking of them"! That refers to the words of Torah[3]; and thus spake the All-merciful, "Teach your children Torah so that they can read therein." 

Our Rabbis have taught : "Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one" (Deut. vi. 4) — up to here Kawwanah[4] is required. These are the words of R. Meir. Raba said : The Halakah is in accord with R. Meir. There is a teaching : Symmachus[1] says : Whoever prolongs the pronunciation of the word ehad "one[2]," his days and years are prolonged for him. Rab Aha b. Jacob said : Especially the letter D. Rab Ashe said: Only he must not slur over the letter H. R. Jeremiah was sitting in the presence of R. Hiyya b. Abba[3], and noticed that he prolonged [the word ehad] exceedingly. He said to him : So long as thou hast proclaimed His Kingship above and below and the four winds of heaven[4], more than that is not required of thee. 

Rab Nathan b. Mar 'Ukba said in the name of Rab Judah : "Upon thine heart" [should be recited] standing. Dost thou imagine that applies only to the words "Upon thine heart"? No ; but say, [From the commencement of the Shema'] up to "upon thine heart" is to be recited standing, but not from there onward. R. Johanan said : The whole paragraph should be recited standing ; and R. Johanan hereby follows out his opinion [expressed in the statement ;] Rabbah b. Rab Hannah said in the name of R. Johanan : The Halakah is in accord with the view of R. Aha which he reported in the name of R. Judah[5]. 

Our Rabbis have taught[6]: "Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one" — that was the reading of the Shema' of R. Judah ha-Nasi'. Rab said to R. Hiyya, "I have never seen Rabbi receive the yoke of the kingdom of heaven upon himself[7]." He replied to him, "Son of princes[8], at the time when he passed his hands across his face[1], he received upon himself the yoke of the kingdom of heaven." Did he afterwards finish the Shema' or did he not? Bar Kappara says : He did not afterwards finish it. R. Simeon b. Rabbi Says : He did afterwards finish it. Bar Kappara said to R. Simeon b. Rabbi ; It is quite right according to me when I declare he did not afterwards finish it, because Rabbi used [every day] to deal with a theme in which the exodus from Egypt was mentioned[2]; but according to thee who sayest that he did afterwards finish it, why did he [daily] deal with such a theme? [He replied] : For the purpose of mentioning the exodus from Egypt in its proper time[3]. 

R. Ila[4] b. Rab Samuel b. Marta said in the name of Rab: [If one recited only the verse] "Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one" and was then overcome by sleep, he has fulfilled his obligation. Rab Nahman[5] said to Daro his servant : With the first verse worry me [to keep awake], but do not so after that. Rab Joseph asked Rab Joseph b. Raba[6], "How used thy father to do ?" He replied, "With the first verse he took pains [to keep awake], but he did not so after that." 

Rab Joseph said : One who lies on his back should not read the Shema'. Is it only he may not read [the Shema' in this position] ; but is it right for him to sleep [in this position]? For lo, R. Joshua b. Levi cursed anyone who slept lying on his back[7] ! They answered : To sleep thus is right if he incline a little to one side, but to read the Shema' is forbidden, though he incline to one side. But R. Johanan inclined to one side and read the Shema' ! It is different with him, because he was corpulent. 

Between the sections he may greet a man out of respect for him and return a salutation. 

He may return a salutation ; but on what ground ? If it is supposed out of respect, since he is allowed to greet, surely he ought to be permitted to respond ! But [the meaning is], He greets a man out of respect, and returns a salutation to any person. Consider the sequel : In the middle [of the sections] he may greet a man because of fear for him and return the salutation. On what ground may he respond ? If it is supposed because of fear, since he is allowed to greet, surely he ought to be permitted to respond ! But [the meaning is. He may return the salutation] out of respect. But that is the view of. R. Judah[1]! For our Mishnah states: R. Judah says : In the middle of a section, he may greet a man because of fear for him and return a salutation out of respect ; and between the sections, he may greet a man out of respect and return the salutation of any person! [The text of the Mishnah] is defective and should read thus : "Between the sections, he may greet a man out of respect for him, and there is no need to state that he may return the salutation ; and in the middle [of the sections], he may greet a man because of fear for him, and there is no need to state that he may return a salutation. These are the words of R. Meir. R. Judah says : In the middle, he may greet [[fol. 14a.]] because of fear and return a salutation out of respect; and between the sections he may greet out of respect and return the salutation of any person." 

There is a teaching to the same effect : If one is reading the Shema', and his teacher or one greater than himself meet him, between the sections he may greet him out of respect, and there is no need to state that he may return a salutation; and in the middle [of the sections], he may greet one because of fear, and there is no need to state that he may return a salutation. These are the words of R. Meir. R. Judah says : In the middle, he may greet because of fear and return a salutation out of respect ; and between the sections, he may greet out of respect and return the salutation of any person.
 
Ahi, a Tanna of the school of R. Hiyya, asked R. Hiyya : May one interrupt the Hallel or the Megillah [to greet a person] ? Do we argue a fortiori : If with the reading of the Shema', which is an ordinance of the Torah, one may interrupt, how much more so should it be permitted in the case of the Hallel or the Megillah[2], which is only a Rabbinical ordinance ! Or is it perhaps that the proclamation of a miracle[3] is superior [to the reading of the [Shema'] ? He replied : One may interrupt, and there is nothing in that [point you raise]. 

Rabbah' said : On those days when the individual[2] completes the Hallel, he may interrupt between the paragraphs, but in the middle of a paragraph he may not interrupt ; and on the days when the individual does not complete the Hallel[3], he may interrupt even in the middle of a paragraph. But it is not so ! For behold, Raba b. Rab Shaba[4] visited Rabina[5] on one of those days when the individual does not[6] complete the Hallel, and Rabina did not interrupt [to greet him]! It is different with Raba b. Shaba, since he was not highly esteemed by Rabina. 

Ashyan[7], a Tanna of the school of R. Ammi, asked R. Ammi : May one who is undergoing a fast[8] taste anything? If he has taken upon himself [to abstain from] eating and drinking, it comes under the heading of neither ; or is it that he has taken upon himself [to abstain from] any kind of gratification, and [tasting] is to be so regarded? He replied : He may taste and there is nothing in that [point you raise]. There is a teaching to the same effect : A woman who tastes [her cooking] is not required to utter a benediction, and she who is undergoing a fast may taste and there is nothing in it. What is the maximum quantity [he may taste]? R. Ammi and R. Assi tasted up to a fourth [of a log]. 

Rab said : Whoever greets his neighbour before he prays[9] is as though he accounted him as an idolatrous altar [bamah][10] ; as it is said, "Cease ye from man, in whose nostrils is a breath[11] ; for how little [bammeh] is he to be accounted" (Is. ii. 22). Read not bammeh but bamah[1]. But Samuel said[2] : Why do you esteem this person [whom you greet first] and not God ? Rab Sheshet[3] quoted the following in objection ; Between the sections one may greet out of respect and return a salutation[4] ! R. Abba explained [the statements of Rab Samuel to refer] to one who goes first to the door of his neighbour[5]. 

R. Jonah said in the name of R. Zera: Whoever attends to his personal affairs before offering his prayers is as though he had erected an idolatrous altar. He was asked : Dost thou say "an idolatrous altar"? He answered : No, I only mean it is prohibited[6]; and it is in accordance with the statement of Rab Iddi b. Abin who said in the name of Rab Isaac b. Ashyan : It is forbidden a man to attend to his personal affairs before offering his prayers ; as it is said, "Righteousness shall go before him[7], and shall make his footsteps a way" (Ps. Ixxxv. 14). Rab Iddi b. Abin also said in the name of Rab Isaac b. Ashyan : Whoever prays and afterwards goes on his way [to attend to his affairs], the Holy One, blessed be He, attends to them for him ; as it is said, "Righteousness shall go before him, and He shall make his footsteps a way." 

R. Jonah also said in the name of R. Zera : Whoever sleeps for seven nights without a dream is called evil[8]; as it is said, "He shall abide satisfied [sabea'] he shall not he visited with evil" (Prov. xix. 23). Read not sabea', but sheba' "seven[9]." R. Abba[10], son of R. Hiyya b. Abba, said to him : Thus declared R. Hiyya[11] in the name of R. Johanan : Whoever satisfies[12] himself with words of Torah and then sleeps will not receive evil tidings [in a dream]; as it is said, "He shall abide satisfied [with Torah], he shall not be visited with evil." 

The following are between the sections, etc. 

R. Abbahu said in the name of R. Johanan : The Halakah is in accord with R. Judah who maintains that one may not interrupt between "I am the Lord your God" and "True and firm[1]." R. Abbahu [also] said in the name of R. Johanan: What is R. Judah's reason? Because it is written, "The Lord God is the true God" (Jer. x. 10). Should one repeat the word "true" or not[2]? R. Abbahu said in the name of R. Johanan: He must repeat the word "true." Rabbah[3] said : He does not repeat it. Somebody descended[4] in the presence of Rabbah ; and when the latter heard him say emit "true" twice, he exclaimed, "Every emet has seized hold of this fellow !" 

Rab Joseph said : How excellent is the teaching which, when Rab Samuel b. Judah came [from Palestine], he reported, viz. : In the West they say in the evening, "Speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them I am the Lord your God. True[5]." Abbai said to him : What is there excellent in this? Behold, Rab Kahana has said in the name of Rab : One need not commence [the third paragraph at all] ; but if he has commenced it, he must finish it ! Shouldest thou argue that [to say the words] "And thou shalt say unto them" is not commencing[6], behold Rab Samuel b. Isaac has declared in the name of Rab[7] : "Speak unto the children of Israel" is not considered a commencement, but "And thou shalt say unto them" is to be so regarded ! Rab Pappa replied : In the West they hold that "And thou shalt say unto them" is likewise not considered a commencement, until one adds "And they shall make for themselves fringes." Abbai said : Therefore we[1] commence as they commence in the West, and since we have commenced, we also complete it ; for Rab Kahana said in the name of Rab : One need not commence it ; but if he has commenced it, he must finish it. 

Hiyya b. Rab declared.: If one has said "I am the Lord your God," he must continue "True" ; if he has not said "I am the Lord your God," it is not necessary to add "True[2]." Yes; but he is required to mention the exodus from Egypt[3]! Let him say the following : "We give thanks unto Thee, O Lord our God, that Thou hast brought us forth from the land of Egypt and redeemed us from the house of bondage, and performed miracles and mighty deeds for us by the Red Sea ; to thee do we sing[4]." 

R. Joshua b. Karhah said: Why does the section "Hear O Israel" precede "And it shall come to pass if ye shall hearken"?

There is a teaching : R. Simeon b. Johai says : It is right that precedence should be given to "Hear O Israel" over "And it shall come to pass," because the former speaks of learning, the latter of teaching; and to "It shall come to pass" over "And the Lord spake," because the former speaks of teaching[5] and the latter of performing. Do you mean to say that in "Hear O Israel" there is a reference to learning, but not to teaching and performing? Behold it is written, "Thou shalt teach them diligently... thou shalt bind them... thou shalt write them"! And further [do you mean to say that] "And it shall come to pass" contains a reference to teaching, but not to performing? Behold it is written, "Ye shall bind... ye shall write"! Nay; but this is what he means to say : It is right that precedence should be given to "Hear O Israel" over "And it shall come to pass," because the former contains a reference to learning, teaching and performing ; and to "And it shall come to pass" over "And the Lord spake," because the former contains a reference to teaching and performing, whereas "And the Lord spake" refers only to performing. But derive the reason [for the order of the paragraphs] from the statement of R. Joshua b. Karhah[6]! [He gave] one reason and now another is added; viz. : [the first is] in order that a man shall first receive upon himself the yoke of the kingdom of heaven and afterwards receive upon himself the yoke of the commandments ; and the second reason is because the first paragraph contains these other references. 

Rab washed his hands, read the Shema', put on the Tefillin and then offered his prayers. How could he act thus[1]? For lo, there is a teaching : One who is digging a cavity for a corpse[2] is exempt from the obligation of reading the Shema', the Tefillah, Tefillin and all the commandments mentioned in the Torah[3] ; but when the time of reading the Shema' arrives, he ascends, washes his hands, puts on the Tefillin, reads the Shema' and offers his prayers? Here is a self-contradiction ! The first clause declares such a man to be exempt from the obligation, and the latter imposes the obligation upon him ! There is no contradiction : the latter clause referring to where there are two[4], the former to one. Nevertheless it presents a difficulty to Rab. [The solution is :] Rab holds the view of R. Joshua b. Karhah who says : First there must be the yoke of the kingdom of heaven, and afterwards the yoke of the commandments[5]. R. Joshua b. Karhah certainly said that the reading [of the yoke of heaven, i.e. "Hear O Israel"] is to precede the reading [of the yoke of the commandments, i.e. "And it shall come to pass"] ; but hast thou heard him say that the reading [of the Shema'] should precede the performance [of the duty of Tefillin] ? Further, how could Rab be considered as holding the same opinion as R. Joshua b. Karhah ? For Rab Hiyya b. Ashe has said : On many occasions have I stood before Rab[6], who first washed his hands, uttered the benediction[7], taught us the chapters, laid Tefillin, and after that read the Shema' ! Shouldest thou argue that the time for reading the Shema' had not yet arrived, in that case what purpose is there in the testimony of Rab Hiyya b. Ashe? [The object was] to refute him who declared that it is unnecessary to utter a benediction over the study of the Mishnah ; hence we are informed that likewise for the Mishnah it is necessary to utter a benediction[1]. Still the difficulty against Rab remains! His messenger was at fault[2]. 

'Ulla said : Whoever reads the Shema' without Tefillin is as though he spoke false testimony against himself[3]. R. Hiyya b. Abba said in the name of R. Johanan : It is as though he had offered a burnt-offering without a meal-offering (cf. Num. xxviii. 5) and a sacrifice without drink-offerings (ibid. v. 14). 

[[fol. 15a.]] R. Johanan also said[4]: Whoever wishes to receive upon himself the yoke of the kingdom of heaven in perfection should first have evacuation[5], then wash his hands, lay Tefillin, read the Shema' and offer his prayers — that is receiving the kingdom of heaven in perfection. R. Hiyya b. Abba said in the name of R. Johanan : Whoever has evacuation, washes his hands, lays Tefillin, reads the Shema' and offers his prayers, the Scriptures ascribe it to him as though he had erected an altar and brought a sacrifice thereon ; as it is written, "I will wash my hands in cleanliness ; so will I compass Thine altar, O Lord" (Ps. xxvi. 6). Rabbah[6] said to him : Does not the master think that it is as though he had bathed his whole body[7]? [Yes]; for it is written, "I will wash [in cleanliness][8]" not simply "I will cause [mine hands] to be washed." 

Rabina said to Raba[1] : Has the master seen the Rabbinical scholar who has come from the West and said, "Who has no water wherewith to wash his hands should rub them with earth or pebbles or sawdust[2]"? He answered : Well has he spoken ; for is it written, "I will wash with water"? No; it is written, "I will wash in cleanliness," i.e. with anything that cleanses. And lo, Rab Hisda cursed anyone who went about in search of water at the time of prayer[3]. This, however, applies only to the reading of the Shema', but for the Tefillah one may go for water[4]. How far may one go for it ? A Parsah. But this applies only in front of him ; in the rear he may not go even a Mil, [from which it is to be deduced] he may not go in the rear a Mil, but less than that distance is permissible. 

MISHNAH III 

Who reads the Shema' without making it audible to his ear has complied with the requirements of the law[5]. R. Jose says : He has not so complied. If he read it without distinctly pronouncing its letters — R. Jose says : He has complied with the requirements of the law ; but R. Judah says : He has not. If one reads it in the wrong order of its paragraphs, he has not complied with the requirements of the law. If one has read it but made a mistake, he returns to the place where he erred. 

GEMARA 

What is R. Jose's reason [for declaring that unless the Shema' is read audibly the requirements of the law have not been fulfilled]? Because it is written, "Hear O Israel," i.e. let thine ear hear what thou issuest from thy mouth. And the first Tanna[6] ? He holds that "Hear" [means that the Shema' may be read] in any language which thou hearest. And R. Jose [ — where does he find a basis in the Torah for this regulation] ? Both are to be derived from the word "Hear." We have learnt elsewhere in the Mishnah : A deaf man who speaks but cannot hear may not separate the Terumah[1] ; but if he has done so, his Terumah is valid. Who is the authority for the teaching : [The Terumah separated by] a deaf man who speaks but cannot hear is post factum valid, but not ab initio[2]? Rab Hisda said : It is R. Jose ; because we have learnt in our Mishnah : Who reads the Shema' without making it audible to his ear has complied with the requirements of the law. These are the words of R. Judah[3]. R. Jose says: He has not so complied. Only in the matter of the reading of the Shema', which is an ordinance of the Torah, does R. Jose say that the man has not fulfilled his obligation ; but in the matter of Terumah [the deaf man would have fulfilled it], because it is a question of saying the benediction and the saying of the benediction is ordained by the Rabbis, and [the validity of the Terumah] is not dependent upon the benediction[4]. 

But how [do we know that the teaching in the quoted Mishnah] is R. Jose's? Perhaps it is R. Judah's, and he means to say with reference also to the reading of the Shema' that having read it inaudibly he has complied with the requirements of the law, but ab initio he should not read it so ? Thou mayest find proof for this in the fact that he states Who reads[5] [the Shema' without making it audible], i.e. post factum it is valid, but not ab initio ! They answer that the fact that our Mishnah states Who reads is intended to show how extreme is the view of R. Jose, for he means to say that even post factum it is not valid; since were it R. Judah, even ab initio it would still be valid. 

Having demonstrated that [the Mishnah about Terumah] is in accord with R. Jose, what, however, of the following ? There is a teaching: A man must not say the Grace after meals in his heart [inaudibly] ; but if he has done so, he has fulfilled his obligation. Whose view is this? It can be neither R. Jose's nor R. Judah's. For were it R. Judah's, if the man had said [Grace inaudibly] ab initio he would also have fulfilled his duty ; if R. Jose's, even post factum it cannot be considered that he has done so[1]. How is it then? It must be R. Judah's, and [his opinion is] post factum it is allowed, but not ab initio. 

What, however, of the following? R. Judah, the son of R. Simeon b. Pazzi, taught : A deaf person who can speak but cannot hear may separate the Terumah ab initio. In accordance with whose view is this ? It can be neither R. Judah's nor R. Jose's. If R. Judah's, he permits it post factum, but not ab initio; if R. Jose's, he does not allow it even post factum. It is certainly in agreement with R. Judah, even though it be ab initio ; and there is no contradiction[2]. The latter[3] is his own opinion, the other[4] the opinion of his teacher. For there is a teaching[5] : R. Judah says in the name of R. Eleazar b. 'Azariah : When one reads the Shema' he must make it audible to his ear ; as it is said, "Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one" (Deut. vi. 4). R. Meir said to him : Behold the Scriptures state, "And these words which I command thee this day shall be upon thy heart" (ibid. v. 6), i.e. the words depend on the Kawwanah of the heart[6]. Since thou hast reached so far[7], thou mayest even suppose that R. Judah agrees with his teacher's opinion, and there is no contradiction, one being R. Meir's view[8] and the other R. Judah's[9]. 

We have learnt elsewhere in the Mishnah : All are fit and proper persons to read the Megillah, except a deaf person, a mentally defective, and a minor[1]. R. Judah allows a minor to read. Who is the authority for the teaching that if a deaf person has read it[2], his recital is even post factum invalid? Rab Mattenah declared that it is R. Jose ; for we have learnt in our Mishnah : Who reads the Shema' without making it audible to his ear has complied with the requirements of the law. These are the words of R. Judah. R. Jose says: He has not so complied. How can we know that [this quoted Mishnah] is R. Jose's view [and means that the reading of the Megillah by a deaf person] is also invalid post factum ; [[fol. 15b.]] perhaps it is R. Judah's view and ab initio it is not permitted, but post factum it is valid ? This cannot enter thy mind ; because the Mishnah refers to a deaf person exactly as to the mentally defective and minor ; and therefore, as in the case of a mentally defective and minor even post factum [the reading of the Megillah] is invalid, so also if a deaf person has read it, it is likewise invalid. But perhaps the two have to be kept distinct[3]! Still thou canst not possibly maintain that it is in accord with R. Judah ; because from what is stated in the sequel, "R. Judah allows a minor to read [the Megillah]" it is to be inferred that the first part is not R. Judah's view ! But perhaps the whole of it is R. Judah's view, there being two kinds of "minor," and [the wording of the Mishnah] is defective and should read thus : "All are fit and proper persons to read the Megillah except a deaf person, a mentally defective person and a minor. Of whom does this speak ? Of a minor who has not yet reached Initiation[4]; but a minor who has reached Initiation is fit to read it even ab initio. These are the words of R. Judah, for R. Judah permits a minor to read." 

Having demonstrated that [the Mishnah about the reading of the Megillah] is in accord with R. Judah and post factum it is permissible, but not ab initio, what, however, of the teaching of R. Judah, the son of R. Simeon b. Pazzi : A deaf person who speaks but cannot hear may separate the Terumah ab initio ? Whose view is that? It cannot be R. Judah's, nor R. Jose's. If R. Judah's, post factum it should be allowed, but not ab initio; if R. Jose's, even post factum it should be invalid. Whose view is it then ? R. Judah's and even ab initio it is permissible. 

What, however, of the following ? There is a teaching : A man must not say Grace after meals in his heart ; but if he has done so, he has complied with the requirements of the law. Whose view is that ? It is not R. Judah's, nor R. Jose's. If R. Judah's, he would allow that to act thus ab initio likewise complies with the requirements of the law ; if R. Jose's, even post factum it is not valid. It is certainly R. Judah's view, and even ab initio it is valid. Nor is there any contradiction[1] ; the latter[2] being R. Judah's own opinion, the other that of his teacher[3]. For there is a teaching : R. Judah says in the name of R. Eleazar b. 'Azariah : He who reads the Shema' must make it audible to his ear ; as it is said, "Hear O Israel." R. Meir said to him : Behold the Scriptures state, "And these words which I command thee this day shall be upon thy heart," i.e. the words depend upon the Kawwanah of the heart. Since thou hast reached so far, thou mayest even suppose that R. Judah agrees with his teacher's opinion ; and there is no contradiction, one being R. Judah's view, the other R. Meir's[4]. 

Rab Hisda said in the name of Rab Shela[5]: The Halakah is in accord with R. Judah's view which he reported in the name of R. Eleazar b. 'Azariah, and the Halakah is in accord with R. Judah. It is necessary [to state it in this way] ; for if he had informed us only that the Halakah is in accord with R. Judah, I might have supposed [the Shema' need not be read audibly] ab initio ; therefore he tells us that the Halakah is in accord with R. Judah's view which he reported in the name of R. Eleazar b. 'Azariah[6]. And if he had informed us only that the Halakah is in accord with R. Judah's view which he reported in the name of R. Eleazar b. 'Azariah, I might have supposed that it is essential [for the Shema' to be read audibly ab initio] and there was no rectification [if this had not been done]. Therefore he informs us that the Halakah is in accord with R. Judah[7]. 

Rab Joseph said : The dispute is only over the reading of the Shema', but with other commandments[1] all agree that [if inaudible] he has not complied with the requirements of the law ; for it is written, "Attend and hear, O Israel" (Deut. xxvii. 9). But it is quoted in objection : One may not say the Grace after meals in his heart ; but if he has done so, he has complied with the requirements of the law ! But if [the statement of Rab Joseph] was reported, it must have been reported as follows : The dispute is only over the reading of the Shema' ; for it is written, "Hear O Israel" ; but with other commandments all agree that [if inaudible] he has complied with the requirements of the law. But it is written, "Attend and hear, O Israel[2]" ! That refers to reading the Scriptures[3]. 

If he had read it without distinctly pronouncing its letters. 

R. Tabi said in the name of R. Josiah : The Halakah is in accord with the more lenient view in both instances[4]. 

R. Tabi also said in the name of R. Josiah : What means that which is written, "There are three things that are never satisfied... the grave, and the barren womb," etc. (Prov, xxx. 15 f.) — what is the connection between "the grave" and "the barren womb"? Its intention is to tell thee that as the womb receives and yields up, so the grave receives and yields up. And may we not use the a fortiori argument ? As the womb receives [the seed] in silence and yields up [the child] with loud cries, how much more so will the grave, which receives [the body] with loud cries [of lament], yield up with loud cries ! Hence a refutation of those who assert that the resurrection of the dead is not taught in the Torah[5]. 

Rab Josiah[6] taught in the presence of Raba : "And thou shalt write them" (Deut. vi. 9) means that the whole [of the first two paragraphs of the Shema'] must be written [in the Tefillin], even the words of the commands[7]. Raba said to him : Should one ask thee whose teaching this is, it is R. Judah's; for he stated with reference to the woman suspected of adultery : One writes the curses but not the words of the command, because in this connection it is written, "And the priests shall write these curses in a scroll" (Num. v. 23), but here [in connection with Tefillin] it is written, "And thou shalt write them," i.e. even the words of the command. Dost thou suppose that R. Judah's reason is because the text states, "[And the priest] shall write"? His reason is because the text states, "[And the priest shall write] these curses," i.e. the curses shall be written, but not the words of the command. It is necessary [to mention this point] ; because it might have entered thy mind that I mean we can draw an analogy from the use of the verb "to write" in the former instance, thus : As there [with reference to the woman suspected of adultery] the curses were to be written and not the words of the command, so here likewise [with the Tefillin] the words of the command were not to be written[1]! Therefore the All-merciful wrote, "And thou shalt write them" i.e. even the words of the command. 

Rab Obadiah taught in the presence of Raba : "And ye shall teach" (Deut. xi. 19), i.e. let thy teaching be perfect[2] — let one make a brief pause between words which are liable to be jumbled together[3], Raba added to this observation : For instance 'al lebabeka "upon thy heart" ; 'al lebabekem "upon your heart" ; bekol lebabeka "with all thy heart" ; bekol lebabekem "with all your heart" ; 'eseb besadeka "grass in thy field" ; wa'abadtem meherah "and ye will perish speedily" ; hakkanaph petil "the corner, a thread" ; etkem me'eres "you from the land[4]." 

R. Hamma b. R. Hannina said : Whoever reads the Shema' with distinct pronunciation of its letters, Gehinnom is cooled for him ; as it is said, "When the Almighty scattereth kings therein, it snoweth in Zalmon" (Ps. Ixviii. 15). Read not bephares "[When the Almighty] scattereth," but read bepharesh "When one uttereth [the name of the Almighty] distinctly" ; and read not beZalmon "in Zalmon," but besalmawet "in the shadow of death[1]." 

R. Hamma b. R. Hannina also said : Why are there found associated "tents" and "streams" — for it is written, "As streams [[fol. 16 a.]] stretched out, as gardens by the river-side, as tents[2] planted by the Lord, as cedars beside the waters" (Num. xxiv. 6)[3]? Its intention is to tell thee that as streams bring a man up from impurity to purity, so do "tents" bring a man up from the scale of guilt to the scale of merit. 

If one read it in the wrong order of its paragraphs, he has not complied with the requirements of the law. 

R. Ammi and R. Assi were once decorating the bridal-chamber for R.Eleazar. He said to them, "In the meanwhile I will go and listen to the teaching in the House of Study, and will come back and report it to you." He went and found a Tanna expounding in the presence of R. Johanan: Should one have read the Shema' and erred without knowing for certain where he made the mistake, if this occurred in the middle of the first paragraph he must return to the commencement ; if between two paragraphs, he must return to the first of them ; if between "and thou shalt write them" and "ye shall write them[4]," he must return to the first. R. Johanan said to him : This latter only applies if he has not started "That your days may be multiplied" ; but should he have commenced that sentence, [he may assume that] he followed on from force of habit[5]. [R. Eleazar] returned and reported it to them. They said to him : "If we had come for nothing else than to hear this, it would be sufficient for us." 

MISHNAH IV, V 

IV. Workmen may read the Shema' on the top of a tree or on top of scaffolding, but this they may not do with the Tefillah. 

V. A bridegroom is exempt from the obligation of reading the Shema' on the first night [of his marriage], and until the termination of the ensuing Sabbath, if he has not consummated the marriage. It happened that when Rabban Gamaliel married, he read the Shema' on the first night. His disciples said to him, "Our teacher ! thou hast taught us that a bridegroom is exempt from the obligation of reading the Shema'[1]." He replied, "I will not hearken to you to annul the kingdom of heaven from myself even a single hour." 

GEMARA 

Our Rabbis have taught : Workmen may read [the Shema'] on the top of a tree or on the top of scaffolding. They may likewise say the Tefillah on top of an olive-tree or fig-tree[2] ; but with all other trees they must descend to the ground to say the Tefillah. The employer must in every instance descend to the ground to say the Tefillah, because his mind is not settled[3]. 

Rab Mari, the son of Samuel's daughter[4], asked Raba : Our Mishnah states : Workmen may read [the Shema'] on the top of a tree or on the top of scaffolding ; hence it is to be inferred that it does not require Kawwanah. I quote in refutation[5]: Who reads the Shema' must direct his heart; as it is said, "Hear, O Israel" (Deut. vi. 4) and elsewhere, "Attend and hear, O Israel " (ibid, xxvii. 9) ; as here "attention" is required so also there[6] ! [Raba] remained silent ; so he asked him : Hast thou heard anything on this point ? He replied : Thus said Rab Sheshet[7]: [Kawwanah is demanded of workmen] only if they stop their work to read it. But lo, there is a teaching : Bet Hillel say : Workmen may remain at their work and read it ! There is no contradiction ; the former refers to the first paragraph [of the Shema'], the latter to the second. 

Our Rabbis have taught: Labourers who are working for an employer should read the Shema', say the benedictions before and after, eat their meal with Grace before and after, and then pray the Eighteen Benedictions[1]; but they cannot descend before the Ark[2] nor raise their hands[3]. But lo, there is a teaching: [Such men are to say] an abstract of the Eighteen Benedictions[4]! Rab Sheshet said : There is no contradiction ; the first being Rabban Gamaliel's view, the latter R. Joshua's[5]. If it be R. Joshua's view, why does he mention labourers specially, since it holds good of anybody ? But [we have to assume that] both are Rabban Gamaliel's, and there is no contradiction; the latter treating of one who works for a wage[6], the former of one who works for his keep. And so there is a teaching : Labourers who are working for an employer should read the Shema' say the Tefillah, then eat their meal, but should not say Grace before it[7], only two benedictions after it. How is this meant[8]? The first benediction as ordained[9]; the second commences with the benediction of "the land," and they include "Who... rebuildest Jerusalem" in the benediction of "the land[10]." To whom does this apply ? To those who work for a wage ; but should they work for their keep or their employer take his meals with them[11], they say the [entire] Grace after meals as ordained. 

A bridegroom is exempt from the obligation of reading the Shema'. 

Our Rabbis have taught : "When thou sittest in thy house" (Deut. vi. 7) excludes one occupied with a religious duty ; "and when thou walkest by the way" (ibid.) excludes a bridegroom. Hence they say : He who takes a virgin to his house as wife is exempt ; but if he marry a widow, he has that obligation. How is that demonstrated ? Rab Pappa said : Because [the text uses the word] "way" [we argue]: Just as the way is voluntary, so all is voluntary[1]. 

Are we not here dealing with one who is on his way to perform a religious duty, and even so the All-merciful requires of him the reading [of the Shema'] ? In that case, the All-merciful should have written "when walking." What means "when thou walkest"? Deduce from this, [it means] when walking for thine own purpose thou art under the obligation [to read the Shema'] ; but when it is the performance of a religious duty, thou art exempt. If so, [[fol. 16 b.]] why especially mention, "He who takes a virgin to his house as wife" ? Even one who takes a widow to wife should also [be exempt] ! The man [who marries a virgin] is anxious ; the other is not. Should the reason [of exemption] be on account of anxiety, then it ought to apply also to one whose ship has sunk at sea ! Why, then, does R. Abba b. Zabda declare in the name of Rab : A mourner is under the obligation to observe all the commandments mentioned in the Torah except Tefillin, because they are called an adornment; as it is said, "Bind thine adornment upon thee" (Ezek. xxiv. 17)? The answer is : [There is a difference] ;. the latter being troubled by anxiety of some voluntary matter, whereas the former has anxiety in connection with a religious duty. 


MISHNAH VI — VIII 

VI. [Rabban Gamaliel] bathed on the first night of his wife's death. His disciples said to him, "Our master! Thou hast taught us[2] that a mourner is forbidden to bathe !" He replied, "I am not like other men ; I am in delicate health." 

VII. When his slave, Tabi, died, lie accepted condolence on his behalf. His disciples said to him, "Our master ! Thou hast taught us that one may not accept condolence on the death of slaves" ! He replied, "My slave, Tabi, was not like other slaves; he was a worthy man." 

VIII. If a bridegroom wishes to read the Shema' on the first night [of his marriage], he may do so. Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel says : "Not everybody who wishes to assume the name[1] may do so." 

GEMARA 

What was Rabban Gamaliel's reason[2]? He was of the opinion that the application of the laws of mourning in the night is a Rabbinical injunction; for it is written, "And the end thereof as a bitter day" (Amos viii. 10)[3]; and in the case of a person in delicate health, the Rabbis do not so decree. 

When his slave, Tabi, died, etc. 

Our Rabbis have taught : [At the burial of] male and female slaves, we do not stand in a row[4] for them, nor do we pronounce over them the benediction of mourners[5] and the condolence of mourners[6]. It happened that R. Eliezer's female slave died and his disciples went in to comfort him. When he saw them, he ascended to an upper room, but they ascended after him. He went into the court-way[7], but they went after him. He entered the guest-chamber, but they entered after him. He said to them : I imagined you would be scalded with tepid water[8]; but now you are not scalded even with hot water. Have I not taught you : [On the death of] male and female slaves, we do not stand in a row for them, nor do we pronounce over them the benediction of mourners and the condolence of mourners? What, however, do we say over them ? As we say to a man on the death of his ox or ass, "May the Omnipresent repair thy loss," so do we say to a man on the death of his slaves, "May the Omnipresent repair thy loss." 

There is a further teaching : We do not speak a funeral oration over male and female slaves. R. Jose said : If he was a worthy man, we say of him, "Alas, the good and faithful man who derived pleasure from his work !" They said to him, "In that case, what hast thou left to be said over worthy men [who are not slaves][1]?" 

Our Rabbis have taught : We restrict the name "Patriarch" to three[2], and "Matriarch" to four[3]. Why is the name "Patriarch" [restricted to three][4]? Is it because we are not certain whether we are descended from Reuben or Simeon ? If so, in the case of the Matriarchs we are not certain whether we are descended from Rachel or Leah ! But up to here they were esteemed sufficiently [to be called "Patriarchs"] ; their successors were not so esteemed. 

There is a further teaching : We do not call male and female slaves "Father so-and-so" or "Mother so-and-so." But Rabban Gamaliel's [slaves] used to be called in this manner. This is an actual fact to upset [the teaching just quoted] ! [No; it is different with them,] because they were highly esteemed. 

R. Eleazar said : What means that which is written, "So will I bless Thee as long as I live ; in Thy name will I lift up my hands" (Ps. Ixiii. 5)? "So will I bless Thee as long as I live" refers to the reading of the Shema' ; "in Thy name will I lift up my hands" refers to Tefillah. If one act thus, of him the text saith, "My soul is satisfied as with marrow and fatness" (ibid. v. 6) ; and not only that, but he will inherit two worlds, this world and the world to come, as it is said, "And my mouth will praise Thee with joyful lips" (ibid.)[5]. 

R. Eleazar used to add at the conclusion of his prayer[6] : May it be Thy will, O Lord our God, to cause love and brotherhood, peace and comradeship, to abide in our lot[7], to enlarge our border with disciples, to prosper our goal with a [happy] end and with hope, to set our portion in the Garden of Eden[1], and fortify us with good companionship and the good impulse in Thy universe, so that we rise up and find the longing of our heart to fear Thy name ; and may the satisfaction of our soul come before Thee for good. 

R. Johanan used to add at the conclusion of his prayer: May it be Thy will, O Lord our God, to glance at our shame and look upon our evil plight ; and do Thou clothe Thyself in Thy mercy, cover Thyself with Thy might, enfold Thyself with Thy piety and gird Thyself with Thy grace, and may Thy attribute of goodness and gentleness come before Thee[2]. 

R. Zera used to add at the conclusion of his prayer : May it be Thy will, O Lord our God, that we sin not ; neither may we be put to shame nor be confounded before our fathers. 

R. Hiyya[3] used to add at the conclusion of his prayer : May it be Thy will, O Lord our God, that Thy Torah be our occupation ; and let not our heart grow faint nor our eyes dim. 

Rab used to add at the conclusion of his prayer : May it be Thy will, O Lord our God, to grant us long life, a life of peace, a life of good, a life of blessing, a life of sustenance, a life of bodily vigour, a life marked by the fear of sin, a life free from shame and reproach, a life of prosperity and honour, a life in which the love of Torah and the fear of Heaven shall cleave to us, a life wherein Thou fulfillest all the desires of our heart for good[4]. 

Rabbi used to add at the conclusion of his prayer : May it be Thy will, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, to deliver me from arrogant men and from arrogance, from a bad man, and from any mishap, from the evil impulse, from a bad companion, from a bad neighbour, and from the adversary that destroyeth ; from a hard judgment, and from a hard opponent, whether he be a son of the covenant or be not a son of the covenant[5]. [Thus did Rabbi pray], although eunuchs were standing by him[6]. 

Rab Saphra used to add at the conclusion of his prayer : May it be Thy will, O Lord our God, to grant peace in the household above[1] and the household below, and among the students who [[fol. 17 a.]] occupy themselves with Thy Torah, whether they devote themselves thereto for its own sake or not for its own sake[2]; and as for them that devote themselves thereto not for its own sake, may it be Thy will that they do devote themselves thereto for its own sake. 

R. Alexander used to add at the conclusion of his prayer : May it be Thy will, O Lord our God, to place us in a corner of light and not in a corner of darkness ; and may not our heart grow faint nor our eyes dim. There are some who say this was Rab Hamnuna's prayer ; and R. Alexander used to add at the conclusion of his prayer : Lord of the universe ! It is revealed and known before Thee that it is our will to perform Thy will ; but what stands in the way? The leaven that is in the dough[3] and the servitude of the kingdoms[4]. May it be Thy will to deliver us from their hand[5], so that we may again perform the statutes of Thy will with a perfect heart. 

Raba used to add at the conclusion of his prayer : O my God, before I was formed I was nothing worth, and now that I have been formed I am but as though I had not been formed. Dust am I in my life ; how much more so in my death. Behold I am before Thee like a vessel filled with shame and confusion. O may it be Thy will, O Lord my God, that I may sin no more; and as to the sins I have committed, purge them away in Thine abounding compassion though not by means of affliction and sore diseases. That is the confession of[6] Rab Hamnuna Zuta on the Day of Atonement[7]. 

Mar b. Kabina used to add at the conclusion of his prayer : O my God ! (Guard my tongue from evil and my lips from speaking guile ; and to such as curse me let my soul be dumb, yea, let my soul be unto all as the dust. Open my heart to Thy Torah, and let my soul pursue Thy commandments. And do Thou deliver me from mishap, from the evil impulse, and from an evil woman and all evil which breaks forth to come upon the world[1]. If any design evil against me, speedily make their counsel of none effect, and frustrate their designs[2]. Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable before Thee, O Lord my Rock and Redeemer. 

Rab Sheshet, when observing a fast, used to add at the conclusion of his prayer : Lord of the universe ! It is revealed before Thee that when the Sanctuary was in existence, a man sinned and brought an offering, of which they sacrificed only the fat and the blood, and atonement was made for him. But now, I observe a fast, and my fat and blood are diminished. May it be Thy will, that my fat and blood which have been diminished may be accounted as though I had offered them before Thee upon the altar, and do Thou favour me[3]. 

R. Johanan said : R. Meir[4], on concluding the reading of the Book of Job, used to say: It is the fate of man to die and of cattle to be slaughtered, and all are destined to die. Happy is he who has grown in Torah and whose labour has been in Torah ; who has caused tranquillity of spirit to his Creator, advanced in good repute, and departed from the world with a good name. Of him said Solomon, "A good name is better than precious oil, and the day of death than the day of one's birth " (Eccles. vii. 1). It was a favourite saying of R. Meir : Learn with all thy heart and with all thy soul to know My ways and watch at the doors of My Torah. Guard My Torah in thy heart and let the fear of Me be before thine eyes. Keep thy mouth from all sin, and purify and sanctify thyself from all guilt and iniquity. Then shall I be with thee everywhere. 

It was a favourite saying of the Rabbis of Jabneh[1] : I am a creature [of God] and my neighbour is also His creature ; my work is in the city and his in the field ; I rise early to my work and he rises early to his. As he cannot excel in my work, so I cannot excel in his work. But perhaps thou sayest, "I do great things and he small things"! We have learnt that [it matters not whether] one does much or little, if only he direct his heart to Heaven. 

It was a favourite saying of Abbai: A man should always be cunning[2] in the fear [of God], giving the soft answer that turneth away wrath (cf. Prov. xv. 1), increasing peace with his brethren and relatives and with all men[3], even the heathen in the street ; so that he may be beloved above and popular on earth, and acceptable to his fellow-creatures. They say of Rabban Johanan b. Zakkai that nobody ever greeted him first, not even the heathen in the street. 

It was a favourite saying of Raba : The goal of wisdom is repentance and good works; so that a man shall not read [Torah] and study [Mishnah] and then contradict his father or mother or teacher or anybody greater than he in knowledge and number [of years]; as it is said, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, a good understanding have all that do thereafter" (Ps. cxi. 10). "All that learn[4]" is not said here, but "all that do thereafter," i.e. they that practise Torah for its own sake, but not they that practise Torah not for its own sake[5]. As for him who does not fulfil the Torah for its own sake, it were better had he never been created[1]. 

It was a favourite saying of Rab : Not like this world is the world to come. In the world to come there is neither eating nor drinking; no procreation of children[2] or business transactions; no envy or hatred or rivalry ; but the righteous sit enthroned, their crowns on their heads, and enjoy the lustre of the Shekinah; as it is said, "And they beheld God, and did eat and drink" (Exod. xxiv. ll)[3]. 

Our Rabbis have taught[4] : Greater is the promise given by the Holy One, blessed be He, to women than to men ; as it is said, "Rise up, ye women that, are at ease, and hear My voice ; ye confident daughters, give ear unto My speech" (Is. xxxii. 9)[5]. Rab asked R. Hiyya : Wherewith do women acquire merit[6]? By sending their children to learn [Torah] in the Synagogue and their husbands to study in the schools of the Rabbis, and waiting for their husbands until they return from the schools of the Rabbis[7]. 

As the Rabbis departed[8] from the school of R. Ammi[9] (another version: R. Hannina's school), they said to him: Mayest thou see thy world in thy life-time[10], and may thine end be in the life of the world to come and thy hope throughout the generations. May thy heart meditate in understanding, thy mouth speak wisdom, thy tongue abound in joyful songs, thine eyelids set thy glance straight before thee[11], thine eyes be illumined with the light of the Torah, thy countenance shine like the splendour of the firmament, thy lips utter knowledge, thy reins exult with up-rightness, and thy feet run to hear the words of the Ancient of days. 

As the Rabbis departed from the school of Rab Hisda (another version : the school of R. Samuel b. Nahmani) they said to him : "Our leaders[1] are well laden ; with no breach, and no going forth, and no outcry in our broad places" (Ps. cxliv. 14). "Our leaders are well laden" — Rab and Samuel (another version : R. Johanan and R. Eleazar) [differ in interpretation] ; one says, "Our leaders" in Torah "are well laden" with religious duties ; the other says, "Our leaders" in Torah and religious duties "are well laden" with sufferings. "With no breach" — may not our company [[fol. 17 b.]] be like the company of David from which issued Ahitophel ; "and no going forth" — may not our company be like the company of Saul from which issued Doeg the Edomite; "and no outcry" — may not our company be like the company of Elisha from which issued Gehazi ; "in our broad places" — that we may not have a son or disciple who spoiled his food in public, like the Nazarene[2]. 

"Hearken unto Me, ye stout-hearted, that are far from righteousness" (Is. xlvi. 12). Rab and Samuel (another version : R. Johanan and R. Eleazar) [differ in interpretation]. One says : The whole world is nourished through righteousness, but the "stout-hearted" are nourished by the arm[3]. The other says : The whole world is nourished through their merit, but they are not nourished even by their own merit. This is like the statement of Rab Judah who says in the name of Rab : Every day a Bat Kol issues from Mount Horeb[4] and proclaims : "All the world is nourished for the sake of My son, Hannina[5], but My son, Hannina, is satisfied with a Kab of locusts[6] from the Sabbath-eve to the next Sabbath-eve." This contradicts the statement of Rab Judah who says : Who are the "stout-hearted"? They are the foolish Gobeans[1]. Rab Joseph[2] said : Thou canst know [that the "stout-hearted" are the Gobeans] because not one of them has ever been made a proselyte. Rab Ashe said : [The "stout-hearted" are] the inhabitants of Mata Mehasya[3], for they beheld the glory of the Torah twice yearly, but not one of them has ever been made a proselyte. 

If a bridegroom wishes to read the Shema', etc. 

It is to be inferred that Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel is concerned lest a charge of presumption [be brought against a bridegroom who reads the Shema' on the first night of his marriage and therefore forbids it], whereas the Rabbis have no such concern [and permit it]. But we understood just the opposite of them ! For there is a Mishnaic teaching : In a place where they are accustomed to work on the ninth of Ab[4], we may work ; but in a place where they are not accustomed to work, we may not. Disciples of the wise must cease work in every place. Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel says : Everyone should regard himself as a disciple of the wise[5]. Here is an inconsistency of the Rabbis and an inconsistency of Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel ! R. Johanan said : The statement must be reversed[6]; but Rab Shesha b. Rab Iddi said : Thou hast surely no need to reverse the statement, because the Rabbis do not here contradict themselves. In the case of the reading of the Shema' which everybody reads, if [the bridegroom] also reads it, it would not seem presumptuous ; but in the latter instance, since everybody works [on the ninth of Ab] and he does not, it would appear presumptuous. Likewise, Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel does not contradict himself. In the case of the reading of the Shema', its validity depends on Kawwanah, and we testify that [the bridegroom] would not be able to concentrate his mind ; but here, if one saw [a man not working on the ninth of Ab] he would merely say "He has no work to do." Go out and see how many idle men there are in the street[1]. 

May we return to thee : Who reads.
