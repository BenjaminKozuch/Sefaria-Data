1 I.e. intended that his reading of the passage should be the fulfilment of his duty to recite the Shema'. But see the explanation in the Gemara. 

2 The reference is to somebody in authority who might resent the omission to salute him. 

3 At the end of "Creator of the luminaries," Singer, p. 39. 

4 The second section of the Shema' deals with the duty of studying Torah which continues throughout the day and night ; cf. Josh. i. 8. But the third paragraph contains the law of "Fringes" which does not apply at night. 

====================================================

1 That would seem to be implied in the statement "if he directed his heart"; but elsewhere in the Talmud it is stated that Kawwanah is not required. See Rosh Hash. 28 a. 

2 How can it be maintained that "if he directed his heart" means to study and not to prayer, since the Mishnah opens with the statement that he was studying? 

3 The man who was reading the Torah may have been a corrector of manuscripts and examining a paragraph of the Shema'. Of him it is required that his reading shall hare been with the intention of fulfilling his duty to recite it. 

4 In Hebrew only. 

5 See p. 9 n. 2. 

6 The Shema' was read in Greek in Caesarea; Schurer, II. ii. p. 284. 

7 How does he interpret the word "Hear"? 

8 I.e. the Shema' must be read audibly. 

9 He cannot derive it from "and these words shall be," since he has already used that to prove that only Hebrew may be employed. 

====================================================
Page 84
--------
1 If Rabbi were of opinion that the Torah can only be read in Hebrew, it would necessarily apply to the Shema'. Why, then, should he draw a conclusion from "And these words shall be"? His opinion must therefore be that the Torah can be read in any language ; and he draws the conclusion from "And these words shall be" that the Shema' must be read in Hebrew to oppose the inference which the Sages drew from "Hear, O Israel." 

2 M. : Ahai. We must read in the text B. Aha, not Rab Aha. 

3 M.: Eliezer. 

4 The first paragraph of the Shema'. 

5 M.: Joshua. 

====================================================

--------

1 Deut. xi. 19, in the second paragraph of the Shema'. 

2 The reference to "heart" in the second paragraph does not indicate Kawwanah, but teaches that the arm-Tefillin must be placed over against the heart. It is worn upon the muscle of the left arm, at a point nearest the heart. 

3 The first paragraph contains "and thou shalt talk of them," i.e. the command to recite; but the second contains "Ye shall teach them your children to talk of them" (so literally ; i.e. so that your children may talk of them by studying Torah). 

4 So M. ; edd. Kawwanah of the heart. 

====================================================
Page 86
--------

1 M. adds : b. Joseph. 

2 Thereby emphasising the doctrine of the Unity of God. 

3 M. : R. Zera. 

4 I.e. dwell on the word while reflecting that God is One everywhere. 

5 See above, at the beginning of the folio. That view is, the whole of the first paragraph requires Kawwanah. R. Johanan, in consistency with that opinion, maintains that if one has to stand for the recital of any part of the first paragraph, he should remain standing for the whole of it. 

6 Instead of "Our Rabbis have taught," M. reads : Rab Judah said in the name of Samuel. 

7 When in the course of teaching the time of the Shema' arrived, Rabbi did not stop to recite it. 

8 A form of address used by R. Hiyya to Rab, his nephew. See below, fol. 43a. By "princes" must be understood "ancestors great in Torah." It has been ingeniously conjectured that for *** (an uncertain word) we should read *** "son of my sister," that being the relationship in which Rab stood to him ; but it is inexplicable how so common a word as *** could have been corrupted. The 'Aruk reads ***, which may be connected with *** or *** "a relative by marriage"; see Krauss, p. 420. 

====================================================
Page 87
--------
1 An act which the pious Jew performs when reciting the first sentence of the Shema', based on Moses' action of hiding his face at the theophany (Exod. iii. 6). This was an indication that Rabbi recited the opening verse. 

2 And he intended this as a substitute for the remainder of the Shema'. 

3 Rabbi dealt with the theme of the Exodus when the time of the Shema' arrived, but afterwards recited what he had omitted. 

4 M. : Isaac. 

5 M. incorrectly adds : b. Isaac. 

6 Not Rabbah as in some edd. 

7 The word *** is derived from *** by Perles, J. Q. R. xvi. p. 355. The objection to this position is it tends to nocturnal pollution. 

====================================================
Page 88
--------

1 But R. Meir's view which has been under consideration so far cannot agree with R. Judah's, since the latter expounds a different opinion in the Mishnah. 

2 "Or the Megillah" is added by M. 

3 The Hallel proclaims the miracle of the Red Sea, and the Megillah the miracle of the frustration of Haman's plan to destroy the Jews. 

====================================================
Page 89
--------

1 M. : Raba. 

2 In Tosafot it is pointed out that there is no cause to stress the "individual," the rule holding good also of a Congregation. 

3 On the New Moon and the last six days of Passover; see Singer, p. 220. 

4 So M. correctly. Edd : Rab b. Shaba. 

5 M. : the School (or house) of Rabina. 

6 M. omits "not"; but its inclusion emphasises the objection. 

7 M. : R. Isaac b. Ashyan. 

8 A voluntary fast is here meant. On a statutory fast there is no question that tasting (e.g. food that is being cooked) is forbidden. 

9 According to one interpretation, the Tefillah is here intended; otherwise it is contradicted by the passage quoted by Rab Sheshet from the Mishnah, which permits one to offer greeting between the sections of the Shema' — which is recited before the Tefillah. But R. Abba interprets the phrase "before he prays" quite generally. 

10 On the Bamah was offered what should have been brought to the Temple. Similarly to greet a man before praying is to give him what is due to God. 

11 To pay him honour instead of God. 

====================================================
Page 90
--------

1 I.e. translate "for as an idolatrous altar is he to be accounted" if honour is paid to him first. 

2 Interpreting the latter part of the verse as it is written, without reading Bamah for bammeh. 

3 M.: Rab Nahmnn b. Isaac. 

4 See p. 82. 

5 To greet him, intentionally paying him the first honour. Should he meet him casually, he may salute him prior to praying. 

6 Exception was taken to the exaggeration in applying the word Bamah to such a case. The reply is that to attend to one's personal affairs before offering prayer in the morning is as prohibited as the erection of a Bamah. 

7 The verse is made to refer to man, not God. "Righteousness" is understood as the morning devotions. 

8 To be vouchsafed a dream was considered evidence of spiritual grace (cf. Joel iii. 1), and to be without a dream was accordingly deemed to be the consequence of gross, materialistic living. 

9 Translating thus : He who abides seven [nights] without being visited [by a dream] is evil. 

10 So M. correctly. Edd.: Aha. 

11 M: Hiyya b. Abba. 

12 Retaining the reading sabea' in Prov. xix. 23. 

====================================================
Page 91
--------

1 Between the end of the third paragraph of the Shema' and the beginning of the benediction which follows; Singer, p. 42. 

2 It is customary to conclude the Shema', not with the word "God," but with "true" borrowed from the next paragraph. Has the word "true" to be repeated when continuing the prayer ? 

3 M.: "Raba," and so to the end of the paragraph. 

4 "To descend" (or "to pass" so. before the Ark) means to act as Precentor. On "descending," see p. 65 n. 5. 

5 I.e. they say the opening and closing words of the third paragraph of the Shema', leaving out all in between, because it refers to the law of "Fringes" which does not apply at night. 

6 Since nothing has been mentioned about the "Fringes" — the theme of the paragraph — one cannot be regarded as having commenced it. 

7 M. : Behold Rab Samuel b. Rab Isaac has declared. 

====================================================

1 In Babylon. 

2 I.e. the benediction commencing "True and trustworthy"; Singer, p. 93. This benediction contains a reference to the Exodus. 

3 Even in his night-prayers; see above fol. 12b, p. 80. 

4 Continuing "Who is like unto Thee, O Lord?" Singer, p. 99. 

5 Some edd. read "learning" in error. 

6 Why is all this argument necessary, since R. Joshua b. Karhah gives a reason in the Mishnah ? 

====================================================
Page 93
--------
1 To read the Shema' before patting on the Tefillin. From the following discussion it will be seen that this was not Rab's regular practice, but he did so on one occasion. 

2 Edd. add *** "in a grave," which is probably a gloss. M. reads *** "in a wall" i.e. of a cave or vault, where graves were often excavated. See J.E. III. p. 437, T.A. II. pp. 72 ff. 

3 On the principle "One who is occupied with a religions duty is exempt from a religious duty." Cf. the discussion on fol. 11a, p. 68. 

4 Engaged in digging; in which case one continues the work, while the other offers his prayers. 

5 This Rabbi's statement in the Mishnah is interpreted to mean that first the Shema' must be read and then the Tefillin laid. 

6 M. adds : "to study the Chapters of the Sifra debe Rab" as on fol. 11b, p. 71. 

7 Prior to studying Torah. 

====================================================
Page 94
--------
1 Rab Hiyya b. Ashe's statement has no bearing on the question under discussion. It was quoted to prove that Rab uttered a benediction before lecturing on Mishnah. In fact, this Rabbi's statement quoted in fol. 11 b, does not mention "laid Tefillin and after that read the Shema'." 

2 He delayed in bringing the Tefillin for which he had been sent. Rab, fearing that the correct time for reading the Shema' would pass before he arrived, on that occasion read it and afterwards laid the Tefillin. 

3 An euphemism for "against God." He declares the Unity of God (by reading the Shema') without adducing the evidence as proclaimed by the Tefillin. Rev. A. Newman writes : "Against himself" may be taken literally. The Shema' which he is reading enjoins the wearing of Tefillin ; therefore the recital without the phylacteries involves an inconsistency. His acts belie bis words. 

4 M. : Rabbah b. Bar Hannah said in the name of R. Johanan. 

5 "The cleansing here has nothing to do with priestly ablution; it means simply to prepare oneself in such a way as to be able to concentrate all one's mind during the prayer without any disturbance"; Schechter, Aspect of Rabbinic Theology, p. 66 n. 1. On the practice of the Essenes, see Schurer, n. ii. p. 199. 

6 So M. correctly; edd. Raba. Cf. Hyman, II. p. 437 a. 

7 "His whole body" added by M. 

8 Implying that he is totally clean. 

====================================================
Page 95
--------

1 M.: Raba to Rafram b. Pappa. 

2 There is a similar law among the Muhammadans : "But if... ye find no water, take fine clean sand and rub your faces and your hands therewith"; Koran iv. 46, v. 9; Lane, p. 72. 

3 M.: "At the time of the reading of the Shema'." He feared that the right time would pass during the search for water. 

4 The time for Tefillah is not so strictly defined. 

5 Some authorities insert here : "These are the words of R. Judah." 

6 Who allows it to be read inaudibly, how does he explain "Hear"? See fol 13 a, p. 83. 

====================================================
Page 96
--------

1 Because the act was accompanied by the saying of a benediction which the deaf man would not be able to hear. 

2 In Rabbinic law a distinction is often drawn between the validity of an act which one contemplates doing and its validity after it has been performed; and it is sometimes decided that though the former (*** "as at the beginning," ab initio) is illegitimate, nevertheless the accomplished fact *** = *** "that which has been done," post factum) may be considered as complying with the requirements of the law. See Mielziner, p. 197 ; Bacher, Terminologie, ii. p. 232. 

3 Omitted by M. in conformity with the wording of the Mishnah. 

4 R. Jose's objection to inaudibility does not apply to the benediction of Terumah, because it is not so essential a feature of the act, that without it the whole would be illegitimate. 

5 This is the equivalent of "who has read"; therefore the first Tanna (i.e. R. Judah) agrees with the Mishnah about Terumah, not R. Jose. 

====================================================
Page 97
--------
1 Because the Grace after meals is a Pentateuchal ordinance (see fol. 21a, p. 135), and therefore parallel to the case of the Shema' where R. Jose does not admit as valid even the post factum reading, if inaudible. 

2 No contradiction in R. Judah agreeing with R. Judah the son of R. Simeon b. Pazzi, although in the matter of the inaudible Grace after meals it was concluded that he allows it only post factum. 

3 That even ab initio it is permissible for a deaf man to separate Terumah. 

4 That only post factum is the inaudible Grace after meals valid. 

5 So M.; not "there is a Mishnaic teaching" as in edd. 

6 Not on their audibility. 

7 As to introduce R. Meir's teaching into the discussion. 

8 The teaching of R. Judah the son of R. Simeon b. Pazzi, viz. the deaf person may separate the Terumah ab initio, is in agreement with R. Meir's view that the Shema' may be read inaudibly ab initio. 

9 R. Judah's view that the act of the deaf person is only allowed post factum agrees with the statement of his teacher, R. Eleazar b. 'Azariah, that post factum only is the inaudible reading of the Shema' permissible. 

====================================================

--------
1 A boy under the age of 13 years. 

2 The point at issue is the fact that such a recital must be inaudible to the reader. 

3 Viz. the deaf person is in a different category from the mentally defective and minor. The text is literally: Perhaps this as it is and that as it is. 

4 The stage of mental development when he is introduced to the practice of the religious duties — about the age of nine or ten years.

5 M.: Mar 'Ukba. 

6 I.e. ab initio it should be audible; only post factum is it valid if inaudible. 

7 And post factum the inaudible reading is valid. 

====================================================

1 Which involve the utterance of a benediction. 

2 Therefore audibility should be required! 

3 The word hasket translated "attend" is rendered in R.V. "keep silence." For some Rabbinic interpretations of the word, see fol. 63 b. 

4 With R. Judah in permitting the inaudible reading to suffice post factum, and with R. Jose in allowing the letters to be indistinctly enunciated. 

5 Referring to the Sadducees ; cf . Schurer, II. ii. p. 38. 

6 So M. correctly ; not Osha'yah as in edd. Rab Josiah is not the same as R. Josiah mentioned in the preceding paragraph. 

7 E.g. "Thou shalt write them... thou shalt bind them." 

====================================================

1 On this argument, see p. 18 n. 5. 

2 welimmadtem "and ye shall teach" is pointed welimmud tam "and the teaching [shall be] perfect." 

3 By reason of a word ending with the same letter as the initial of the next word. 

4 J.T. adds the interesting example, nishba' 'adonai "The Lord hath sworn," emphasizing the difference in the two guttural letters. It indeed mentions that one who is unable to make a clear pronunciation of the gutturals may not conduct a Service. 

====================================================

1 With these alterations the verse reads, "When one utters the name of the Almighty distinctly in the prayer where the King [majestic plural] is [i.e. which contains a reference to the Kingdom of Heaven, viz. the Shema'], it snoweth in the shadow of death." The words melakim bah "kings therein" have been connected, with more ingenuity than probability, by Schorr (quoted in Goldschmidt) with *** and ***, making the first clause mean: When one utters the name of the Almighty distinctly, reading the words of similar sound plainly. 

2 The word *** may be pointed to mean "aloes" (so R.V. here) or "tents." In the preceding verse, "thy tents" has the same letters ; they are consequently given the same meaning here. By "tents" the Rabbis frequently understand "houses of study"; e.g. "And Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents" (Gen. xxv. 27) is explained (cf. the Targum): attending schools of learning. 

3 "For it is written" etc. is a later addition to the text; cf. A.P.A.i.p.451 n. 4. 

4 Occurring in the first and second paragraphs respectively. 

5 And there is no need to repeat from the beginning.

1 M. : Hast thou not taught us... the Shema' on the first night? 

2 Because these have numerous branches, and the workmen have less fear of falling to disturb their mind ; so Rashi. The reason J. T. gives is because the fatigue of getting down from these trees is very great. 

3 Through fear of falling. The law is stricter with him, because his time is his own. 

4 Her name was Rachel. The son is not called by his father's name, which was Isur (Bab. Bat. 149 a), because his mother became pregnant while a prisoner of war; and although the father embraced Judaism before the child was born, his name is omitted. See Ketubot 23 a. 

5 M. adds : R. Simeon b. Johai says. 

6 With "Hear, O Israel," i.e. the Shema*, since the word "hear" is common to both.

2 To act as Precentor, because this would interfere with their duty to their employer. 

3 A Kohen (see Glossary, s.v.) has the privilege to "raise his hands" in the course of the Service to pronounce the priestly benediction (Num. vi. 24-26) ; but if a labourer, he must not do so. In Talmudical times, this was done daily ; but now it is usually reserved for Festivals only, the Precentor pronouncing the benediction in the daily Service (Singer, p. 53). Cf. J. E. III. p. 244. 

4 The prayer "Give us understanding"; Singer, p. 55. 

5 Cf. below fol. 28 b, p. 188 where Rabban Gamaliel requires the Eighteen Benedictions to be said daily, whereas R. Joshua declares an abstract sufficient. 

6 If he said it in its entirety, it might interfere unduly with his work. 

7 The Grace before meals is not a Pentateuchal ordinance, but the Grace after meals is. Cf. fol. 48 b. 

8 What are the two benedictions? 

9 Singer, p. 280, "Blessed art Thou. ..Who givest food unto all." 

10 Ibid. "We thank Thee" and p. 282 "And rebuild Jerusalem." These two benedictions are to be condensed into one. 

11 There would then be no opportunity for the labourers to waste time under the pretext of saying the entire Grace.

2 The laws of mourning (here abelut, the mourning before the burial, which is stricter than abelut, mourning after burial) are derived from Deut. xxvi. 14. Being a Pentateuchal ordinance, how could he set them aside for the personal reason he gives ? 

3 This verse relates to a time of mourning, and it mentions only "a bitter day" ; from this he deduced that the "bitterness" does not apply in the night. 

4 It is still customary for the friends who attend the funeral to form themselves into two rows through which the mourners pass, receiving words of condolence. 

5 Said after the meal on returning from the cemetery.

1 The "household above" is the angelic host whose dissensions lead to quarrels on earth. The "household below" is either mankind generally or the Sages of Israel. 

2 But for the prestige it brings them. Cf. Abot iv. 7: "Make not of the Torah a crown wherewith to aggrandise thyself, nor a spade wherewith to dig. So also used Hillel to say, He who makes a worldly use of the crown of the Torah shall waste away. Hence thou mayest infer that whosoever derives a profit for himself from the words of the Torah is helping on his own destruction." Singer, p. 196. See Schechter, Aspects, pp. 159 ff.

1 This sentence is omitted in M. as well as in the Prayer Book version ; see Singer, p. 54. 

2 M. inserts here : Return their recompense upon their head; destroy them and humble them before me. And do Thou deliver me from calamities and adverse times, and from all kinds of punishments which are hastening to break forth upon the world. 

3 M. inserts here : A certain disciple used to add at the conclusion of his prayer : Close mine eyes from looking on evil, mine ears from hearing idle words, my heart from reflecting on wickedness, and my reins from thinking of transgression. Make my feet to walk to Thy commandments and righteous ways ; and may Thy mercies be turned upon me so that I may be of those spared for life in Jerusalem. 

4 "Said: R. Meir" added by M., probably correctly. See D.S. ad loc., A.T. II. p. 13 n. 1. This reference to R. Meir connects the series of prayers with the series of aphorisms which follows.

1 Jabneh (in Greek, Jamnia) is identical with Jabneel (Josh. xv. 11), and is situated in S. Palestine, near the coast. After the destruction of the Second Temple, the town sprang into great prominence, inasmuch as the Great Sanhedrin transferred its sittings there from Jerusalem ; and Rabban Johanan b. Zakkai founded a School which became famous. See Neubauer, pp. 73ff., J. E. vn. p. 18.

3 I.e. their beholding God was the equivalent of eating and drinking. Thus it is said of Moses that, during his stay on Mt Sinai, he neither ate nor drank (Exod. xxxiv. 28) but was nourished from the lustre of the Shekinah. See Exod. Rab. III. 1. 

4 "Our Rabbis have taught" is wanting in edd., but added by M. 

5 The verse is given a complimentary sense which it does not possess in the context. 

6 Since they are exempted from many religions duties incumbent upon men. See fol. 20 b, p. 132.

1 Allufim means "oxen" (so R.V. here), but also "leaders." 

2 "Like the Nazarene" is omitted in the later editions through fear of the Censor. "Spoiled (or, cooked) food in public" means, laid himself open to suspicion of heresy by his public declarations. See Herford, Christianity in Talmud and Midrash, pp. 60 f.
