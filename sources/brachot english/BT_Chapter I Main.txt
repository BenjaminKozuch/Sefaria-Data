
CHAPTER I 

MISHNAH I 

From what time may the Shema'[1] be read in the evening? From [[fol. 2a.]] the time the priests[2] enter [the Temple] to partake of their Terumah, until the end of the first watch[3]. These are the words of R. Eliezer; but the Sages[4] say: Until midnight. Rabban Gamaliel says: Until the rise of dawn[5]. It once happened that his sons returned from a feast [after midnight] and said to him, "We have not read the Shema' !" He told them, "If the dawn has not yet risen, you are still under the obligation of reading it. And not only in this connection do they so decide; but wherever the Sages use the expression 'Until midnight,' the obligation continues until the rise of dawn." The duty of burning the fat and parts of the animal[6] continues until the rise of dawn. Likewise with all offerings which have to be eaten the same day [they are sacrificed][7], the duty continues until the rise of dawn. If so, why do the Sages say "Until midnight"? In order to keep a man far from transgression. 

GEMARA 

What authority has the Tanna [that the Shema' is to be read at all] that he raises the question: From what time?[8] Further, on what ground does he first deal with the evening ? Let him first deal with [the Shema'] of the morning ! 

The Tanna bases his authority on Scripture ; for it is written, "When thou liest down and when thou risest up" (Deut. vi. 7)[1]. His statement in the Mishnah is to be understood thus : When is the time for reading the Shema' which is to be recited when lying down? From the time the priests enter [the Temple] to partake of their Terumah. Or if thou wilt, I can say that he derives [his reason for commencing with the evening] from the account of the Creation ; for it is written : "It was evening and it was morning, one day" (Gen, i. 5)[2]. 

If this be so, in the sequel where he teaches : In the morning [the reading of the Shema'] is preceded by two benedictions and followed by one; in the evening it is preceded by two and followed by two[3], let him likewise treat of the evening first ! The Tanna commenced with the evening and then treats of the morning[4]; but while on the subject of the morning, he explains matters connected with the morning, and afterwards explains matters connected with the evening. 

The teacher stated : From the time the priests enter [the Temple] to partake of their Terumah. Yes, but when do the priests partake of their Terumah ? From the time the stars appear. Then let him explicitly teach : "From the time of the appearance of the stars" ! He wishes to tell us something incidentally : When do the priests partake of their Terumah ? From the time the stars appear[5]. He thereby informs us that [the omission of] the sin-offering does not prevent [the priest from partaking of the Terumah]. This is in agreement with the teaching : "When the sun is down and it is clean" (Lev. xxii. 7)[6] — i.e. the setting of the sun[7] prevents him from partaking of the Terumah, but not [his failure to bring] his sin-offering. 

How is it to be known, however, that the phrase "When the sun is down" means the [complete] setting of the sun[1], and the phrase "It is clean" means the day is clean? Perhaps the former signifies the setting of its light[2], and the latter the man shall be clean ! Rabbah b. Rab Shela answered : In that case the text [[fol. 2b.]] should have read weyithar[3] ; what means wetaher? The day is clean [of light]; as people commonly say, "When the sun has set, the day is cleansed." 

In the West[4], this explanation of Rabbah b. Rab Shela had not been heard by them, and they raised the question: The phrase "When the sun is down" means the [complete] setting of the sun, and the phrase "It is clean" means the day is clean ; but perhaps the former signifies the setting of its light, and the latter the man shall be clean ! They then solved it from a Baraita ; for it is taught in a Baraita : The sign for the matter[5] is the appearance of the stars. Conclude from this that the [complete] setting of the sun is intended ; and what means "It is clean" ? The day is clean. 

The teacher stated : From the time the priests enter [the Temple] to partake of their Terumah. Against this I quote: From what time may the Shema' be read in the evening ? From the time when the poor man[6] goes home to eat his bread with salt, until such time as he usually stands up to leave his meal ! The latter part of this passage is certainly at variance with our Mishnah[7] ; but is it to be said that the first part is also at variance with it ? No ; the poor man and the priest have the one standard of time. 

I quote the following against our Mishnah : From what time may we begin to read the Shema' in the evening? From the time that people go home to eat their bread on the Sabbath-eve[1]. These are the words of R. Meir ; but the Sages say : From the time the priests[2] are entitled to partake of their Terumah. A sign for the matter is the appearance of the stars, and although there is no proof of this[3], yet is there some indication ; as it is said, "So we wrought in the work : and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared" (Neh. iv. 15), and it continues "That in the night they may be a guard to us, and may labour in the day" (ibid. v. 16). What is the meaning of this latter verse? Shouldest thou say that immediately the sun set it was reckoned to be night, but they worked late and started early[4] — come and hear[5] : "That in the night they may be a guard to us, and may labour in the day." 

The thought has occurred to thee that the poor man and people generally have the same standard of time[6]. Shouldest thou, however, maintain that the poor man and the priest have the same standard of time, then the opinion of the Sages and R. Meir would be identical[7] ! Is it then to be concluded that the poor man and the priest have each a different standard of time ? No ; the poor man and the priest have the same standard of time, but the poor man and people generally have a different standard. 

The poor man and the priest have the same standard of time ! Against this I quote : From what time do we begin to read the Shema' in the evening ? From the time that the day becomes hallowed on the Sabbath-eve. These are the words of R. Eliezer. R. Joshua says : From the time the priests become ritually clean to partake of their Terumah. R. Meir says: From the time the priests bathe so as to be able to partake of their Terumah. (R. Judah asked him, "But do not the priests bathe while it is yet day[1] ?") R. Hannina says : From the time the poor man goes home to eat his bread with salt. R. Ahai (another version : R. Aha) says : From the time when the majority of people go home to have their evening repast. Shouldest thou maintain that the poor man and the priest have the same standard of time, then R. Hannina and R. Joshua hold the same opinion[2] ! Must it not therefore be concluded that each of them has a different standard ? Yes, draw that conclusion. 

Which of the two[3] is later[4]? It is more probable that the poor man is later ; for shouldest thou maintain that he is earlier, then R. Hannina and R. Eliezer would hold the same opinion[5] ! Must it not therefore be concluded that the poor man is later? Yes, draw that conclusion. 

The teacher stated above : "R. Judah asked him, 'But do not the priests bathe while it is yet day?'" R. Judah's question to R. Meir is a forcible one ! But R. Meir answered him thus : Dost thou think that I agree with thy opinion of "twilight[6]" ? I agree with R, Jose's opinion. For R. Jose said : The twilight is like a flicker of the eye ; the night comes on and the day passes without anyone being able to perceive it[7]. 

[[fol. 3a.]] R. Meir has contradicted himself[1]! There are two Tannaim in the sense of R. Meir[2]. R. Eliezer has contradicted himself[3] ! There are two Tannaim in the sense of R. Eliezer. Or if thou wilt, I can say that the first part of the Mishnaic statement is not R. Eliezer's[4]. 

Until the end of the first watch. 

What is R. Eliezer's view ? If he holds that the night is divided into three watches, let him say explicitly [in the Mishnah] "until the end of the fourth hour[5]." If, on the other hand, he holds that the night is divided into four watches[6], let him say explicitly "until the end of the third hour." His opinion is certainly that there are three watches in the night ; but his intention is to inform us that there are watches in heaven as on earth[7]. For there is a teaching[8] : R. Eliezer says : There are three watches in the night, and at each watch, the Holy One, blessed be He, sits enthroned and roars like a lion ; as it is said, "The Lord doth roar from on high, and utter His voice from His holy habitation ; He doth mightily roar[9] because of His fold " (Jer. xxv. 30). A sign for the matter [of the three earthly night-watches] is : at the first watch, the ass brays ; at the second, dogs bark ; and at the third, the babe sucks at the breast of its mother and a woman converses with her husband. 

Of what is R. Eliezer thinking ? If he is thinking of the commencement of the watches, what need is there for a sign of the beginning of the first watch, since it is dusk ? Should he be thinking of the end of the watches, what need is there for a sign of the end of the last watch, since it is day ? Nay, he must be thinking of the end of the first watch, the beginning of the last watch, and the middle of the central watch. Or if thou wilt, I can say that in every case he is thinking of the end of the watches ; and shouldest thou urge that a sign of the end of the last watch is unnecessary, and ask what is its purpose ? It is for the reading of the Shema' on the part of one who sleeps in a dark room[1] and does not know when is the time for reading the Shema'. Therefore, when the woman converses with her husband and the child sucks at the breast of its mother, let him get up and read it. 

R. Isaac b. Samuel[2] said in the name of Rab[3]: The night is divided into three watches[4], and at each watch the Holy One, blessed be He, sits enthroned, roars like a lion and exclaims, "Alas for My children, for whose iniquities I destroyed My house, burnt My Temple, and exiled them among the nations of the world ! " 

There is a teaching : R. Jose said : Once I was journeying by the way, and I entered one of the ruins of Jerusalem to pray. Elijah[5] — may he be remembered for good ! — came, waited at the entrance for me, and stayed until I had concluded my prayer[6]. After I had finished my prayer he said to me, " Peace be to thee, my master." I responded, "Peace be to thee, my master and teacher." Then he said to me, "My son, why didst thou enter this ruin ?" I answered, "To pray." He said to me, "Thou shouldest have prayed by the roadside." I said, "I feared lest passers-by interrupt me." Then said he to me, " Thou shouldest have offered an abbreviated prayer[1]." On that occasion I learnt three things from him : first, one should not enter ruins ; second, it is permissible to pray by the roadside ; third, one who prays by the roadside should offer an abbreviated prayer. 

Then he said to me, "My son, what sound didst thou hear in that ruin ?" I answered, "I heard a Bat Kol moaning like a dove[2], crying, 'Alas for My children for whose iniquities I destroyed My house[3], burnt My Temple, and exiled them among the nations ! '" He said to me, "By thy life and the life of thy head, not only at this hour does it so cry, but thrice daily it exclaims thus. Moreover, whenever the Children of Israel enter their Synagogues and Houses of Study and respond 'Let His great Name be blessed[4],' the Holy One, blessed be He, shakes His head[5] and exclaims, 'Happy the King Who is so praised in His house ! Alas[6] for the Father Who has banished His children ! And alas for the children who have been banished from their Father's table ! '" 

Our Rabbis have taught : For three reasons one should not enter ruins : on account of suspicion[7], of falling fabric and evil spirits[8]. [Why mention] on account of suspicion, since thou canst [[fol. 3 b.]] derive [a sufficient reason] from the danger of falling fabric ? They might be new ruins[9]. Then derive it from the danger of evil spirits ! This would not apply when two men entered a ruin. But should there be two men, there would likewise be no ground for suspicion[10] ! There would be in the case of two men of ill-repute. [Why mention] on account of falling fabric, since thou canst derive [a sufficient reason] from the grounds of suspicion and evil spirits ? No, not in the case of two men of good repute. [Why mention] on account of evil spirits, since thou canst derive [a sufficient reason] from the grounds of suspicion and falling fabric ? No, not in the case of new ruins and two men of good repute. Is there no fear of evil spirits also when there are two men ? In such places where evil spirits resort there is occasion for fear. Or if thou wilt, I can say that even in the case of a person alone and new ruins situated in a wild place[1] there is no ground for suspicion, because a woman does not frequent such a spot ; but the fear of evil spirits remains. 

Our Rabbis have taught : The night is divided into four watches. These are the words of Rabbi[2]. R. Nathan says : Three. What is R. Nathan's reason ? Because it is written, "So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the outermost part of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch " (Judges vii 19). Hence he teaches that there cannot be a "middle watch" unless one precedes and follows. How does Rabbi explain the phrase "middle watch" ? He takes it to mean one of the middle watches. What reply does R. Nathan make to this? He asks, Does Scripture state "one of the two middle watches"? No; the "middle watch" is explicitly mentioned[3]. 

What is Rabbi's reason [for declaring there are four watches] ? R. Zerika stated that R. Ammi said in the name of[4] R. Joshua b. Levi : One verse states, "At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto Thee because of Thy righteous ordinances" (Ps. cxix. 62) and another verse states, "Mine eyes forestalled the night-watches" (ibid. V. 148). How is this? There must be four watches in the night[5]. How does R. Nathan answer this argument? He agrees with the opinion of R. Joshua ; for there is a Mishnaic teaching[6] : R. Joshua says : Until the third hour [in the day may the morning Shema' be read], for so is the custom of kings to rise at the third hour. Six hours of the night and two of the day make two watches[1]. Rab Ashe said: A watch and a half are also referred to as "watches[2]." 

R. Zerika also stated that R. Ammi said in the name of[3] R. Joshua b. Levi : In the presence of the dead, we should only speak of matters relating to the dead. R. Abba b. Kahana said : This applies only to words of Torah ; but as for worldly matters we can have no objection[4]. Another version is : R. Abba b. Kahana said : This applies even to words of Torah ; how much more so to worldly matters ! 

How David rose at midnight ! He rose at eventide ; as it is written, "I arose early beneshef[5] and cried" (Ps. cxix. 147). Whence is it learnt that neshef means evening ? Because it is written, "In the twilight [beneshef], in the evening of the day, in the blackness of night and the darkness" (Prov. vii. 9). R. Osha'ya said in the name of R. Aha[6] : Thus declared David, "Midnight never passed me by in my sleep[7]." R. Zera said : Until midnight David used to slumber like a horse[8], but from thence he grew strong like a lion[9]. Rab Ashe said : Until midnight he was occupied with words of Torah, but from thence with psalms and praises. 

Neshef means evening ! Lo, it means the morning ; for it is written, "And David smote them from the neshef even unto the evening ['ereb] of the next day" (I Sam. xxx. 17). Is this not to be understood to mean from the morning unto the evening? No, from evening unto evening. If so, the text should have read "from the neshef unto the neshef" or "from the 'ereb unto the 'ereb" ! But, says Raba[1], there are two occasions in the day called neshef; there is the neshef of the night followed by day, and the neshef of the day followed by night. 

Did David know when it was [exactly] midnight, since even Moses our teacher was not certain ; as it is written, "About mid-night will I go out into the midst of Egypt" (Exod. xi. 4) ? What means "about midnight" ? Are we to suppose that the Holy One, blessed be He, used the phrase "about midnight" to Moses ? Can there be any doubt in the mind of God ? Nay ; God told him "At midnight[2]"; but Moses came and said "about midnight." Hence it is to be understood that Moses was in doubt, but David did know it ! He had a sign. For R. Hannah b. Bizna[3] said in the name of R. Simeon Hasida : There was a harp hanging above David's bed, and when the time of midnight arrived a North wind came and blew upon it, so that it produced melody[4]. He used immediately to rise and occupy himself with Torah until the break of dawn. 

At the rise of dawn, the wise men of Israel entered his presence and said to him, "Our lord, the king, thy people Israel are in need of sustenance." He answered them, "Go, let each sustain himself from the other[5]." They said to him, "A handful cannot satisfy a lion, nor can a pit be filled with its own clods[6]." He said to them, "Go, stretch forth your hands with the army[7]." At once they took counsel with Ahitophel, consulted the Sanhedrin[8], and inquired of the Urim and Tummim[1]. Rab Joseph asked : What is the Scriptural authority for this? "And after Ahitophel was Benaiah the son of Jehoiada[2], and Abiathar ; and the captain of the king's host was Joab" (I Chron. xxvii. 34) — "Ahitophel " was the counsellor, for thus it is stated, "Now the counsel of Ahitophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man inquired of [[fol. 4a.]] the word of God" (2 Sam. xvi. 23). "Benaiah the son of Jehoiada" refers to the Sanhedrin ; for so the Scriptures declare, "And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites" (2 Sam. xx. 23). "Abiathar[3]" denotes the Urim and Tummim[4]. Why were the members of the Sanhedrin called Kereti and Peleti ? They were called Kereti because they were concise [koretim] with their words, and Peleti because they were "distinguished" [muflaim] with their words[5]. After them came "the captain of the king's host, Joab[6]."
 
Rab Isaac b. Adda[7] (another version : Rab Isaac b. Rab Iddi) said : What Scriptural authority is there for the story of David's harp? "Awake, my glory ; awake, psaltery and harp; I will awake the dawn" (Ps. lvii. 9). 

R. Zera said : Moses certainly knew [the exact time of midnight], and David also knew it. Since David knew it, why did he require a harp ? In order that he may be aroused from his sleep. And since Moses knew it, what object had he in saying "About mid-night" ? Moses thought that perhaps Pharaoh's astrologers would err[8] and say, "Moses is a liar." For a teacher has said : Teach thy tongue to say, "I do not know," lest thou be led to falsehoods and be apprehended. Rab Ashe said : It[1] happened in the middle of the night of the thirteenth [of the first month] which is the beginning of the fourteenth ; and thus spake Moses to Israel, "The Holy One, blessed be He, said, 'To-morrow, like the time of midnight, as it is now, I will go forth in the midst of Egypt.'" 

David prayed, "Keep my soul, for I am godly" (Ps. Ixxxvi. 2). [R.] Levi[2] and R. Isaac differ in their interpretation. One explains : Thus spake David before the Holy One, blessed be He, "Lord of the Universe, am I not godly, seeing that all the kings of the East and West sleep unto the third hour of the day, but as for me, 'At midnight I rise to give thanks unto Thee' (Ps. cxix. 62)?" The other explains : Thus spake David before the Holy One, blessed be He, "Lord of the Universe, am I not godly, seeing that all the kings of the East and West sit in companies[3] in all their pomp, whereas my hands are stained with the blood of a foetus or with the placenta[4] in order to pronounce a woman clean to her husband ? Moreover, whatever I do I discuss with my teacher Mephibosheth[5], saying to him, 'Mephibosheth, my teacher, have I decided well ? Have I convicted correctly or acquitted correctly ? Did I rightly pronounce unclean or rightly pronounce clean?' And I was not ashamed [so to do]." R. Joshua b. Rab Iddi[6] asked : What is the Scriptural authority for this ? "I will also speak of Thy testimonies before kings, and will not be ashamed" (Ps. cxix. 46). 

It has been taught: His name was not Mephibosheth but Ishbosheth. Why, then, was he called Mephibosheth? Because he used to put David to shame[7] on questions of Halakah. On that account David merited that Chileab[8] should issue from him; and R. Johanan said: His pame was not Chileab but Daniel[1]. Why, then, was he called Chileab? Because he put Mephibosheth to shame[2] on questions of Halakah; and concerning him Solomon said in his wisdom, "My son, if thy heart be wise, my heart will be glad, even mine" (Prov. xxiii. 15), and "My son, be wise, and make mine heart glad, that I may answer him that taunteth me" (ibid, xxvii. 11). 

But how could David describe himself as "godly[3]"? For behold it is written, "If I had not [lule'] believed to look upon the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living" (Ps. xxvii. 13); and it has been taught in the name of R. Jose : Why are there dots over the word lule'[4]? David spake before the Holy One, blessed be He, "Lord of the Universe, I am confident that Thou repayest a good reward to the righteous in the hereafter, but I know not whether I have a portion among them or not[5]. Perhaps my sin will cause [me not to[6]]." This is like the teaching of R. Jacob b. Iddi who asked: It is written, "Behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee whithersoever thou goest" (Gen. xxviii. 15), and then it is written, "Jacob was greatly afraid" (ibid, xxxii. 8)! But Jacob said, "Perhaps sin will cause [His protection to be withheld]." This is like the teaching: "Till Thy people pass over, O Lord, till the people pass over that Thou hast gotten" (Exod. xv. 16). — "Till Thy people pass over, O Lord" refers to the first entry [into Canaan]; "till the people pass over that Thou hast gotten" refers to the second entry[7]. Hence the Sages said : The Israelites were worthy that a miracle should be performed for them in the days of Ezra in the same way that it was performed for them in the days of Joshua, the son of Nun; but sin caused [the miracle to be withheld][1]. 

But the Sages say: Until midnight. 

With whose opinion do the Sages agree? If with R. Eliezer's, let them express themselves like R. Eliezer; if with Rabban Gamaliel's, [[fol. 4b.]] let them express themselves like Rabban Gamaliel[2]! They certainly agree with Rabban Gamaliel, and the reason they say Until midnight is to keep a man far from transgression. 

This is like the teaching: The Sages made a "fence[3]" to their words, so that a man shall not come from the field[4] in the evening and say, "I will go home, eat a little, drink a little, sleep a little, and after that I will read the Shema' and say the Tefillah"; for slumber may overcome him and as a result he may sleep through all the night[5]. Rather should a man come from the field in the evening and enter a Synagogue ; if he is accustomed to read [the Scriptures], let him read; if he is accustomed to study[6], let him study. Then let him read the Shema' and say the Tefillah; after that he should eat his meal and say Grace. Whosoever transgresses the words of the Sages [in this matter] is worthy of death. 

Why is it not stated in any other place that whosoever transgresses the words of the Sages is worthy of death, but here a distinction is made and it is so stated? If thou wilt, I can say that here there is the danger of the overpowering force of sleep[1]; or if thou wilt, I can say that it is intended to exclude the opinion of those who maintain that the evening prayer is voluntary[2]; and hence we are informed that it is an obligation. 

The teacher stated above : "Then let him read the Shema' and say the Tefilldh." This supports the view of R. Johanan who declared : Who will inherit the world to come? He who joins the Ge'ullah to the evening Tefillah[3]. R. Joshua b. Levi said : The Tefillot were arranged in the middle[4]. 

What is the point on which they differ? If thou wilt, I can say [they differ in the interpretation of] a Scriptural passage; or if thou wilt, I can say [they differ] in their reasoning. If thou wilt, I can say [they differ] in their reasoning : for R. Johanan holds that the deliverance [from Egypt] began also at night[5], but the complete deliverance did not take place until the morning. R. Joshua b. Levi holds that since the deliverance did not take place until the morning, [what happened in the night] is not to be considered a proper deliverance. Or if thou wilt, I can say [they differ in the interpretation of] a Scriptural passage; and they both expound the same verse, viz. "When thou liest down and when thou risest up" (Deut. vi. 7). R. Johanan holds that an analogy is here to be drawn between "lying down" and "rising up" in this sense: as with "rising up" the order is the reading of the Shema' and then the Tefillah, so also with "lying down" the order is the reading of the Shema' and then the Tefillah. R. Joshua b. Levi, however, thinks that the analogy is to be drawn between "lying down" and "rising up" in this sense : as with "rising up" the reading of the Shema' is nearer to his contact with the bed[1], so with "lying down" the reading of the Shema' must be nearer to his contact with the bed. 

Mar b. Rabina quoted in objection : In the evening [the reading qf the Shema'] is both preceded and followed by two benedictions[2]. If, then, thou sayest that the Ge'ullah must be joined to the Tefillah, behold that condition is not fulfilled because one is required to say the prayer "Cause us, O Lord our God, to lie down[3]!" They answer: Since the Rabbis instituted the prayer "Cause us, etc.," it is to be considered part of the Ge'ullah[4]. If thou dost not admit this, how is it possible to affect the same union in the morning service ; for lo, R. Johanan has said : Before the Tefillah one says, "O Lord, open Thou my lips" (Ps. li. 17)[5], and at its conclusion, "Let the words of my mouth... be acceptable" (ibid. xix. 15) ! In this case, since the Rabbis instituted the saying of "O Lord, open Thou my lips," it is considered part of the Tefillah ; so likewise in the evening prayer, the Rabbis having instituted the saying of "Cause us, etc.," it is considered part of the Ge'ullah. 

R. Eleazar b. R. Abina[6] said: Whoever recites Psalm cxlv. thrice[7] daily may be assured that he is a son of the world to come. What is the reason? Is it to be supposed because the initial letter of the verses follows the alphabetical order? Then let him recite Psalm cxix. which contains an eight-fold alphabetical order! No, the reason is that it contains the verse, "Thou openest Thy hand and satisfiest every living thing with favour" (Ps. cxlv. 16)[8]. Then let him say the Great Hallel[9] which includes "Who giveth food to all flesh" (ibid. cxxxvi. 25)! But [Psalm cxlv. is selected] because it contains both features. 

R. Johanan[1] said: Why is there no verse beginning with the letter N in that Psalm ? Because it would refer to the downfall of Israel's enemies[2]; as it is written, "Fallen (Naphelah) is the virgin of Israel, she shall no more rise" (Amos v. 2). In the West[3] they interpret the verse thus: "She is fallen, but she shall no more fall; rise, O virgin of Israel." Rab Nahman b. Isaac said : Even so, David refers to it and finds support for Israel in the Holy Spirit; as it is said, "The Lord upholdeth all that fall" (Ps. cxlv. 14). 

R. Eleazar b. Abina [also] said : What is declared of [the angel] Michael is greater than what is declared of Gabriel ; for of Michael it is written, "Then flew unto me one of the Seraphim" (Is. vi. 6), but of Gabriel it is written, "The man Gabriel whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly[4], approached close to me about the time of the evening offering" (Dan. ix. 21). How is it to be inferred that "one of the Seraphim" means Michael ? R. Johanan said : By comparing the occurrence of the word "one"[5] in the following passages: In Isaiah it is written, "Then flew unto me one of the Seraphim," and elsewhere it is written, "But, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me" (ibid. x. 13). It has been taught : Michael flew in one flight, Gabriel in two, Elijah in four, and the Angel of Death in eight; but in the time of plague [the Angel of Death flies] in one. 

R. Joshua b. Levi said : Although a man has read the Shema' in the Synagogue, it is a pious act to read it again upon his bed. R. Assi[6] said : What is the Scriptural authority for this ? "Tremble and sin not ; commune with your own heart upon your bed, and [[fol. 5a.]] be still. Selah " (Ps. iv. 5). Rab Nahman added : In the case of a disciple of the wise[7], this is not necessary. But Abbai said: Even the disciple of the wise should recite a verse of supplication; for instance, "Into Thy hand I commit my spirit. Thou hast redeemed me, O Lord, Thou God of truth" (ibid. xxxi. 6). 

R. Levi b. Hamma[1] said in the name of R. Simeon b. Lakish: A man should always oppose [yargiz] the good impulse to the evil impulse[2] ; as it is said : "Tremble [rigzu] and sin not" (ibid. iv. 5). If he conquer it, well and good ; but if not, let him occupy himself with Torah ; as it is said, "Commune with your own heart" (ibid.)[3]. Should this gain him the victory, well and good; but if not, let him read the Shema' ; as it is said, "Upon your bed[4]." If he conquer it, well and good ; but if not, let him reflect upon the day of death; as it is said, "And be still[5]. Selah." 

R. Levi b. Hamma also said in the name of R. Simeon b. Lakish : What means that which is written, "And I will give thee the tables of stone, and the law and the commandment, which I have written, that thou mayest teach them" (Exod. xxiv. 12)? "Tables of stone," i.e. the Decalogue: "law," i.e. the Pentateuch; "commandment," i.e. the Mishnah ; "which I have written," i.e. the Prophets and Hagiographa; "that thou mayest teach them," i.e. the Gemara[6]. The verse teaches that all of them were given to Moses on Sinai[7]. 

R. Isaac[8] said : Whoever reads the Shema' upon his bed is as though he holds a two-edged sword in his hand[9]; as it is said, "Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged sword in their hand" (Ps. cxlix. 6). How is this inferred ? Mar Zotra (another version : Rab Ashe) said : From what precedes ; for it is written, "Let the saints exult in glory, let them sing for joy upon their beds" (ibid. v. 5), and this is followed by "Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged sword in their hand." 

R. Isaac also said : Whoever reads the Shema' upon his bed, the evil spirits flee from him ; as it is said, "And the sons of Reshef[1] fly upwards ['uf] " (Job v. 7). 'Uf means nothing else than Torah ; as it is said, "Wilt thou set [hata'if][2] thine eyes upon it? It is gone" (Prov. xxiii. 5). And Reshef means nothing else than "evil spirits"; as it is said, "The wasting of hunger, and the devouring of the fiery bolt [Reshef] and bitter destruction" (Deut. xxxii. 24)[3]. 

R. Simeon b, Lakish said : Whoever occupies himself with Torah, sufferings depart from him ; as it is said, "And the sons of Reshef fly upwards ['uf]." 'Uf means nothing else than Torah; as it is said, "Wilt thou set thine eyes upon it? It is gone." And Reshef means nothing else than "sufferings"; as it is said, "The wasting of hunger, and the devouring of the fiery bolt." R. Johanan said to him : Why, even school-children know that[4]; as it is stated, "And He said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, and wilt do that which is right in His eyes, and wilt give ear to His commandments, and keep all His statutes, I will put none of the diseases upon thee, which I have put upon the Egyptians ; for I am the Lord that healeth thee " (Exod. xv. 26) ! But[5], everyone who is able to occupy himself with Torah and does not do so, the Holy One, blessed be He, brings upon him dreadful sufferings to stir him ; as it is said, "I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, had no comfort [tob] ; and my pain was stirred" (Ps. xxxix. 3). "Comfort" means nothing else than Torah; as it is said, "For I give you good [tob] doctrine; forsake ye not My teaching " (Prov. iv. 2). 

R. Zera (another version : R. Hannina b. Pappa)[6] said : Come and see that the attribute of a human being differs from that of the Holy One, blessed be He. What is the attribute of a human being ? When a man sells a valued article to his fellow, the seller grieves[1] and the purchaser rejoices. But with the Holy One, blessed be He, it is not so. He gave the Torah to Israel and rejoiced[2]; as it is said, "For I give you good doctrine ; forsake ye not My teaching." 

Raba (another version : Rab Hisda)[3] said : Should a man see sufferings come upon him, let him scrutinise his actions ; as it is said, "Let us search and try our ways, and return unto the Lord" (Lam. iii. 40). If he has scrutinised his actions without discovering the cause, let him attribute them to neglect of Torah; as it is said, "Happy is the man whom Thou chastenest, and teachest out of Thy law" (Ps. xciv. 12). If he attributed them to neglect of Torah without finding any justification, it is certain that his sufferings are chastenings of love ; as it is said, "For whom the Lord loveth He correcteth" (Prov. iii. 12)[4]. 

Raba stated that Rab Sahorah said in the name of Rab Huna : Him in whom the Holy One, blessed be He, delighteth He crusheth with sufferings ; as it is said, "Yet it pleased the Lord to crush him by disease" (Is. liii. 10). It is possible to think that this is so even with one who does not receive the chastenings in a spirit of love : therefore there is a teaching to say, "To see if his soul would offer itself in restitution" (ibid.). Just as the trespass-offering[5] is brought voluntarily, so are the sufferings voluntarily received. If he accept them, what is his reward? "He will see his seed, prolong his days" (ibid.). More than that, his study [of Torah] will endure with him; as it is said, "The purpose of the Lord will prosper in his hand" (ibid.). 

R. Jacob b. Iddi and Rab Aha b. Hannina [differ in opinion]. One of them says : Those are to be considered chastenings of love which do not involve neglect of Torah; as it is said, " Happy is the man whom Thou chastenest, O Lord, and teachest him out of Thy law " (Ps. xciv. 12). The other declares : Those are to be considered chastenings of love which do not involve neglect of prayer; as it is written, "Blessed be God, Who hath not turned away my prayer, nor His mercy from me" (Ps. lxvi. 20)[1] R. Abba the son of R. Hiyya b. Abba said to them : Thus declared R. Hiyya b. Abba in the name of R. Johanan : Both of them are to be considered chastenings of love ; as it is said, "For whom the Lord loveth He correcteth" (Prov. iii. 12). But what does the phrase "and teachest him out of Thy law" (Ps. xciv, 12) intend to convey to us ? Read not telammedennu "and teachest him" but telammedennu "and teachest us[2]"; i.e., Thou teachest us this matter out of Thy law as a deduction[3] from the ordinance concerning "the tooth and eye[4]." Should the tooth or eye of a slave be injured, which is only one of the members of a man's body, he thereby obtains his freedom, how much more so with the sufferings which afflict the whole body of a man[5] ! 

This is in accord with the statement of R. Simeon b. Lakish who said: The word berit "covenant" is mentioned in connection with salt and also with chastenings. With salt, as it is written, "Thou shalt not suffer the salt of the covenant of Thy God to be lacking" (Lev. ii. 13); and with chastenings, as it is written, "These are the words of the covenant" (Deut. xxviii. 69)[6]. As with the "covenant" mentioned in connection with salt, it is salt which sweetens meat, so with the "covenant" mentioned in connection with chastenings, they are chastenings which purge all the iniquities of man. 

There is a teaching : R. Simeon b. Johai said : Three precious gifts did the Holy One, blessed be He, give to Israel, and all of them He gave only through the medium of suffering ; they are : Torah, the land of Israel, and the world to come. Whence is it deduced that Torah [was given through the medium of suffering]? As it is said : "Happy is the man whom Thou chastenest, O Lord, and teachest him out of Thy law " (Ps. xciv. 12). And the land of Israel ? For it is written, "As a man chasteneth his son, so the Lord thy God chasteneth thee" (Deut. viii. 5), which is followed by "For the Lord thy God bringeth thee into a good land" (ibid. V. 7). And the world to come ? For it is written, "For the commandment is a lamp, and the teaching is light, and reproofs of instruction' are the way of life" (Prov. vi. 23). 

A Tanna taught in the presence of R. Johanan : Whoever occupies himself with Torah and benevolent acts, or who buries his children, all his sins are forgiven him. R. Johanan said to him : [[fol. 5b.]] It is quite right with Torah and benevolent acts ; for it is written, "By mercy and truth iniquity is expiated" (Prov. xvi. 6) "mercy" means benevolent acts, as it is said, "He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life, prosperity and honour" (ibid. xxi. 21), and "truth" means Torah, as it is said, "Buy the truth, and sell it not" (ibid, xxiii. 23); but how know we that this is true of one who buries his children? A certain Elder taught in the name of R. Simeon b. Johai[2] : It is to be derived from the occurrence of the same word 'awon "iniquity" in the following passages : "By mercy and truth iniquity is expiated" (ibid. xvi. 6) and "Who recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children" (Jer. xxxii. 18)[3]. 

R. Johanan said : Plagues and childlessness are not to be considered chastenings of love. Are not plagues to be so considered? Lo, there is a teaching : Whoever is afflicted with any of four plague-symptoms[4] is to regard them as nothing but an altar of atonement[5] ! Yes, they may be considered an altar of atonement, but not chastenings of love. Or if thou wilt, I can say this is our teaching and that is theirs[6]. Or if thou wilt, I can say the latter teaching refers to when the plague affects a hidden part of the body and the other to the case where an exposed part is affected[1]. Is not childlessness to be considered [chastenings of love] ? What is meant [by childlessness] ? Is it to be supposed to refer to a man who had children but they died ? Lo, R. Johanan himself said, "This is the bone of my tenth son[2]!" Nay, the latter teaching refers to one who never had children, the other to one who has been bereft of his children. 

R. Hiyya b. Abba was ill and R. Johanan went in to visit him. He said to him, "Are thy sufferings dear to thee ?" "No," he replied, "neither they nor the reward they bring." R. Johanan said to him, "Give me thy hand." He gave him his hand and R. Johanan raised him[3]. 

R. Johanan was ill and R. Hannina went in to visit him. He said to him, "Are thy sufferings dear to thee?" "No," he replied, "neither they nor the reward they bring." R. Hannina said to him, "Give me thy hand." He gave him his hand and R. Hannina raised him. Why did not R. Johanan raise himself ? They answer : A prisoner does not release himself from the dungeon. 

R. Eleazar[4] was ill and R. Johanan went in to visit him. He saw that he was lying in a dark room, so he bared his arm and a brightness was radiated therefrom[5]. He then noticed that R. Eleazar was weeping. He said to him, "Why weepest thou? Is it because thou hast not applied thyself suflSciently to the study of Torah ? We have learnt that it matters not whether one does much or little, so long as he directs his heart to Heaven ! Is it because of [the lack of] food[6]? Not everyone has the merit of two tables[7]! Is it because of childlessness? This is the bone of my tenth son!" R. Eleazar answered him, "I weep because of this beauty[1] which will decay iu the earth." R. Johanan said to him, "Well dost thou weep on that account" ; and they both wept. After a while, he said to him, "Are thy sufferings dear to thee?" He replied, "Neither they nor the reward they bring." He said to him, "Give me thy hand." He gave him his hand and R. Johanan raised him. 

It happened to Rab Huna that four hundred flasks of wine turned sour. There visited him Rab Judah the brother of Rab Sala Hasida and other Rabbis. (Another version : Rab Adda b. Ahaba and other Rabbis.) They said to him, "The master[2] should look into his actions[3]." He answered them, "Have I aroused suspicion in your eyes?" They retorted, "Is the Holy One, blessed be He, to be suspected of passing an unjust judgment?" He said to them, "If there be anyone who has heard aught against me, let him speak out." They replied, "Thus have we heard, that our master has not given the vine-tendrils to his labourer[4]." He said to them, "Has he left me any of them ? He has stolen the lot!" They replied, "That is what the proverb tells : 'Steal from a thief and thou also hast a taste of it'[5]." He said to them, "I undertake to give him what is due." Some declare that thereupon the vinegar turned back into wine, but others say that vinegar became very dear and was sold at the price of wine. 

There is a teaching : Abba Benjamin said : Throughout my life I was most anxious about two things, viz., that my Tefillah should be recited before my bed, and that my bed should be placed between North and South. "That my Tefillah should be recited before my bed." What means "before my bed" ? Is it to be supposed that it was actually in front of the bed? But Rab Judah has said in the name of Rab (another version : R. Joshua b. Levi)[6]: Whence do we learn that when one prays, there should be nothing intervening between him and the wall? As it is said, "Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed" (Is. xxxviii. 2)[2]! Do not read "before my bed" but "near my bed[2]." "And that my bed should be placed between North and South[3]" ; for R. Hamma b. R. Hannina said in the name of[4] R. Isaac : Whoever places his bed between North and South will have male children[5] born to him ; as it is said, "And whose belly Thou fillest with Thy treasure[6], who have sons in plenty" (Ps. xvii. 14). Rab Nahman b. Issac said : Also, his wife will not miscarry; for it is here written, "Thou fillest with Thy treasure," and elsewhere it is written, "And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb" (Gen. xxv. 24). 

There is a teaching : Abba Benjamin said : Should two enter a Synagogue[7] to pray, and one of them finishing before the other does not wait for him but goes out, his prayer is torn in his face ; as it is said, "Thou tearest thy soul[8] in thine anger, shall the earth be forsaken for thee ?" (Job xviii. 4). More than that, he causes the Shekinah to depart from Israel ; as it is said, "Shall the Rock be removed out of its place?" (ibid.) "Rock" means nothing else than the Holy One, blessed be He; as it is said, "Of the Rock that begat thee thou wast unmindful" (Deut. xxxii. 18)[9]. [[fol. 6 a.]] Should he, however, wait for him, what is his reward ? R. Jose b. Hannina answered : He is worthy of the following blessings ; as it is said, "Oh that thou wouldst hearken to My commandments! Then would thy peace be as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea ; thy seed also would be as the sand, and the offspring of thy body like the grains thereof ; his name would not be cut off nor destroyed from before Me" (Is. xlviii. 18 f.). 

There is a teaching : Abba Benjamin said : Had the human eye been given the power of seeing them, no person could endure because of the evil spirits. Abbai[1] said : They outnumber us, and surround us like the ridge round a field. Rab Huna said : Every one of us has a thousand on his left hand and myriads on his right[2]. Raba[3] said : The crush at the public discourses[4] is due to them ; the knees grow fatigued because of them ; the wearing out of the clothes of the Rabbis is the consequence of their rubbing against them ; the feet are bruised by them. 

Who wishes to perceive their footprints[5] should take sifted ashes and sprinkle them around his bed. In the morning he will see something resembling the footprints of a cock[6]. 

Who wishes to see them should take the after-birth of a black she-cat[7], the offspring of a black she-cat, the first-born of a first-born, roast it in the fire, pulverise it, then fill his eyes with it, and he will see them. He must pour the powder into an iron tube and seal it with an iron signet, lest the evil spirits steal it. He must also seal its mouth, lest he come to harm. Rab Bebai b. Abbai did this ; he saw the evil spirits and was injured. The Rabbis prayed for him and he was cured. 

There is a teaching : Abba Benjamin said : A man's prayer is only heard [by God] when offered in a Synagogue[1] ; as it is said, "To hearken unto the song and to the prayer" (I Kings viii. 28) — where there is song, let there be prayer. 

Rabin b. Adda said in the name of R. Isaac : Whence is it that the Holy One, blessed be He, is found in the Synagogue ? As it is said, "God standeth in the godly congregation " (Ps. Ixxxii. 1 ). And whence is it that when ten assemble for prayer, the Shekinah is in their midst ? As it is said, "God standeth in the godly congregation[2]." And whence is it that when three sit and judge, the Shekinah is in their midst? As it is said, "In the midst of the judges[3] He judgeth" (ibid.). And whence is it that when two sit and occupy themselves with Torah, the Shekinah is in their midst ? As it is said, "Then they that feared the Lord spoke one with another[4]; and the Lord hearkened and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before Him for them that feared the Lord and that thought upon His name" (Mal. iii. 16). What means "and that thought upon His name"? Rab Assi[5] said : If a man contemplated fulfilling a commandment, and through compulsion did not perform it, the verse ascribes it to him as though he had done it. And whence is it that even if an individual sits and occupies himself with Torah, the Shekinah is with him ? As it is said, "In every place where I cause My name to be remembered I will come unto thee and will bless thee" (Exod. xx. 24). 

Since [the Shekinah is] even with one, why mention two ? With two, their words are written in the book of remembrance, but the words of an individual are not so recorded. Since [the Shekinah is] even with two, why mention three? Thou mightest argue that since the act of judging is merely for the sake of peace[6], the Shekinah does not come [in their midst], therefore he informs us that the administration of justice is equal to being occupied with Torah. Since [the Shekinah is] even with three, why mention ten ? With ten, the Shekinah precedes them[1] ; with three, it waits until they are seated [to try cases]. 

Rab Abin b. Rab Adda said in the name of R. Isaac[2] : Whence is it that the Holy One, blessed be He, lays Tefillin[3] ? As it is said, "The Lord hath sworn by His right hand, and by the arm of His strength" (Is. Ixii. 8). "By His right hand" means Torah ; as it is said, "At His right hand was a fiery law unto them" (Deut. xxxiii. 2); "by the arm of His strength" means Tefillin, as it is said, "The Lord will give strength unto His people" (Ps. xxix. 11). But whence is it that the Tefillin are a strength to Israel? As it is written, "And all the peoples of the earth shall see that the name of the Lord is called upon thee, and they shall he afraid of thee" (Deut. xxviii. 10); and there is a teaching: R. Eliezer the Elder says : This refers to the Tefillin worn on the head[4]. 

Rab Nahman b. Isaac asked Rab Hiyya b. Abin : What is written in the Tefillin of the Lord of the Universe ? He answered, "And who is like Thy people Israel, a nation one in the earth?" (I Chron. xvii 21). Does, then, the Holy One, blessed be He, glory in the praises of Israel ? Yes, for it is written, "Thou hast avouched the Lord this day" (Deut. xxvi. 17) and "The Lord hath avouched thee this day " (ibid. v. 18). The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, "You have made Me the only object of your love[5] in the world, so I shall make you the only object of My love in the world." "You have made Me the only object of your love in the world" — as it is said, "Hear O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one" (ibid. vi. 4). "I shall make you the only object of My love in the world" — as it is said, "And who is like Thy people Israel, a nation one in the earth?" (I Chron. xvii. 21). 

Rab Aha b. Raba said to Rab Ashe : This is all very well with one case of the Tefillin ; what, however, of the other[6]? He answered : [It contains the following[1] :] "For what great nation is there," etc. (Deut. iv. 7), "And what great nation is there," etc. (ibid, v. 8), "Happy art thou, O Israel " etc. (ibid, xxxiii. 29), "Or hath God assayed to go" etc. (ibid. iv. 34), and "To make thee high above all nations" etc. (ibid. xxvi. 19). If so, it will have too many partitions[2] ! Nay, "For what great nation is there" and "And what great nation is there," which are very similar, are in one partition; "Happy art thou, O Israel" and "Who is like Thy people Israel" in one ; "Or hath God assayed to go" in one ; and "To make thee high above all nations" in one[3]. 

[[fol. 6 b.]] Rabin b. Rab Adda said in the name of R. Isaac : If one is accustomed to attend the Synagogue regularly and absents himself one day, the Holy One, blessed be He, makes inquiry about him ; as it is said, "Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of His servant, that walketh in darkness and hath no light?" (Is. 1. 10). If [his absence is because] he went to perform a religious duty, he will have light ; but if he went to attend to some secular business, he will have no light. "Let him trust in the name of the Lord" (ibid.). For what reason [is the light denied him][4] ? Because he should have trusted in the name of the Lord, but did not[5]. 

R. Johanan said : When the Holy One, blessed be He, enters a Synagogue and does not find there ten[6]. He is immediately filled with wrath ; as it is said, "Wherefore, when I came, was there no man ? When I called, was there none to answer ?" (ibid. v. 2)[7]. 

R. Helbo said in the name of Rab Huna : Whoever fixes a place for his prayer has the God of Abraham for his help : and on his death, it is said of him, "Where is the humble and pious man, of the disciples of our father Abraham !" Whence do we learn that our father Abraham fixed a place for his prayer ? For it is written, "And Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he had stood" (Gen. xix. 27). "Stood" means nothing else than prayer ; as it is said, "Then stood up Phineas and prayed" (Ps. cvL 30)[1]. 

R. Helbo [also] said in the name of Rab Huna : When leaving the Synagogue, one should not take large steps[2]. Abbai said: This refers only to leaving ; but to enter a Synagogue it is praise-worthy to hasten ; as it is said, "Let us eagerly strive to know the Lord" (Hos. vi. 3). 

R. Zera said : At first when I saw the Rabbis hastening to the study-session on the Sabbath, I thought they were desecrating the holy day[3]; but when I heard the statement of R. Tanhum, in the name of R. Joshua b. Levi : A man should always run to hear the Halakah discussed, even on the Sabbath, as it is said, "They shall walk after the Lord, who shall roar like a lion, for He shall roar, and the children shall come hurriedly from the West" (ibid. xi. 10), I also hastened. 

R. Zera said : The merit of attending the study-session lies in hastening thereto[4]. Abbai said : The merit of attending the discourse lies in the crush[5]. Raba said: The merit of studying [Torah] lies in the reasoning thereon[6]. Rab Pappa said: The merit of attending a house of mourning lies in maintaining silence[7]. Mar Zotra said : The merit of a fast consists in dispensing charity[8]. Rab Sheshet[9] said : The merit of listening to a funeral oration lies in raising [the voice in lamentation][10]. Rab Ashe[11] said : The merit of attending a wedding lies in addressing words [of felicitation to the bride and bridegroom]. 

Rab Huna said[1] : Whoever prays at the rear of a Synagogue is called wicked ; as it is said, "The wicked walk on every side" (Ps. xii. 9). Abbai said : This applies only to one who does not turn his face towards the Synagogue[2] ; but if he does that, we can have no objection. Once a man prayed at the rear of a Synagogue and did not turn his face in its direction. Elijah passed by, and seeing him thought that he was an Arab[3]. He said to him, "With thy back [to the Synagogue][4] standest thou before thy Master? " And drawing his sword, he slew him. 

One of the Rabbis said to Rab Bebai b. Abbai (another version : Rab Bebai said to Rab Nahman b. Isaac)[5] : What means, "When vileness is exalted [kerum] among the sons of men" (ibid.)? He answered : This refers to the things that stand in the height [rum] of the world[6] which are despised by men. R. Johanan and R. Eleazar [offer another explanation]. They both say : As soon as a man stands in need of the help of his fellow-creatures, his face changes like a Kerum ; as it is said, "Kerum is vileness to the sons of men." What is Kerum? When Rab Dimai came [from Palestine] he said[7], "There is a bird in the coast-towns[8] called Kerum[9], and when the sun shines, it changes into many colours." R. Ammi and R. Assi both say : [The man who needs help from his fellow-creatures] is as though he were sentenced to two penalties, viz., fire and water; as it is said, "Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads, we went through fire and water" (ibid. lxvi. 12)[1]. 

R. Helbo also said in the name of Rab Huna : A man should always be careful with the afternoon prayer, for behold, Elijah was only answered in the afternoon[2] prayer; as it is said, "And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the afternoon offering, that Elijah the prophet came near and said, O Lord, the God of Abraham.... Hear me, O Lord, hear me" (I Kings xviii. 36 f.). The first "Hear me" means : that fire may descend from heaven ; the second "hear me" means : that they may not say it is due 
to sorcery. 

R. Johanan[3] said : Also with the evening prayer [must a man be careful] ; as it is said, "Let my prayer be set forth as incense before Thee, the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice" (Ps. cxli. 2). 

Rab Nahman b. Isaac said : Also with the morning prayer [must a man be careful] ; as it is said, "O Lord, in the morning shalt Thou hear my voice ; in the morning will I order my prayer unto Thee, and will look forward" (ibid. v. 4). 

R. Helbo also said in the name of Rab Huna : Whoever partakes of the festivity of a bridegroom without felicitating him transgresses the five "voices" ; as it is said, "The voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that say. Give thanks to the Lord of Hosts" (Jer. xxxiii. 11). If he does felicitate him, what is his reward ? R. Joshua b. Levi said : He is worthy of Torah which was given amidst five "voices"; as it is said, "And it came to pass on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunders[4] and lightnings and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of a horn exceeding loud... and when the voice of the horn waxed louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice" (Exod. xix. 16 ff.). But it is not so; for it is written, "And all the people perceived the thunderings" (Exod. XX. 18)[1]! The "voices" referred to are those before the giving of the Torah. R. Abbahu said : [If he felicitates the bridegroom] it is as though he had brought a thanksgiving offering ; as it is said, "Even of them that bring offerings of thanksgiving into the house of the Lord" (Jer. l.c.). Rab Nahman b. Isaac said : It is as though he had rebuilt one of the ruins of Jerusalem ; as it is said, "For I will cause the captivity of the land to return as at the first, saith the Lord" (ibid.). 

R. Helbo also said in the name of Rab Huna : Every man in whom is the fear of God, his words are heard ; as it is said, "The end of the matter, all having been heard, fear God, and keep His commandments, for this is the whole man" (Eccles. xii. 13). What means "for this is the whole man"? R. Eleazar[2] answered : The Holy One, blessed be He, said, The whole universe was only created for his sake. R. Abba b. Kahana said : Such a man is equal in worth to the whole world. R. Simeon b. 'Azzai (another version: R. Simeon b. Zoma) said : The whole world has only been created to be subservient[3] to him. 

R. Helbo also said in the name of Rab Huna : Whoever is in the habit of greeting his neighbour, and omits to do so a single day, transgresses the injunction "Seek peace and pursue it" (Ps. xxxiv. 15)[4]. Should his neighbour greet him and he does not respond, he is called a robber ; as it is said, "It is ye that have eaten up the vineyard ; the spoil of the poor is in your houses" (Is. iii. 14). 

[[fol. 7 a.]] R. Johanan said in the name of R. Jose[5] : Whence is it that the Holy One, blessed be He, prays[6]? As it is said, "Even them will I bring to My holy mountain, and make them joyful in My house of prayer [lit. the house of My prayer]" (ibid. Ivi. 7). It is not said "their prayer" but "My prayer" ; hence we infer that the Holy One, blessed be He, prays. What does He pray? Rab Zotra b. Tobiah said in the name of Rab : "May it be My will that My mercy may subdue My wrath ; and may My mercy prevail over My attributes[1], so that I may deal with My children in the quality of mercy and enter on their behalf within the line of strict justice." 

There is a teaching : R. Ishmael b. Elisha said : Once I entered [the Holy of Holies][2] to offer incense in the innermost part of the Sanctuary, and I saw Okteriel[3], Jah, the Lord of Hosts, seated upon a high and exalted throne. He said to me, "Ishmael, My son, bless Me." I replied, "May it be Thy will that Thy mercy may subdue Thy wrath ; and may Thy mercy prevail over Thy attributes, so that Thou mayest deal with Thy children in the quality of mercy and enter on their behalf within the line of strict justice." And He nodded His head towards me[4]. We are thus informed that the blessing of a common person should not be esteemed lightly in thine eyes[5]. 

R. Johanan also said in the name of R. Jose : Whence is it that we should not try to appease a man in the time of his wrath[6]? As it is written, "My face shall go[7] and I will give thee rest" (Exod. xxxiii. 14). The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, "Wait for Me until My wrathful countenance shall have passed away, then I will give thee rest." 

Is there ever anger before the Holy One, blessed be He? Yes ; as there is a teaching : "A God that hath indignation every day" (Ps. vii, 12). But how long does His anger last ? A moment. And how long is a moment? A moment is one 58,888th[1] part of an hour ; and nobody has ever been able to fix upon just that moment with the exception of the wicked Balaam, of whom it is written, "He knoweth the knowledge of the Most High" (Num. xxiv. 16). 

Was Balaam, then, ignorant of the mind of his ass, and yet acquainted with the knowledge of the Most High? Nay; it teaches that he knew how to fix upon that moment in which the Holy One, blessed be He, is wrathful. This is the intention of the statement which the prophet made to Israel : "O My people, remember now what Balak king of Moab devised, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him . . .that ye may know the righteous acts of the Lord" (Micah vi. 5). What means "that ye may know the righteous acts of the Lord" ? R. Eleazar answered : The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, "Know ye how many are the righteous acts which I have wrought on your behalf, that I was not wrathful in the days of the wicked Balaam ; for had I been wrathful, there would not have been left any remnant of the enemies of Israeli[2]." That is the meaning of what Balaam said to Balak, "How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed ? And how shall I execrate, whom the Lord hath not execrated?" (Num. xxiii. 8). This teaches that during all those days He did not execrate. 

How long does His execration last? A moment. And how long is a moment? R. Abin (another version : R. Abina) said : The moment lasts as long as it takes to utter the word. Whence do we know that He is angry but for a moment? As it is said, "For His anger is but for a moment, His favour is for a life-time" (Ps. XXX. 6). Or if thou wilt, I can say it may be deduced from the following : "Hide thyself for a moment until the indignation be overpast" (Is. xxvi. 20). When is God angry? Abbai said : During the first three hours of the day when the comb of the cock is white and it stands on one foot. But[3] the comb is white at all times ! During the rest of the day there are many red streaks in it, but not at the afore-mentioned time. 

A certain Min[1], who lived in the neighbourhood of R. Joshua b. Levi, used to plague him with questions about [the interpretation of] the Scriptures. One day R. Joshua took a cock and placed it between the feet of his bed and watched [the comb] closely. His intention was to curse the heretic when the moment arrived [in which God was wrathful] ; but when the moment arrived, he was sleeping. On waking up[2] he said ; Learn from this that it is not proper to act thus ; for it is written, "His tender mercies are over all His works" (Ps. cxlv. 9), and "To punish is also not good for the righteous" (Prov. xvii. 26). 

It has been taught in the name of R. Meir : At the hour when the sun shines forth and all the kings of the East and West place their crowns upon their heads and worship it, at once the Holy One, blessed be He, is filled with wrath. 

Further said R. Johanan in the name of R. Jose : One chastisement in the heart of a man[3] is better than many lashes ; as it is said, "And she shall run after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them, and she shall seek them, but shall not find them ; then shall she say [in her heart], I will go and return to my first husband ; for then was it better with me than now " (Hos. ii. 9). R. Simeon b. Lakish said : It is better than a hundred lashes ; as it is said, "A rebuke entereth deeper into a man of understanding than a hundred stripes into a fool" (Prov. xvii. 10). 

R. Johanan also said in the name of R. Jose : Three things Moses sought of the Holy One, blessed be He, and He granted them. He sought that the Shekinah should rest upon Israel, and He granted it ; as it is said, "Is it not in that Thou goest with us?" (Exod. xxxiii. 16). He sought that the Shekinah should not rest upon the other peoples of the world[4], and He granted it ; as it is said, "So that we are distinguished, I and Thy people " (ibid.). He sought that God should show him His ways, and He granted it ; as it is said, "Show me now Thy ways" (ibid. V. 13). 

Moses said before Him[1], "Lord of the Universe, why is there a righteous man enjoying prosperity and a righteous man afflicted with adversity ? Why is there a wicked man enjoying prosperity and a wicked man afflicted with adversity?" He answered him, "Moses, the righteous man who enjoys prosperity is the son of a righteous father ; the righteous man who is afflicted with adversity is the son of a wicked father ; the wicked man who enjoys prosperity is the son of a righteous father ; the wicked man who is afflicted with adversity is the son of a wicked father." 

The teacher stated above: "The righteous man who enjoys prosperity is the son of a righteous father ; the righteous man who is afflicted with adversity is the son of a wicked father." But it is not so ; for lo, it is written, "Visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children" (Exod. xxxiv. 7) and it is also written, "The children shall not be put to death for the fathers" (Deut. xxiv. 16)! We set these verses one against the other and conclude there is no contradiction ; because the former passage refers to those children who continue in their fathers' ways[2], and the latter to those who do not continue in their fathers' ways. But [we may suppose that] God answered Moses thus wise, "The righteous man who enjoys prosperity is perfectly righteous ; the righteous man who is afflicted with adversity is not perfectly righteous ; the wicked man who enjoys prosperity is not perfectly wicked ; the wicked man who is afflicted with adversity is perfectly wicked[3]." 

This[4] is opposed to the teaching of R. Meir ; for R. Meir said that God granted two of Moses' requests and refused one. As it is said, "I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious" (Exod. xxxiii. 19), i.e. although he may not be deserving; "And I will show mercy on whom I will show mercy" (ibid.), i.e. although he may not be deserving[5]. 

"And He said, Thou canst not see My face" (ibid. v. 20). It has been taught in the name of R. Joshua b. Karhah : Thus spake the Holy One, blessed be He, to Moses, "When I was willing [that thou shouldest see My face] thou wert not willing[1] ; so now that thou art willing, I am not willing." This disagrees with the teaching of R. Samuel b. Nahmani in the name of R. Jonathan[2], viz. By virtue of three [meritorious acts] Moses became worthy of three [favours]. By virtue of "Moses hid his face" (Exod. iii. 6), he was granted the shining of his countenance (cf.ibid. xxxiv. 29 f.). By virtue of "For he was afraid" (ibid. iii. 6), he merited "And they were afraid to come nigh him" (ibid, xxxiv. 30). By virtue of "[He was afraid] to behold God" (ibid. iii. 6), he merited "The similitude of the Lord doth he behold" (Num. xii. 8). 

"And I will take away My hand, and thou shalt see My back" (Exod. xxxiii. 23). Rab Hanna[3] b. Bizna said in the name of R. Simeon Hasida : This teaches that the Holy One, blessed be He, showed Moses the knot of the Tefillin[4]. 

R. Johanan also said in the name of R. Jose : Any propitious utterance which issues from the mouth of the Holy One, blessed be He, though it be conditional, He does not retract [though the condition be not fulfilled]. Whence do we learn this ? From Moses our teacher; as it is said, "Let Me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven ; and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they" (Deut. ix. 14). Although Moses supplicated God against this decree and averted it, nevertheless He fulfilled [the blessing contained therein] in his seed ; as it is said, "The sons of Moses : Gershom and Eliezer" (I Chron. xxiii. 15), and then "And the sons of Eliezer were : Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer had no other sons ; but the sons of Rehabiah were very [lema'alah] many" (ibid. v. 17). On this Rab Joseph taught : They were upwards of [lema'alah] sixty myriads. One draws an analogy from the occurrence of the word rabah "many" in the following passages : here it is written, "they were very many," and elsewhere it is written, "And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and became very many" (Exod. i. 7)[5]. 

[[fol. 7 b. ]] R. Johanan said in the name of R. Simeon b. Johai : From the day that the Holy One, blessed be He, created the Universe, nobody called Him "Lord[1]" until Abraham came and so called Him ; as it is said, "And he said, O Lord God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?" (Gen. xv. 8). Rab said : Also, Daniel was only answered because of Abraham ; as it is said, "Now therefore, O our God, hearken unto the prayer of Thy servant, and to his supplications, and cause Thy face to shine upon Thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake" (Dan. ix. 17). It should have read "for Thy sake" ! But [he means] "for the sake of Abraham, who called Thee 'Lord'." 

R. Johanan also said in the name of R. Simeon b. Johai: Whence is it that we should not try to appease a man in the time of his wrath? As it is said, "My face shall go, and I will give thee rest" (Exod. xxxiii. 14)[2]. 

R. Johanan also said in the name of R. Simeon b. Johai: From the day that the Holy One, blessed be He, created the Universe, nobody praised Him until Leah came and praised Him ; as it is said, "This time will I praise the Lord" (Gen. xxix. 35). 

"Reuben" — [what means "Reuben"][3]? R. Eleazar answered : Leah said, "See the difference between[4] my son and the son of my father-in-law ; for the son of my father-in-law, although he voluntarily sold his birthright — as it is written, 'And he sold his birthright unto Jacob' (ibid. xxv. 33) — see what is written of him, 'And Esau hated Jacob' (ibid, xxvii. 41) and 'Is not he rightly called Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times' (ibid. V. 36). But as for my son, although Joseph forcibly deprived him of his birthright — as it is written, 'But, forasmuch as he defiled his father's couch, his birthright was given unto the sons of Joseph' (I Chron. v. 1 )[6] — nevertheless he was not jealous of him; for it is written, 'And Reuben heard it, and delivered him out of their hand' (Gen. xxxrii. 21)." 

"Ruth" — what means "Ruth"? R. Johanan said: Because she was worthy that David should issue from her, who delighted[1] the Holy One, blessed be He, with songs and praises. 

Whence do we learn that the name of a person affects his life[2]? R. Eleazar[3] said : Because the Scriptures declare, "Come, behold the works of the Lord, Who hath made shammot ['desolations'] in the earth" (Ps. xlvi. 9). Read not shammot but shemot "names." 

R. Johanan also said in the name of R. Simeon b. Johai : More painful is filial impiety in a man's house than the wars of Gog and Magog[4]; as it is said, "A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son" (ibid. iii. 1), after which it is written, "Lord, how many are mine adversaries become ! Many are they that rise up against me" (ibid. v. 2), But in connection with the wars of Gog and Magog it is written, "Why are the nations in an uproar? And why do the peoples mutter in vain?" (ibid. ii. 1); but it is not written, "How many are mine adversaries become!" 

"A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son" (ibid. iii. 1). "A Psalm of David"! Rather should we have expected "A Lament of David"! R. Simeon b. Abishalom said : A parable : To what is it like ? To a man to whom it is said, "To-morrow a bill of debt will be issued against thee." Before he sees it, he worries; but having seen it, he rejoices[5]. So was it likewise with David. When the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, "Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house" (II Sam. xii. 11), he grieved; for he said, "Perhaps it refers to a slave or illegitimate child who will have no pity on me." When, however, he found that it was Absalom, he rejoiced; and therefore he uttered a Psalm. 

R. Johanan also said in the name of R. Simeon b. Johai : It is permissible to contend with the wicked[6] in this world; as it is said, "They that forsake the law praise the wicked, but such as keep the law contend with him" (Prov. xxviii, 4). There is a teaching to the same effect : R. Dostai b. R. Mattun said : It is permissible to contend with the wicked in this world ; as it is said, "They that forsake the law praise the wicked," etc. Should a man try to mislead thee, saying, Lo, it is written, "Contend not with evil-doers, neither be thou envious against them that work unrighteousness" (Ps. xxxvii 1), answer him, Only he whose conscience pricks him[1] speaks thus. Nay, "Contend not with evil-doers" means, to emulate them; "be not envious against them that work unrighteousness" means, to be like them. And so it is stated, "Let not thy heart envy sinners, but be in the fear of the Lord all the day" (Prov. xxiii. 17). 

But it is not so ! For behold, R. Isaac has said : If thou seest a wicked man upon whom fortune smiles[2], do not contend with him ; as it is said, "His ways prosper at all times" (Ps. x. 5). More than that, [if thou contendest with him] he will be justified, in judgment; as it is said, "Thy judgments are far above out of his sight" (ibid.). More even than that, he will see his desire on his enemies[3]; as it is said, "As for his enemies, he puffeth at them" (ibid.)!
 
There is no contradiction : R. Isaac speaks of one who is wicked in his personal affairs, the other[4] of one who is wicked in religious matters[5]. Or if thou wilt, I can say that both refer to religious matters, and still there is no contradiction ; for R. Isaac may be taken to mean the wicked upon whom fortune smiles, and the other the wicked upon whom fortune does not smile. Or if thou wilt, I can say that both refer to the wicked upon whom fortune smiles, and still there is no contradiction; for R. Johanan may be understood as speaking of a perfectly righteous man [contending with the wicked], and the other of one who is not perfectly righteous. For Rab Huna said : What means that which is written, "Wherefore lookest Thou, when they deal treacherously, and holdest Thy peace, when the wicked swalloweth up the man that is more righteous than he"? (Hab. i. 13). Does, then, the wicked swallow up the righteous? And lo, it is written, "The Lord will not leave him in his hand" (Ps. xxxvii. 33) and "There shall no mischief befall the righteous" (Prov. xii. 21)! Nay; "the wicked swalloweth up the man that is more righteous than he," but a perfectly righteous man he doth not swallow up. Or if thou wilt, I can say that when fortune smiles upon him, it is different[1]. 

R. Johanan also said in the name of R. Simeon b. Johai : Whoever fixes a place for his prayer[2], his enemies fall beneath him; as it is said : "And I will appoint a place for My people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be disquieted no more ; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more as at the first" (II Sam. vii. 10). Rab Hunt asked : It is written here "to afflict them," but in the parallel passage (I Chron. xvii. 9) it is written "to exterminate them[3]"! The answer is: At first "to afflict them" and finally "exterminate them." 

R. Johanan also said in the name of R. Simeon b. Johai : Greater is the service of Torah[4] than its study : as it is said, "Elisha the son of Shaphat is here, who poured water on the bands of Elijah" (II Kings iii. 11). It is not mentioned that he studied [with Elijah] but that he poured water. That teaches that its service is greater than its study. 

Rab Isaac asked Rab Nahman, "Why does not the master[5] come to the Synagogue to pray ?" He answered, "I am not able [through indisposition]." He said to him, "Then the master should gather ten together and pray [with a quorum]." He replied, "It is too great a trouble for me." "Then the master should tell the messenger of the congregation at the time when the congregation prays to come and inform him[6]." He asked him, "But why all this?" He answered, "Because R. Johanan said in the name of R. Simeon b. Johai : What means that which is written, 'But as [[fol 8a.]] for me, let my prayer be unto Thee, O God, in an acceptable time' (Ps. Ixix. 14)? When is an 'acceptable time'? At the time when the congregation prays." R. Jose b. R. Hannina derived it from the following : "Thus saith the Lord, In an acceptable time have I answered thee" (Is. xlix. 8). R. Aha b. R. Hannina[7] derived it from the following : "Behold, God despiseth not the mighty" 

(Job xxxvi. 5)[1]; and it is written, "He hath redeemed my soul in peace so that none came nigh me ; for they were many with me" (Ps. Iv. 19)[2]. There is a teaching to the same effect : R. Nathan said : Whence is it that the Holy One, blessed be He, does not reject the prayer offered by many[3]? As it is said, "Behold, God despiseth not the mighty"; and it is written, "He hath redeemed my soul in peace so that none came nigh me ; for they were many with me." The Holy One, blessed be He, said, "Whoever occupies himself with Torah, practises benevolent acts and prays with the congregation, I ascribe it to him as though he had redeemed Me and My son [Israel] from [exile] among the peoples of the world." 

R. Simeon b. Lakish said : Whoever has a Synagogue in his town, and does not enter it to pray, is called "an evil neighbour"; as it is said, "Thus saith the Lord, As for all Mine evil neighbours, that touch the inheritance which I have caused My people Israel to inherit" (Jer. xii. 14). More than that, he causes exile to come upon himself and his sons ; as it is said, "Behold, I will pluck them up from off their land, and will pluck up the house of Judah from among them" (ibid.). 

It was said to R. Johanan[4], "There are old men to be found in Babylon." He was astonished and exclaimed, "It is written 'that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, upon the land' (Deut. xi. 21); but not outside the land [of Israel] !" When they told him that [the old men] are in the Synagogue early and late, he said, "It is this which helps them [to live long]." This is like what R. Joshua b. Levi said to his sons : Rise early and stay up late to enter the Synagogue, so that you may prolong your life. R. Aha b. R. Hannina[5] asked, What is the Scriptural authority for this ? "Happy is the man that hearkeneth to Me, watching daily at My gates, waiting at the posts of My doors" (Prov. viii. 34), after which it is written, "For whoso findeth me findeth life" (ibid. v. 35). Rab Hisda said : A man should always enter two doors in the Synagogue and then pray ; as it is said, "Waiting at the posts of My doors[1]." "Two doors" [literally], dost imagine ! But say [the meaning is], A man should penetrate into the Synagogue a distance which equals the width of two doors, and then offer prayer[2]. 

"For this let every one that is godly pray unto Thee in the time of finding" (Ps. xxxii. 6). R. Hannina said: "In the time of finding" refers to [the choice of] a wife ; as it is said, "Whoso findeth a wife findeth a great good" (Prov. xviii. 22). In the West[3] when a man marries, they say to him, "Masa' or Mose' ?" — Masa', as it is written, "Whoso findeth [masa'] a wife findeth a great good"; Mose', as it is written, "And I find [mose'] more bitter than death the woman" etc. (Eccles. vii. 26). 

R. Nathan[4] said : "In the time of finding" refers to Torah; as it is said, "For whoso findeth me findeth life, and obtaineth favour of the Lord" (Prov. viii. 35). 

Rab Nahman b. Isaac said : "In the time of finding [meso']" refers to death ; as it is said, "The issues [tosa'ot] of death" (Ps. Ixviii. 21). There is a teaching to the same effect : Nine hundred and three varieties of death have been created in the world ; as it is said, "The issues of death." Tosa'ot has that numerical value[5]. The severest of them all is croup, and the lightest is the kiss of death. Croup is like a thorn in a ball of clipped wool which tears backwards[6]. Others say it is like the whirling waters at the entrance of a canal[7]. The kiss of death is like taking a hair out of milk[8]. 

R. Johanan said : "In the time of finding" refers to burial. R. Hannina' said: What is the Scriptural authority for this? "Who rejoice unto exultation and are glad, when they can find the grave" (Job iii. 22). Rabbah b. Rab Shela said : Hence the popular saying : "Let a man pray for peace even to the last shovelful of earth[2]." 

Mar Zotra said : "In the time of finding" refers to a privy[3]. In the West, they said that the interpretation of Mar Zotra was the best of all. 

Raba said to Rafram b. Pappa : Let the master tell us some of those excellent things which thou reportest in the name of Rab Hisda, relating to the Synagogue. He replied, Thus said Rab Hisda : What means that which is written, "The Lord loveth the gates of Zion [Siyyon] more than all the dwellings of Jacob" (Ps. Ixxxvii. 2)? The Lord loveth the gates distinguished [mesuyyanim] for Halakah more than Synagogues and Houses of Study. That agrees with what R. Hiyya b. Ammi said in the name of 'Ulla : Since the day the Temple was destroyed, there is left to the Holy One, blessed be He, in His Universe the four cubits of Halakah alone[4]. And Abbai said ; At first I used to study at home and pray in Synagogue, but after hearing the statement of R. Hiyya b. Ammi in the name of 'Ulla — "Since the day the Temple was destroyed, there is left to the Holy One, blessed be He, in His Universe the four cubits of Halakah alone" 

I only pray where I study. R. Ammi and R. Assi, although there were thirteen[5] Synagogues in Tiberias[6], used to pray only between the pillars where they studied. 

R. Hiyya b. Ammi said in the name of 'Ulla : Greater is he who enjoys the fruit of his labour than the fearer of Heaven ; for with regard to the fearer of Heaven it is written, "Happy is the man that feareth the Lord" (ibid. cxii. 1), but with regard to him who enjoys the fruit of his labour it is written, "When thou eatest the labour of thy hands, happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee" (ibid, cxxviii. 2) — "happy shalt thou be" in this world, "and it shall be well with thee" in the world to come[1]. It is not written, "and it shall be well with thee" about the fearer of Heaven. 

R. Hiyya b. Ammi also said in the name of 'Ulla : A man should always reside in the same place as his teacher, for so long as Shimei the son of Gera[2] lived, Solomon did not marry the daughter of Pharaoh. But there is a teaching : A man should not reside [in the same place as his teacher]! There is no contradiction ; the former referring to the pupil who submits to his master, the latter to him who does not[3]. 

Rab Huna b. Judah stated that R. Menahem said in the name of R. Ammi : What means that which is written, "They that forsake the Lord shall be consumed" (Is. i. 28)? This refers to one who leaves a Scroll of the Law [unrolled][4] and goes out [from the Synagogue]. R. Abbahu used to go out between man and man[5]. Rab Pappa asked : How is it between verse and verse [may one go out]? The question remains [unanswered]. Rab Sheshet used to turn his face [away from the Scroll] and study, saying, "We with ours, they with theirs[6]." 

Rab Huna b. Judah stated that R. Menahem said[7] in the name of R. Ammi : A man should always finish his Parashah with the congregation, twice the Hebrew text and once the Targum[8] — [[fol. 8b.]] even "Ataroth and Dibon" (Num. xxxii. 3)[1] — for whoever finishes his Parashah with the congregation, his days and years are prolonged. Rab Bebai b. Abbai thought to complete the Parashot of the whole year on the eve of the Day of Atonement; but Hiyya b. Rab of Difti[2] taught him : It is written, "Ye shall afflict your souls, in the ninth day of the month at even" (Lev, xxiii. 32). Do we fast on the ninth ? Surely it is on the tenth that we fast ! But the intention is to tell thee that whoever eats and drinks on the ninth, the Scriptures ascribe it to him as though he fasted on the ninth and tenth[3]. He then thought to anticipate [the reading of the Parashot]; but a certain Elder said to him ; We have learnt that one should neither anticipate nor postpone [the reading of the Parashot]; as R. Joshua b. Levi said to his sons, "Finish your Parashot with the congregation, twice the Hebrew text and once the Targum; and also be careful to sever the jugular vein [of a bird when slaughtering] in accord with the opinion of R. Judah — for there is a Mishnaic teaching : R. Judah says : [One must cut] until he severs the jugular vein — and be careful [to honour] an old man, who has forgotten his learning involuntarily[4]: for we say that both the whole tables of stone and the pieces of the broken tables were placed in the Ark[5]." 

Raba said to his sons : When you cut meat, do not cut it upon your hand — some say, on account of danger[6], others, on account of spoiling the meal[7] — and do not sit upon the bed of an Aramaean[8] woman ; and do not pass behind a Synagogue[9] at the time when the congregation is at prayer. [He advised them] not to sit upon the bed of an Aramaean woman[1]. Some say he meant, Do not lie down to sleep without first reading the Shema'[2]; others explain he meant, Do not marry a proselyte; but others declare that he really meant an Aramaean woman, because of what happened to Rab Pappa. For Rab Pappa went to the house of an Aramaean woman, who brought out a couch for him and told him to be seated. He said to her, "I will not sit down until thou raisest up the couch." They lifted it up and found a dead child there. On this account the Sages say : It is forbidden to sit upon the bed of an Aramaean woman. [His advice] "Do not pass behind a Synagogue at the time when the congregation is at prayer" supports the teaching of R. Joshua b. Levi who said[3]: It is forbidden a man to pass behind a Synagogue at the time when the congregation is at prayer, Abbai said: This only applies when the building has no other entrance ; but should it have another entrance, we can have no objection ; further it applies only when there is no other Synagogue [in the town], but should there be another Synagogue, we can have no objection ; further it applies only to one who is not carrying a load, or is not running, or is not wearing Tefillin ; but in any of such cases, we can have no objection[4]. 

There is a teaching : R. 'Akiba said : For three things I admire the Medes : When they cut up meat, they only do so upon the table ; when they kiss, they only kiss on the hand ; and when they hold a consultation, they only do so in a field[5]. R. Adda b. Ahabah said : What Scriptural authority is there for this ? "And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field" (Gen. xxxi. 4). 

There is a teaching : Rabban Gamaliel[6] said : For three things I admire the Persians : They are temperate with their food, modest in the privy, and modest in another matter[7]. "I have commanded My consecrated ones" (Is. xiii. 3). Rab Joseph taught : These are the Persians who are consecrated and destined for Gehinnom[8]. 

Rabban Gamaliel said : Until the rise of dawn. 

Rab Judah said in the name of Samuel : The Halakah is in accord with Rabban Gamaliel. There is a teaching : R. Simeon b. Johai said : There are times when a man reads the Shema twice in a night, once before the rise of dawn and once after the rise of dawn, and thereby fulfils his obligation both for the day and night. This is self-contradictory ! Thou sayest, "There are times when a man reads the Shema' twice in a night"; consequently, after the rise of dawn is still night ! And it continues, "The man thereby fulfils his obligation both for the day and night" ; consequently, it is day ! No ; it is certainly still night ; and that he calls it "day" is because there are people who rise at that early hour[1]. Rab Aha b. Hannina said in the name of R. Joshua b. Levi : The Halakah is in accord with R. Simeon b. Johai. 

There are some who apply the statement of Rab Aha b. Hannina to the following : There is a teaching : R. Simeon b. Johai said in the name of R. 'Akiba : There are times when a man reads the Shema' twice in a day, once before sunrise and once after sunrise, and thereby fulfils his obligation both for the day and night. This is self-contradictory ! Thou sayest, "There are times when a man reads the Shema' twice in a day"; consequently, before sunrise is day ! And it continues, "The man thereby fulfils his obligation [[fol. 9a.]] both for the day and night" ; consequently it is still night ! No ; it is certainly day, and that he calls it "night" is because there are people who retire to rest at that hour[2]. Rab Aha b. R. Hannina said in the name of R. Joshua b. Levi : The Halakah is in accord with R. Simeon who spoke in the name of R. 'Akiba. R. Zera said : This is so, only one does not say, "Cause us, O Lord our God, to lie down[3]." 

When Rab Isaac b. Joseph came [from Palestine], he said : The statement of Rab Aha b. R. Hannina in the name of R. Joshua b. Levi was not explicitly said but was inferred. For it happened that two Rabbis became intoxicated at the marriage feast of R. Joshua b. Levi's son, and they omitted to read the Shema'[4]. They came before R. Joshua b. Levi who said : R. Simeon is worthy that one should rely upon bis opinion in a time of emergency. 

It once happened that his sons returned from a feast, etc. 

Before then, had they never heard this teaching of Rabban Gamaliel ? But they spoke to him thus : The Rabbis differ from thee, and where an individual differs from the many, the Halakah is in accord with the many. Or perhaps, the Rabbis agree with thee, and the reason that they declare [that the evening Shema' may be read] "Until midnight" is in order to keep a man far from transgression ? He answered them. The Rabbis hold the same view as myself, and you are under the obligation [to read the Shema']; and the reason they say "Until midnight" is to keep a man far from transgression. 

And not only in this connection do they so decide. 

But did Rabban Gamaliel say "Until midnight" that he teaches "and not only in this connection do they so decide[1]"? Nay, thus spake Rabban Gamaliel to his sons : Even according to the Rabbis who say "Until midnight," the obligation continues until the rise of dawn ; and the reason they say "Until midnight" is to keep a man far from transgression. 

The duty of burning the fat, etc. 

But he does not mention the eating of the Paschal offering[2]! And I quote against the Mishnah: The reading of the evening Shema', and Hallel on the Passover night, and the eating of the Paschal offering — their obligation continues until the rise of dawn ! Rab Joseph said : There is no contradiction ; the statement of the Mishnah being the view of R. Eleazar b. 'Azariah, the other the view of R. 'Akiba. For there is a teaching : "And they shall eat the flesh in that night" (Exod. xii. 8). R. Eleazar b. 'Azariah said, "Here it is stated, 'in that night' and the same phrase occurs in 'For I will go through the land of Egypt in that night' (ibid. V. 12) ; as in the latter passage it means 'until midnight', so also in the former it means 'until midnight'." R. 'Akiba said to him, "But has it not already been stated, 'Ye shall eat it in haste' (ibid. v. 11) — i.e. until the time of hastening[3]?" R. Eleazar b. 'Azariah asked[4], "If so, why is there a teaching to state 'in that night'?" R. 'Akiba answered[1], "One might otherwise have thought that the Paschal offering could be eaten like the other holy offerings during the day ; therefore there is a teaching to state 'in that night,' meaning it must be eaten at night, not during the day." According to R. Eleazar b. 'Azariah who uses the argument of Gezerah Shawah[2], it is quite right that it was necessary to state "in that night"; but how does R. 'Akiba explain the word "that[3]"? [He declares] that its purpose is to exclude the following night ; for it might have occurred to thee to say that since the Paschal offering belongs to the class of things holy in a minor degree[4], and peace offerings are in the same category, as the peace offerings might be eaten within two days and a night, so also the Paschal offering might be eaten two nights instead of two days, and therefore might be eaten any time during two nights and one day ! Therefore it informs us "in that night," i.e. it must be eaten that night and no other. And R. Eleazar b. 'Azariah[5]? He deduces that from "And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning" (Exod. xii. 10). And R. 'Akiba[6]? If one deduced it from this passage, I might have said, Which "morning"? The second morning ! And R. Eleazar[7]? He would answer thee, "Morning," used generally, means only the first morning. 

These Tannaim are like those other Tannaim[8]; for there is a teaching : "There shalt thou offer the Passover-offering at even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt" (Deut. xvi. 6). R. Eliezer said : "At even" thou shalt sacrifice ; "at the going down of the sun" thou shalt eat it ; "at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt" thou shalt burn [the remainder][9]. R. Joshua said: "At even" thou shalt sacrifice ; "at the going down of the sun" thou shalt eat it ; and how long mayest thou continue eating it? Until "the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt[1]." 

R. Abba[2] said : Everybody admits that the Israelites were only redeemed from Egypt at even ; as it is said, "The Lord thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night" (ibid. v. I); but they actually left Egypt by day ; as it is said, "On the morrow after the Papsover, the children of Israel went out with a high hand " (Nam. xxxiii. 3). What is the point of disagreement? The time of "hastening." R. Eleazar b. 'Azariah holds that it refers to the haste of the Egyptians[3]; but R. 'Akiba holds that it refers to the haste of the Israelites[4]. There is a teaching to the same effect : "The Lord thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night" (Deut. xvi. 1). Was it in the night they went out? Surely they went out during the day ; as it is said, "On the morrow after the Passover the children of Israel went out with a high hand" (Num. xxxiii. 3) ! But this teaches that the redemption began for them at even. 

"Speak now [na'] in the ears of the people" etc. (Exod. xi. 2). In the school of R. Jannai they said : The word [na'] always expresses a request. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, "I request thee. Go and say to the Israelites : I beg of you to ask of the Egyptians vessels of silver and vessels of gold, so that the righteous one[5] shall not say, 'And they shall serve them, and they shall afflict them' (Gen. xv. 13) He did fulfil in them, but 'and afterward shall they come out with great substance' (ibid. v. 14) He did not fulfil in them." They answered Moses, "Would that we could escape with our lives!" A Parable: [It may be likened] to a man who was imprisoned in a dungeon, and people came to tell him, "To-morrow thou wilt be released from the dungeon and be presented with a large sum of money." He replies to them, "I beg of you to release me to-day, and I ask for nothing more." 

"They let them have what they asked" (Exod. xii. 36). R. Ammi said : This teaches that they let them have what they asked against their will. Some explain : Against the will of the Egyptians; but others explain ; Against the will of the Israelites. Those who say it was against the will of the Egyptians, because it is written, "And she that tarrieth at home divideth the spoil" (Ps. Ixviii. 13)[1]. Those who say it was against the will of the Israelites, because of the burden[2]. 

"And they despoiled Egypt" (Exod. xii. 36). R. Ammi said : This teaches that they made it like a fort without provisions[3], R. Simeon b. Lakish said : They made it like a pond without fish. 

"I am that I am" (ibid. iii. 14). R. Ammi said[4]: The Holy One, blessed be He, spake to Moses, "Go, say to the Israelites, I was with you in this servitude, and I will be with you in the servitude of the kingdoms[5]." He said before Him, "Lord of the Universe, sufficient is the evil in its time[6]." The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, "Go say to them, I am[7] hath sent me unto you" (ibid.). 

"Hear me, O Lord, hear me " (I Kings xviii. 37)[8]. R. Abbahu said: Why did Elijah exclaim "Hear me" twice? This teaches that Elijah spake before the Holy One, blessed be He, "Lord of the Universe, hear me, that fire may descend from heaven and consume all that is upon the altar; and hear me, that Thou mayest divert their mind so that they say not it was the effect of sorcery; as it is said, 'For Thou didst turn their heart backward' (ibid.)." 


MISHNAH II 

From what time may the Shema' be read in the morning ? From the time that one can distinguish between blue and white[1]. R. Eliezer says : Between blue and green. And he may finish it any time until sunrise. R. Joshua says : Until the third hour, for so is the custom of kings to rise at the third hour. He who reads from that time onward incurs no loss, for he is to be regarded as one reading in the Torah[2]. 

GEMARA 

What is to be understood by "between blue and white"? Is it to be supposed between a lump of white wool and a lump of blue wool ? That can be distinguished also at night ! But it means, between the blueness in it and the whiteness in it[3]. 

There is a teaching : R. Meir says : [The morning Shema' is to be read] from the time one can distinguish between a wolf and a dog. R. 'Akiba says : Between an ass and a wild ass. Others say : When he can see an associate of his at a distance of four cubits[4] and recognise him. Rab Huna said : The Halakah is in accord with the "others." Abbai said: [The Halakah is] in accord with the "others" with respect to the Tefillah[5]; but with respect to the Shema' it is in accord with the Wetikin[6]. For R. Johanan said: The Wetikin used to conclude it with the sunrise. There is a teaching to the same effect : The Wetikin used to conclude it with the sunrise in order to unite the Geullah with the Tefillah[7], and consequently pray in the day. R. Zera siiid : What is the Scriptural authority foe this? "They shall fear Thee with the sun[1], and before the moon, throughout all generations" (Ps. Ixxii. 5). 

R. Jose b. Eliakim testified in the name of the Holy Congregation of Jerusalem[2]: Whoever unites the Ge'ullah with the Tefillah will meet with no mishap all that day. R. Zera exclaimed, "But it is not so! For lo, I united them but mishap befel me!" He asked him, "What was the mishap? That thou didst carry myrtle into the king's palace[3]? Why, thou shouldest even have offered some reward to be privileged to behold a king. For R. Johanan has said : A man should always be eager to run to meet a king of Israel ; and not only to meet an Israelite king, but even a king of the other nations, for if he be worthy, he will distinguish[4] between the kings of Israel and the kings of other peoples." 

R, El'ai[5] said to 'Ulla : When thou goest up there [to Palestine], make inquiries about the welfare of my brother, Rab Berona, in the presence of the whole college ; for he is a great man and rejoices in [the performance of] the commandments. On one occasion he united the Ge'ullah with the Tefillah, and laughter did not cease from his mouth all that day. 

How was he able to unite them? For lo, R, Johanan has said : At the commencement of the Tefillah one should say "O Lord, open Thou my lips" (Ps. li. 17) and at the conclusion "Let the words of my mouth etc." (ibid. xix. 15)[6] ! R. Eleazar said : [R. Johanan's statement] refers to the Tefillah of the evening. But R. Johanan has said : Who will inherit the world to come? He who unites the Ge'ullah of the evening to the Tefillah of the evening[7]! R. Eleazar said : Then it must refer to the Tefillah of the afternoon service. Rab Ashe[8] said : Thou mayest even suppose that it refers to all of them ; for, since the Rabbis instituted it[1] in the Tefillah it is to be considered as part thereof. If thou dost not admit this, how could one unite them in the evening, since one has to say the prayer "Cause us, O Lord our God, to lie down[2]"! But since the Rabbis instituted that prayer, it is considered part of the Ge'ullah ; and so here also, since the Rabbis instituted "O Lord, open etc." in the Tefillah, it is to be considered part thereof. 

Since the verse : "Let the words of my mouth be acceptable before Thee" might with equal propriety be said at the conclusion or the commencement [of the Tefillah], why did the Rabbis institute it at the end of the Eighteen Benedictions? Let it be said at the commencement! R. Judah, the son of R. Simeon b. Pazzi, answered : Since David only says this verse after eighteen Psalms, therefore the Rabbis arranged it at the end of the Eighteen Benedictions. How so eighteen Psalms — there are nineteen[3]! "Happy is the man" (Ps. i. 1) and "Why are the nations in an uproar" (ibid. ii. 1) form one Psalm[4]. For R. Judah, the son of R. Simeon b. Pazzi, has said : David composed one hundred and three Psalms, and did not say Hallelujah until he had seen the overthrow of the wicked ; as it is said, "Let sinners cease out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless the Lord, O my soul. Hallelujah" (ibid, civ, 35). How so one hundred and three Psalms — there are one hundred and four! But infer from this that "Happy is the man" and "Why are the nations in an uproar" are one Psalm. For R. Samuel b. Nahmani said in the name of R. Jonathan[5]: Every Psalm which was dear to David he opened [[fol. 10 a.]] with "Happy" and concluded with "Happy." He opened with "Happy" as it is written, "Happy is the man" (ibid. i. 1 ) and concluded with "Happy" as it is written, "Happy are all they that take refuge in Him" (ibid. ii. 12). 

There were some lawless men[6] living in the neighbourhood of R. Meir, and they used to vex him sorely. Once R. Meir prayed that they should die. His wife, Beruriah[7], exclaimed, "What thinkest thou? Is it because it is written, 'Let sinners cease out of the earth'? But has the text hoteim? It is written hata'im[1]. Glance also at the end of the verse, 'And let the wicked be no more' — i.e. when 'sins will cease,' then 'the wicked will be no more.' Rather shouldest thou pray that they repent and they be no more wicked." R. Meir offered prayer on their behalf and they repented. 

A Min said to Beruriah : It is written, "Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear" (Is. liv. 1 ). Is the woman to sing because she did not bear? She answered him, "Fool, glance at the end of the verse ; for it is written, 'For more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith the Lord[2].' But what means, 'barren woman, thou that didst not bear '? Sing, O community of Israel, who art like a barren woman that hath not borne children for Gehinnom — like you." 

A Min said to R. Abbahu : It is written "A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son" (Ps. iii. 1) and also "Of David, Michtam ; when he fled from Saul, in the cave" (ibid. Ivii. 1). Which incident happened first? Surely the incident of Saul happened first ; then he should record it first ! He replied : For you who do not use the rule of juxtaposition[3] it is a difficulty, but not for us who do make use of it. For R. Johanan[4] said : Whence is the rule of juxtaposition derived from the Torah? As it is said : "Semukim[5] for ever and ever, they are done in truth and righteousness" (ibid. cxi. 8). Why, then, is the Psalm concerning Absalom (Ps. iii) next to the Psalm concerning Gog and Magog (Ps. ii)[6]? So that should anybody ask thee, "Is there a slave that rebels against his master[7]?" do thou ask him, "Is there a son who rebels against his father?" The latter has happened, and similarly will the former happen. 

R. Johanan said in the name of R. Simeon b. Johai : What means that which is written, "She openeth her mouth with wisdom, and the law of kindness is on her tongue" (Prov. xxxi. 26) ? Of whom does Solomon say this? He said it of no one else than David his father, who dwelt in five worlds and composed songs [in each]. He dwelt in the womb of his mother and composed a song ; as it is said, "Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that I am within[1], bless His holy name" (ibid. ciii. 1). He issued forth into the air of the world, gazed at the stars and planets, and composed a song; as it is said, "Bless the Lord, ye angels of His, ye mighty in strength, that fulfil His word, hearkening unto the voice of His word. Bless the Lord, all ye His hosts, etc." (ibid. vv. 20 f.). He sucked at his mother's breast, gazed at her nipples, and composed a song ; as it is said, "Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all His benefits" (ibid. v. 2). What means "all His benefits[2]"? R. Abbahu said : [It means] that He placed her breast in the place of understanding[3]. For what reason? Rab Judah said : So that [the child] may not gaze at the place of nakedness. Rab Mattena said : So that it should not have to suck from a part of the body which is foul. David looked upon the overthrow of the wicked and composed a song ; as it is said, "Let sinners cease out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless the Lord, O my soul. Hallelujah" (ibid. civ. 35). He reflected on the day of death and composed a song ; as it is said, "Bless the Lord, O my soul : O Lord my God, Thou art very great, Thou art clothed with glory and majesty" (ibid. v. 1). How is it understood that this verse speaks of the day of death? Rabbah b. Rab Shela answered : From the continuation ; as it is written, "Thou hidest Thy face, they vanish ; Thou withdrawest their breath, they perish, and return to the dust" (ibid. v. 29). 

Rab Shimi b. 'Ukba (another version : Mar 'Ukba) was frequently in the company of R. Simeon b. Pazzi who[4] used to arrange the Aggadah in the presence of R. Joshua b. Levi[5]. He asked him : What means that which is written, "Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless His holy name" (ibid. ciii. I)? He replied : Come and see that the attribute of man is not like the attribute of the Holy One, blessed be He. It is an attribute of man to draw a figure on a wall, but he is unable to endow it with breath and soul, with inward parts and bowels. But with the Holy One, blessed be He, it is not so. He draws a figure within a figure, and endows it with breath and soul, with inward parts and bowels. That is what Hannah said, "There is none holy as the Lord, for there is none beside Thee ; neither is there any rock like our God" (I Sam. ii, 2). What means "there is no rock [sur] like our God"? [It means] "there is no designer [sayyar] like our God." What means "for there is none beside Thee"? R. Judah b. Menasya said : Read not en bilteka" there is none beside Thee," but en Ieballoteka "there is none to outlast Thee." For not like the attribute of the Holy One, blessed be He, is the attribute of the human being. With the human being, his works outlast him ; but the Holy One, blessed be He, outlasts His works. 

He said to him[1] : I tell thee as follows : These five "Bless the Lord, O my soul" — with reference to whom did David compose them ? He composed them with reference to none other than the Holy One, blessed be He, and the soul. As the Holy One, blessed be He, fills the whole world, so also the soul fills the whole body. As the Holy One, blessed be He, sees but cannot be seen, so also the soul sees but cannot be seen. As the Holy One, blessed be He, nourishes the whole world, so also the soul nourishes the whole body. As the Holy One, blessed be He, is pure, so also the soul is pure. As the Holy One, blessed be He, dwells in the inmost part [of the Universe], so also the soul dwells in the inmost part [of the body][2]. Let him in whom are these five qualities come and praise Him Who possesses these five qualities. 

Rab Hamnuna said : What means that which is written, "Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation [pesher] of a thing?" (Eccles. viii. 1)? [It means]. Who is like the Holy One, blessed be He, Who knows how to make a reconciliation [pesharah] between the two righteous men, Hezekiah and Isaiah. Hezekiah said, "Let Isaiah come to me, for so we find that Elijah went to Ahab ; as it is said, 'And Elijah went to show himself unto Ahab' (I Kings xviii. 2)." Isaiah said, "Let Hezekiah come to me, for so we find that Jehoram, son of Ahab, went to Elisha" 

(II Kings iii. 12). What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He brought sufferings upon Hezekiah and said to Isaiah, "Go and visit the sick[1]" ; as it is said, "In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah, the prophet, the son of Amoz came to him and said to him. Thus saith the Lord, Set thy house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live" (Is. xxxviii. 1). What means "For thou shalt die, and not live"? — "for thou shalt die" in this world, "and not live" in the world to come. He asked him, "Why all this [severe punishment]?" He replied, "Because thou hast not performed the duty of begetting children[2]." Hezekiah said to him, "The reason is that I have seen by the aid of the Holy Spirit[3], that worthless children will issue from me." Isaiah asked him, "What hast thou to do with the secrets of the All-merciful? What thou hast been commanded thou shouldest perform, and let the Holy One, blessed be He, do whatever is pleasing to Him." Hezekiah said to him, "Then give me thy daughter; perhaps my merit and thine will have effect, and worthy children will issue from me." He replied, ["Lo, I have brought thee the message 'Set thy house in order' and thou sayest to me 'Give me thy daughter'!][4] The verdict [of death] has already been decreed against thee!" He said to him, "Son of Amoz, end thy prophecy and go! For thus has it been handed down to me from my forefather[5]: Even if a sharp sword be laid upon a man's neck, let him not despair of [the divine] mercy." It has been similarly reported : R. Johanan and R. Eleazar[6] both said : Even if a sharp sword be laid upon a man's neck, let him not despair of [the divine] mercy, as it is said, "Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him" (Job xiii. 15). R. Hanan said : Even if the lord [[fol. 10 b.]] of dreams[7] inform a man that he will die on the morrow, he should not despair of [the divine] mercy; as it is said, "For through the multitude of dreams and vanities there are also many words ; but fear thou God" (Eccles. v. 6)[1], Immediately, "Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall [kir] and prayed unto the Lord" (Is. xxxviii. 2). What means kir? R. Simeon b. Lakish said: [He prayed][2] from the chambers [kirot] of his heart; as it is said, "My bowels, my bowels! I writhe in pain! the chambers of my heart, etc." (Jer. iv. 19). R. Levi[3] declared : [He prayed][2] in connection with the "wall," saying before Him, "Lord of the Universe, if Thou didst bring back to life the child of the Shunammite woman who but made 'a little chamber on the roof[4],' how much more so [shouldest Thou spare my life], seeing that my forefather Solomon overlaid the whole Temple with silver and gold!" 

"Remember now, O Lord, I beseech Thee, how I have walked before Thee in truth and with a whole heart, and have done that which is good in Thy sight" (Is. xxxviii. 3). What means "I have done that which is good in Thy sight"? Rab Judah said in the name of Rab : He joined the Ge'ullah to the Tefillah[5]. R. Levi said : He hid the Book of Remedies[6]. 

The Rabbis have taught : Six acts did King Hezekiah perform ; of three [the Rabbis] approved, and of three they disapproved. Of three they approved, viz. he hid the Book of Remedies, and they approved; he broke the brazen serpent[7], and they approved; he dragged his father's bones upon a bed of ropes[8], and they approved. But of three of his acts they disapproved, viz. he stopped up the waters of Gihon[9], and they disapproved ; he cut down the doors of the Temple and sent them to the King of Assyria[10], and they disapproved ; he intercalated Nisan in Nisan[1], and they disapproved. Did not Hezekiah know of the teaching, "This month shall be unto you the beginning of months" (Exod. xii, 2), i.e. this month and none other shall be Nisan[2]? But he erred in the teaching of Samuel who said : We do not intercalate the year on the 30th day of Adar, since that day may possibly be fixed as Nisan. Hezekiah thought that we do not say "since that day may possibly be fixed as Nisan[3]." 

R. Johanan said in the name of R. Jose b. Zimra : Whoever refers to his own merit [when praying], the merit of others is referred to [in the answer to the petition]; and whoever refers to the merit of others, his own merit is referred to. Moses referred to the merit of others; as it is said, "Remember Abraham, Isaac and Israel, Thy servants" (ibid, xxxii. 13), and his own merit was referred to ; as it is said, "Therefore He said that He would destroy them, had not Moses His chosen stood before Him in the breach, to turn back His wrath, lest He should destroy them" (Ps. cvi. 23). Hezekiah referred to his own merit; as it is written, "Remember now, O Lord, I beseech Thee, how I have walked before Thee" (Is. xxxviii. 3), and the merit of others was referred to ; as it is said, "For I will defend this city, for Mine own sake, and for My servant David's sake" (ibid, xxxvii. 35). This agrees with the statement of R. Joshua b. Levi who said : What means that which is written, "Behold, for my peace I had great bitterness" (Is. xxxviii. 17)? Even when the Holy One, blessed be He, sent him peace, it was bitter for him[1].

"Let us make, I pray thee, a little chamber on the roof" (II Kings iv. 10)[2]. Rab and Samuel [discuss its meaning]. One says : It was an open chamber which they roofed in ; the other says : It was a large verandah' which they divided into two [by erecting a wall]. This is all very well according to him who says it was a verandah, since it is written kir "a wall" ; but for him who says it was an upper chamber, what means kir? He takes it to mean "they roofed it." It is all very well according to him who says it was an upper chamber, since it is written 'aliyyah "upper chamber" ; but for him who says it was a verandah, what means 'aliyyah? He takes it to mean the finest [me'ullah] of the rooms. 

"And let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool and a candlestick" (ibid.). Abbai (another version : Rab Isaac[4]) said : Whoever wishes to take advantage [of an offer of hospitality] may do so like Elisha ; and whoever does not wish to accept may do so[5] like Samuel of Ramah ; as it is said, "And his return was to Ramah, for there was his house" (I Sam. vii. 17)[6], and R. Johanan[7] said : Wherever he went, he took his house with him. 

"And she said to her husband. Behold now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God" (II Kings iv. 9). R. Jose b. R. Hannina said : From here [we learn] that a woman can better estimate [the character of] a guest than a man. 

"A man of God[8]." How did she know it? Rab and Samuel [offer explanations]. One says: She never saw a fly pass over his table[1]; the other says: She spread a linen sheet upon his bed and never found it stained with seminal emission. 

"A holy man." R. Jose b. R. Hannina said : He is holy, but not his servant : as it is said, "Gehazi came near to thrust her away" (ibid. v. 27). R. Simeon b. Lakish[2] said: He seized her by the breast[3]. 

"That passeth by us continually" (ibid. v. 9). R. Jose b. R. Hannina said in the name of R. Eliezer b. Jacob : Whoever invites a disciple of the wise as a guest to his house and lets him enjoy his possessions, the Scriptures ascribe it to him as though he had brought continual offerings[4]. 

R. Jose b. R. Hannina also said in the name of R. Eliezer b. Jacob : Let not a man stand on an elevated place and pray, but let him pray in a lowly place[5]; as it is said, "Out of the depths have I called Thee, O Lord" (Ps. cxxx. 1 ). There is a teaching to the same effect : Let not a man stand upon a chair, or a stool, or any elevated place to pray, but let him pray in a lowly place, because there can be no haughtiness before the Omnipresent ; as it is said, "Out of the depths have I called Thee, O Lord," and it is said, "A prayer of the afflicted, when he fainteth" (ibid. cii. 1). 

R. Jose b. R. Hannina also said in the name of R. Eliezer b. Jacob : Whoever prays must direct his feet ; as it is said, "And their feet were straight feet" (Ezek. i. 7)[6]. 

[7]R. Jose b. R. Hannina also said in the name of R. Eliezer b. Jacob : What means that which is written, "Ye shall not eat with the blood" (Lev. xix, 26)? [It means], Ye shall not eat before you have prayed for your life'. There are some who declare that R. Isaac stated that R. Johanan said^ in the name of R. Eliezer b. Jacob : Whoever eats and drinks and afterwards otFers his prayers, concerning him the Scriptures say, "Thou hast cast Me behind thy back" (I Kings xiv. 9). Read not geweka "thy back," but geeka "thy pride." The Holy One, blessed be He, says, "After this person has exalted himself, he receives upon himself the kingdom of Heaven[3]." 

R. Joshua said : Until the third hour. 

Rab Judah said in the name of Samuel : The Halakah is in accord with R. Joshua. 

He who reads from that time onward incurs no loss. 

Rab Hisda said in the name of Mar 'Ukba : Provided he does not say "Blessed... Who formest light[4]." Against this view I quote : He who reads [the Shema'] from that time onward incurs no loss ; he is regarded as one reading in the Torah, but he must precede it with two benedictions and follow it with one ! This refutation of Rab Hisda's view remains unshaken. Some declare: Rab Hisda said in the name of Mar 'Ukba : What means he incurs no loss? He loses none of the benedictions[5]. There is a teaching to the same effect : He who reads [the Shema'] from that time onward incurs no loss ; he is regarded as one reading in the Torah, but he must precede it with two benedictions and follow it with one. R. Manni said : Greater is he who reads the Shema' in its proper time than one who occupies himself with Torah ; for the Mishnah states : He who reads from that time onward incurs no loss, he is regarded as one reading in the Torah ; hence it is to be deduced that he who reads [the Shema'] in its proper time is superior. 

MISHNAH III 

Bet Shammai say : In the evening a man should recline and read [the Shema'], and in the morning he should stand up [to read it] ; as it is said, "When thou liest down and when thou risest up" (Deut. vi. 7). But Bet Hillel say : A man reads it after his own manner[1]; as it is said, "And when thou walkest by the way" (ibid.). If so, why is it said, "When thou liest down and when thou risest up" ? [That means], At the time when people lie down and rise up. R. Tarphon said : I was once journeying by the way and I reclined to read [the Shema'], according to the view of Bet Shammai, and I placed myself in danger on account of robbers. They said to him : Thou didst justly incur a penalty for thyself, in that thou didst transgress the view of Bet Hillel. 

GEMARA

It is all very well that Bet Hillel explain their reasons and the reason of Bet Shammai ; but why do not Bet Shammai agree with Bet Hillel? Bet Shammai would tell thee : In that case[2], the text should read, "In the morning and at even" ; what means "When thou liest down and when thou risest up" ? At the time of lying down, there should be actual lying down [to read the Shema'], and at the time of rising up, there should be actual rising up. What, then, do Bet Shammai make of the phrase "and when thou walkest by the way"? This is required in accordance with the teaching : "When thou sittest in thy house" excludes one occupied with a religious duty; "and when thou walkest by the way" excludes a bridegroom[3]. Hence they say : He who takes a virgin to his house as wife is exempt [from the obligation of reading the Shema' on the night of his marriage] ; but if he marry a widow, he has that obligation. How is this demonstrated[4]? Rab Pappa said: Because [the text uses the word] "way" [we argue], Just as the way is voluntary, so all is voluntary[5]. 

Are we not here dealing with one who is on his way to perform a religious duty, and even so, the All-merciful requires of him the reading [of the Shema'][1]? In that case, the All-merciful should have written "when sitting and when walking." What means "when thou sittest and when thou walkest"? When sitting for thine own purpose and when walking for thine own purpose, thou art under the obligation [to read the Shema'] ; but when it is the performance of a religious duty, thou art exempt. If so, even one who takes a widow as wife should also [be exempt][2] ! The man [who marries a virgin] is anxious[3]; the other is not. Should the reason [of exemption] be on account of anxiety, then it ought also to apply to one whose ship has sunk at sea ! Shouldest thou say that he likewise is exempt, why does R. Abba b. Zabda declare in the name of Rab : A mourner[4] is under the obligation to observe all the commandments mentioned in the Torah except Tefillin, because they are called an adornment ; as it is said, "Bind thine adornment upon thee" (Ezek. xxiv. 17)? [No, there is a difference]; the former is troubled by the anxiety of a religious duty; but as for the latter, his anxiety is caused by some voluntary affair. And Bet Shammai[5]? They require it for the exclusion of messengers sent out in connection with a religious duty[6]. And Bet Hillel[7]? They answer that it is self-evident that they may read [the Shema'] while even on a journey. 

The Rabbis have taught : Bet Hillel say : When standing they may read [the Shema'], when sitting they may read, when reclining they may read, when walking by the way they may read, when doing work they may read. It once happened that R. Ishmael and R. Eleazar b. 'Azariah were dining in a certain place, the former reclining and the latter sitting upright. When the time for reading the Shema' arrived, R. Eleazar reclined[1] and R. Ishmael sat up. R. Eleazar b. 'Azariah said to R. Ishmael, "My brother, I will narrate a parable for thee. To what is this like? To one who is told 'Thy beard is well grown[2]' and he answers, 'Then it shall be taken in hand by the barbers[3].' So art thou ; all the time that I was sitting up thou wert reclining, but now that I have reclined[4] thou hast sat up !" He replied, "I have acted according to the teaching of Bet Hillel, and thou according to the teaching of Bet Shammai. Not only that, [I sat up] lest the disciples see this[5] and fix the Halakah for future generations." What means "not only that"? Shouldest thou say, "Bet Hillel also hold [that the Shema' may be read] in a reclining position!" that is so, but only when one was reclining from the first ; but in thy case, since hitherto thou has been sitting up and now thou reclinest, they will say, "We have to infer that [our teachers] agree with the opinion of Bet Shammai," and there is a fear, that the disciples seeing this, will fix the Halakah accordingly for future generations. 

Rab Ezekiel taught : If a man acted in accordance with the view of Bet Shammai, he has done [rightly] ; if in accordance with the view of Bet Hillel, he has done [rightly]. Rab Joseph said : If he acted in accordance with the view of Bet Shammai, he has done nothing at all. For there is a Mishnaic teaching : If the head and greater part of a man's body be in a Sukkah and his table inside his house[6], Bet Shammai pronounce it invalid, but Bet Hillel declare it valid. Bet Hillel said to Bet Shammai, "It once happened that the Elders of Bet Shammai and the Elders of Bet Hillel went to visit R. Johanan b. ha-Horanit and they found him with his head and the greater part of his body in the Sukkah and his table inside his house, but they said nothing to him." They asked them[7], "Is proof to be drawn from this? They certainly told him, 'If this be thy practice, never hast thou in thy life-time properly observed the commandment of Sukkah!' " 

Rab Nahman b. Isaac said : If one acted according to the view of Bet Shammai, he is worthy of death ; for we have learnt in our Mishnah: R. Tarphon said: I was once journeying by the way and I reclined to read [the Shema'] according to the view of Bet Shammai, and I placed myself in danger on account of robbers. They said to him : Thou didst justly incur a penalty for thyself, in that thou didst transgress the view of Bet Hillel. 

MISHNAH IV 

In the morning [the reading of the Shema'] is preceded by two benedictions and followed by one[1] ; in the evening it is preceded by two and followed by two[2], one long and one short. Where [the Rabbis] order to say a long benediction, it is not permissible to say a short one ; [where they order] to say a short benediction, it is not permissible to say a long one. [Where they order] to "seal " a benediction[3], it is not permissible not to "seal" ; [where they order] not to "seal," it is not permissible to "seal." 

GEMARA 

Which benedictions does one say [in the morning]? R. Jacob[4] [[fol. 11b.]] said in the name of R. Osha'ya : "[Blessed].... Who formest light and createst darkness[5]." Surely one ought rather to say : "Who formest light and createst brightness"! As it is written[6], so we say it. But in the case of the words "I make peace and create evil" (Is. xlv. 7), do we say them as they are written? It is written "evil," but [in the prayer] we say "all things[7]" ! It is an euphemism. Then in the former instance, let us [in the prayer] also use "brightness" [instead of "darkness"] as an euphemism ! Raba[8] answered : The purpose is to mention the characteristic of day at night and the characteristic of night in the day. It is quite right [about mentioning] the characteristic of night in the day, since we say "Who formest light and createst darkness" ; but where is [the mention of] the characteristic of day at night? Abbai answered : [We say] "Thou rollest away the light from before the darkness, and the darkness from before the lights[1]." 

Which is the other [blessing to be recited before the morning Shema']? Rab Judah said in the name of Samuel : "With abounding love[2]" ; and so R. Eleazar taught his son R. Pedat to say "With abounding love." There is a teaching to the same effect : We do not say "With everlasting love[3]," but "With abounding love." But the Rabbis declare that "With everlasting love" [is to be recited] ; for so it is said, "Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love ; therefore with affection have I drawn thee" (Jer. xxxi. 3). 

Rab Judah said in the name of Samuel : When one rises early to study [Torah], if he had not yet read the Shema', he must utter a benediction [prefatory to study] ; but should he have read the Shema', it is not necessary to utter a benediction, for he has freed himself from the obligation by having recited "With abounding love[4]." 

Rab Huna said : For the study of the Scriptures a benediction is necessary, but not for the study of Midrash. R. Eleazar said : For the study of the Scriptures and Midrash a benediction is required, but not for the study of the Mishnah. R. Johanan said : For the Mishnah it is also required, but not for the study of Talmud. Raba said : Also for the study of Talmud it is necessary to recite a benediction[5]. For Rab Hiyya b. Ashe said : On many occasions have I stood before Rab to study the chapters of the Sifra debe Rab[6] ; he first washed his hands, uttered a benediction, and then taught us the chapters. 

What was the benediction ? Rab Judah said in the name of Samuel: "[Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe], Who hast sanctified us by Thy commandments and commanded us to occupy ourselves with the words of Torah[1]." R. Johanan used to conclude thus : "Make pleasant, therefore, we beseech Thee, O Lord our God, the words of Thy Torah in our mouth and in the mouth of Thy people, the house of Israel, so that we with our offspring and the offspring of Thy people, the house of Israel, may all know Thy name and occupy ourselves with Thy Torah. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Who teachest Torah to Thy people Israel[2]." Rab Hamnuna[3] said : "[Blessed]... Who hast chosen us from all nations and given us Thy Torah. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Who givest the Torah[4]." Rab Hamnuna said : This is the choicest of benedictions. Rab Pappa said[5] : Therefore let one say them all.
 
We have learnt elsewhere in the Mishnah : The Temple-super-intendent[6] said [to the priests] "Utter one benediction," and they did so. They then read the Decalogue, "Hear, O Israel" etc. (Deut. vi. 4 ff.), "And it shall come to pass if ye shall hearken diligently" etc. (ibid. xi. 13 ff.), "And the Lord said" etc. (Num. xv, 37 ff.)[7]. After that they uttered with the people three benedictions, viz, "True and firm[8]," "Accept, O Lord our God[9]" and the Priestly Benediction[10]. On the Sabbath they added a benediction for the outgoing guard[11].

Which is the one benediction[12]? It so happened that R. Abba and R.Jose b. Abba[13] came to a certain place and were asked : Which is the one benediction? They were unable to answer ; so they went and questioned Rab Mattena, and he could not answer. They thereupon asked Rab Judah. He replied : Thus said Samuel : It is "With abounding love." But R. Zerika stated that R. Ammi said in the name of R. Simeon b. Lakish : It is "Who formest light." When Rab Isaac b. Joseph came [from Palestine], he said : The statement of R. Zerika was not explicitly made but was inferred ; for what R. Zerika stated that R. Ammi said in the name of R. Simeon b. Lakish was : This teaches that the benedictions do not invalidate one another[1]. Now it is quite right if thou maintainest that [the priests] recited "Who formest light" ; then it would follow that the benedictions do not invalidate one another, for they omitted "With abounding love." Shouldest thou, on the [[fol. 12 a.]] other hand, maintain that they recited "With abounding love," how would it follow that the benedictions do not invalidate one another? Perhaps the reason they omitted "Who formest light" was because it was not yet time for that prayer[2], and when the proper time arrived, they said it! And if this be an inference, what then[3]? It might have been inferred that it was certainly "With abounding love" that [the priests] recited, and when the proper time for reciting "Who formest light" arrived, they said it; and what means "The benedictions do not invalidate one another"? The order of the benedictions[4]. 

[The Mishnah quoted above states :] Then they read the Decalogue, "Hear, O Israel," "And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently," "And the Lord said," "True and firm," "Accept, O Lord our God," and the Priestly Benediction. Rab Judah said in the name of Samuel : Also beyond the confines of the Temple they wished to read [the Decalogue with the Shema'] but it had long been abolished because of the murmuring of the Minim[5]. There is a teaching to the same effect : R. Nathan said : Outside the Temple they wished to read [the Decalogue with the Shema'] but it had long been abolished because of the murmuring of the Minim. Rabbah b. Rab Huna[6] thought to establish it in Sura[1] ; but Rab Hisda told him it had been previously abolished because of the murmuring of the Minim. Amemar thought to establish it in Nehardea[2]; but Rab Ashe told him it had previously been abolished because of the murmuring of the Minim. 

[The Mishnah-quotation continues :] On the Sabbath they added a benediction for the outgoing guard. Which is this benediction ? R. Helbo said : The outgoing guard said to the incoming guard, "May He Who caused His name to dwell in this house make love and brotherhood, peace and comradeship, to abide amongst you." 

Where [the Rabbis] order to say a long benediction, it is not permissible to say a short one. 

It is evident that one who took a cup of wine, and thinking that it was beer, commenced saying the benediction on the supposition that it was beer, and then concluded the benediction for wine, has complied with the requirements of the law ; because even if he had said "[Blessed]... by Whose word all things exist[3]," he would also have complied with the requirements of the law. For there is a Mishnaic teaching : If one has uttered the benediction "By Whose word all things exist" over any kind of liquor, he has fulfilled his obligation. But if one took a cup of beer, and thinking it was wine began the benediction for wine and concluded with the benediction for beer, how is it then ? Do we follow the main theme of the benediction or its conclusion ?
 
Come and hear[4]: In the morning service, if one commences with "Who formest light" but concludes with "Who bringest on the evening twilight[5]," he has not complied with the requirements of the law. If he opened with "[ Blessed] . . . Who at Thy word bringest on the evening twilight" and concluded with "Creator of the luminaries[6]," he has so complied. In the evening service, if he opened with "Who at Thy word bringest on the evening twilight" and concluded with "Creator of the luminaries[7]," he has not so complied. If he opened with "Who formest light" and concluded with "Who bringest on the evening twilight[1]," he has so complied. The general rule in this matter is, therefore, that it defends upon the conclusion of the benediction[2]. But it is different here, because he has said "Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Creator of the luminaries[3]." That is quite right according to Rab who declares that a benediction which does not contain the Divine Name is no benediction. But, according to R. Johanan who holds that a benediction which does not contain a reference to the Divine Kingship is no benediction, what is there to say[4]? But since Rabbah b. 'Ulla has declared : "The purpose is to mention the characteristic of day at night and the characteristic of night in the day[5]," having uttered the benediction and the reference to the Divine Kingship from the commencement, he said them of both[6]. 

Come and hear : From the latter clause [of the quoted Baraita] "The general rule in this matter is that it depends upon the conclusion of the benediction" — what does "the general rule in this matter" intend to include? Is it not to include what we have mentioned[7]? No ; it is to include the instance of bread and dates. How is this to be understood ? Are we to suppose that it refers to one who ate bread and thinking that it was dates he had eaten, commences the benediction on the supposition it was dates, but concludes with the benediction for bread ? This is the same as the last-mentioned case[1]! No, [the "general rule"] is necessary for the following : If, for instance, one ate dates, and thinking it was bread, commenced with the benediction for bread but concluded with the benediction for dates, he has complied with the requirements of the law ; for even if he had concluded with the benediction for bread, he would also have so complied. What is the reason ? Because dates likewise nourish[2]. 

Rabbah b. Hinnana[3] the Elder said in the name of Rab : Whoever does not recite "True and firm" in the morning and "True and trustworthy[4]" in the evening has not fulfilled his obligation ; as it is said, "To declare Thy lovingkindness in the morning and Thy faithfulness in the night-seasons" (Ps. xcii. 3)[5]. 

Rabbah b. Hinnana [the Elder] also said in the name of Rab : When one prays [the Tefillah] and has to bow[6], he should bow at the word "Blessed" ; and when returning to the erect position, he should do so on mentioning the Divine Name. Samuel asked : What is Rab's reason ? Because it is written, "The Lord raiseth up them that are bowed down" (ibid, cxlvi. 8)[7]. Against this is quoted, "And from before My name he is afraid" (Mal. ii. 5)[8]! Is it written "at My name[9]"? No, "from before My name" is written. Samuel said to Hiyya b. Rab : O son of the Law, come and let me tell thee an excellent thing which thy father once said. Thus spake thy father : When one bows, he should do so at the word "Blessed" ; and when he returns to the erect position, he [[fol. 12 b.]]should do so on mentioning the Divine Name. When Rab Sheshet bowed, he did so like a twig[10] ; but when he returned to the erect position, he did so like a snake. 

Rabbah b. Hinnana the Elder also said in the name of Rab : During the whole year, one should in the Tefillah use the phrases "The holy God" and "King Who lovest righteousness and judgment[1]" ; except during the ten days from the New Year until the Day of Atonement, when he should substitute "The holy King" for the former and "King of judgment" for the latter. R. Eliezer said : Even if he used the phrase "holy God," he has complied with the requirements of the law ; as it is said, "But the Lord of hosts is exalted through justice, and the holy God is sanctified through righteousness" (Is. v. 16). When is "the Lord of hosts exalted through justice"? During the ten days from the New Year until the Day of Atonement, and yet it is stated thereby "the holy God" ! How is it, then, in this matter? Rab Joseph declared : "The holy God" and "King Who lovest righteousness and judgment" should be said[2]: Rabbah declared: "The holy King" and "King of judgment" should be said ; and the Halakah is in accord with Rabbah's view. 

Rabbah b. Hinnana the Elder also said in the name of Rab : Whoever has it in his power to pray" on behalf of his neighbour and fails to do so is called a sinner ; as it is said, "Moreover as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you" (I Sam. xii. 23). Raba[3] said : If [the neighbour] be a disciple of the wise, then it is necessary to grieve on his behalf [should he be in trouble]. What is the reason ? Are we to suppose it is because it is written, "There is none of you that is sorry for me or discloseth unto me" (ibid. xxii. 8)? Perhaps it is different in the case of a king[4]! Nay, [derive the reason] from the following : "But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth, I afflicted my soul with fasting ; and my prayer, may it return into mine own bosom" (Ps. xxxv. 13)[5]. 

Rabbah b. Hinnana the Elder also said in the name of Rab : Whoever commits a transgression and is filled with shame thereby, all his sins are forgiven him; as it is said, "That thou mayest remember and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more, because of thy shame; when I have forgiven thee all that thou hast done, saith the Lord God" (Ezek. xvi. 63). Perhaps it is different with a community[1]? Nay, [derive the reason] from the following: "And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed ; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams; therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do" (I Sam. xxviii. 15). Saul did not mention [having inquired through] the Urim and Tummim[2], because he put Nob, the city of the priests, to the sword[3]. Whence do we know that he was forgiven by God ? As it is said, "(And Samuel said unto Saul)[4], Tomorrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me" (ibid. V. 19); upon which R. Johanan comments, "with me" i.e. in my division[5]. The Rabbis [find that Saul was forgiven] in the following : "We will hang them up unto the Lord in Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of the Lord[6]" (II Sam. xxi. 6). A Bat Kol issued forth and proclaimed "The chosen of the Lord." 

R. Abbahu b. Zutarti said in the name of R. Judah b. Zebida[7]: It was sought to include the Parashah of Balak[8] in the reading of the Shema'. Why did they not do so? Because of the trouble [its length would cause] to the congregation. On what ground [did they wish to include it] ? Was it because it is written therein, "God Who brought them forth out of Egypt" (Num. xxiii. 22) ? Then let one say the Parashah of usury[9] or of weights[10] which likewise contains a reference to the exodus from Egypt ! Nay ; R. Jose b. Abin said : [The reason is] because it is written therein, "He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a lioness ; who shall rouse him up?" (ibid. xxiv. 9)[1]. Then let him say that verse and no more [if the whole is too lengthy] ! We have a tradition that any Parashah which Moses our teacher divided off, we may divide off; but a Parashah which he had not divided off, we may not. 

Why was the Parashah of Fringes[2] included [in the Shema']? R. Judah b. Habiba[3] said : Because there are five things contained therein : the command of fringes ; the exodus from Egypt ; the yoke of the commandments ; [a warning against] heretical opinions [Minut] ; lustful imagination and idolatrous longing. Quite right that three of these are explicitly stated therein ; viz. : the yoke of the commandments, as it is written, "That ye may look upon it and remember all the commandments of the Lord" (ibid. xv. 39) ; the command of Fringes, as it is written, "That they make for themselves fringes" (ibid. v. 38) ; the exodus from Egypt, as it is written, "I am the Lord your God, Who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God ; I am the Lord your God" (ibid. V. 41). But where is there reference to heretical opinions and lustful imagination and idolatrous longing ? There is a teaching[4] : "After your heart" (ibid. v. 39) means heresy; for thus the Scriptures state, "The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God" (Ps. xiv, 1). "After your own eyes" (Num. I.c.) means lustful imagination ; as it is said, "And Samson said unto his father. Get her for me, for she is pleasing in my eyes" (Judg. xiv. 3). "After which ye use to go astray" (Num. I.c.) means idolatrous longing; for thus the Scriptures state, "The children of Israel again went astray after the Baalim " (Judg. viii. 33). 

MISHNAH V 

The exodus from Egypt must be mentioned at night[5]. R. Eleazar b. 'Azariah said : Behold I am like one seventy years old[6], and I have never been worthy [to hear the reason] why the exodus from Egypt should he mentioned at night, until Ben Zoma expounded it [as follows]. It is said, "That thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life" (Deut. xvi. 3). [Had the Scriptures stated] "the days of thy life" [it would have meant] the days only ; but "all the days of thy life" [must be intended to include] the nights. The Sages explain the verse thus : "The days of thy life" signifies [thy life-time] in this world; "all" is to include the days of the Messiah. 

GEMARA 

There is a teaching : Ben Zoma said to the Sages : Will the exodus from Egypt be mentioned in the days of the Messiah ? Has it not long ago been declared, "Therefore behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that they shall no more say. As the Lord liveth, that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt ; but, as the Lord liveth, that brought up and that led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all the countries whither I had driven them" (Jer. xxiii. 7f.)? They answered him : [This passage does not mean] that the memory of the exodus from Egypt is to be obliterated, but that [the memory of the release from] the servitude of the kingdoms will be fundamental and the exodus of Egypt secondary to it. Take the following as an analogy: "Thy name shall no more be called Jacob, but [[fol 13 a. ]]Israel shall be thy name" (Gen. xxxv. 10). It is not intended that the name Jacob shall be obliterated[1], but that Israel will be fundamental and Jacob secondary. Similarly the Scriptures state, "Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old" (Is. xliii. 18) — "Remember ye not the former things," i.e. the servitude of the kingdoms, "neither consider the things of old," i.e. the exodus from Egypt. 

"Behold I will do a new thing ; now shall it spring forth" (ibid. V. 19). Rab Joseph taught : This refers to the war of Gog and Magog[2]. A parable : to what is this like ? To a man walking by the way, when a wolf attacked him and he was rescued from it ; then he is fond of relating his adventure with the wolf. [Later on] a lion attacked him and he was rescued from it ; so he is fond of relating his adventure with the lion. [After that] a serpent attacked him and he was rescued from it ; so he forgets his two previous adventures, and relates the incident of the serpent. So is it also with Israel ; later troubles cause the former to be forgotten. 

"Abram, the same is Abraham" (I Chron. i. 27). At first he was made the father of Aram, but subsequently the father of all the universe[1]. Sarai, the same is Sarah. At first she was made princess of her own people, but subsequently princess of all the universe[2] 

Bar Kappara taught : Whoever calls Abraham " Abram " transgresses a command ; as it is said, "Thy name shall be Abraham" (Gen. xvii. 5). R. Eliezer says: He transgresses a prohibition ; as it is said, "Thy name shall no more be called Abram" (ibid.). But now, can this also apply to one who calls Sarah "Sarai[3]"? In her case the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Abraham, "As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be" (ibid. v. 15)[4]. Does it likewise apply to one who calls Jacob "Jacob"? No; it is different here, because the Scriptures afterwards repeat [his old name] ; as it is written, "And God spoke unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob" (ibid. xlvi. 2). R. Jose b. Abin (others declare it was R. Jose b. Zebida) quoted in objection : "Thou art the Lord the God, Who didst choose Abram" (Neh. ix. 7) ! He was answered : In this passage the prophet narrates the praise of the All-merciful by reviewing what had happened from the beginning[5]. 

May we return to thee : From what time[6].
