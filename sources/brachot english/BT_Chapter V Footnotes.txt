4 That one may only pray in a serious frame of mind. 

5 I.e. put on his best garments. 

6 M. omits: in the name of Rabbab. The correct reading is probably: Rab; cf. Hyman, i. p. 104 b. 

7 In the worship of God.

1 And their influence will prevent me from exceeding due bounds. 

2 And not in merriment. 

3 See p. 182 n. 2. 

4 M. omits: the Small. 

5 From the punishment meted oat to the wicked after death. 

6 The above passages reflect the condition of mourning in which the Jews considered themselves to be after the overthrow of Temple and State. 

7 Because his mind would not be settled.

1 Corn must be winnowed before it becomes liable to the tithe. If unwinnowed, cattle may feed on it, but it may not be used for human consumption, without the tithe. 

2 M.: Ze'iri. 

3 Having committed me'ilah (see Lev. v. 15f.) because, being a non-priest, he utilised something that belonged to the Sanctuary. 

4 I.e. only permit one to pray in a serious frame of mind. 

5 I.e. permitted one to pray after discussing a Halakah which has been decided. 

6 So M. correctly. Edd. : grandson of. 

7 M.: Huna. 

8 Lit. "mouth of the river"; a fertile region near Nehardea; Neubauer, pp. 366 f. 

9 Lit. "between the palms" is, says Neubauer, loc. cit., probably the first halting-place in Babylonia proper. 

==================================================

----------
1 He means to imply that Adam decreed that those palms should grow there. 

2 According to Hyman, iii. p. 903a (see the parallel passage in Sotah 46b), this is the correct reading, not Rab Shimi b. Asbe as in edd. 

3 Possibly the town Agranum, situated on one of the tributaries of the Euphrates; Neubauer, p. 347. Wiesner, p. 71, identifies it with the modern Erzerum. 

4 Perhaps identical with the locality of Koufa in Babylon ; Neubauer, loc. cit. According to Wiesner, loc. cit., it is Mt Capotes near which the Euphrates has its source. 

5 A Babylonian locality in the neighbourhood of the last-mentioned place. There appears to be a lacuna in the text here, relating what happened on that occasion. 

6 See p. 194 n. 4. 

7 By detaining them. They would not resume the Service until the Rabbi had finished his Tefillah, and some of them might want to hurry away to their work.

1 See p. 26 n. 5. 

2 Considered ugly ; see below. 

3 What would be the utility of Hannah's ruse? 

4 The plan of Hannah was deduced from the use of the infinitive with the finite verb, "If looking Thou wilt look." If the deduction is not drawn, how is the double use of the verb to be accounted for? 

5 It is a common idiom, and no inference should be drawn therefrom. 

6 I.e. sins for which one is visited with death. 

7 See Mishnah Shab. ii. 6, Singer, p. 121. 

8 I.e. distinguished. 

9 Meaning, an average person, not conspicuous among others. 

==================================================
Page 209
----------
1 I have adopted the reading of M. *** (page:209) "dark," i.e. ugly, which offers the contrast to "ruddy," i.e. handsome. Edd. read *** (page:209) which means "a mute." Rashi explains it as "corpulent," but the word never seems to have that meaning. Some edd. add after it : nor blind. 

2 The ground for this inference is not clear. The explanation offered by the commentators (see Tosafot) is as follows: The word "by thee" *** (page:209) is spelt with a redundant letter *** (page:209) which has the numerical value of five. Hence it is taken to mean "I was within five [cubits] of thee," because one is not allowed to sit within four cubits of one who prays. 

3 A strictly forbidden action. 

4 What is the connection between the two clauses? 

5 Eli was potentially his teacher, since Samuel's mother had placed him in his charge. 

6 Lit. upon.

1 The only fast which is permitted on the Sabbath is that of the Day of Atonement. It speaks here of a voluntary fast as, e.g., after a dream of ill omen. 

2 Seventy years is the normal span of human life (Ps. xc. 10) and this will be shortened if one spoils "the day of delight" by fasting. Rashi explains differently in a favourable sense : If one adds to the severity of his fast by choosing the Sabbath day, then should there be a divine decree to his detriment, though it be incurred in extreme youth (seventy years ago), it will be annulled. 

3 I.e. 'al instead of el "unto." 

4 At the thought of the severity of their lot because of their guilt. "Enemies of Israel" is an euphemism for Israel.

2 M. : Eleazar. 

3 The Patriarchs. 

4 Moses alone. 

5 With his persistent pleading. Thus the verse is rendered "And Moses wore out the Lord." 

6 Wayyehal is here rendered "And Moses absolved the Lord [from His vow]."

----------
1 M.: Johanan. 

2 Connecting wayyehal with the root halal "to be slain." 

3 Wunsche, p. 51 n. 2, thinks that wayyehal is here to be interpreted as yahulu in II Sam. iii. 29. 

4 Or, the Great. 

5 The Aramaic equivalent of the Hebrew words for "fire of the bones," i.e. fever. 

6 Since it is Moses who is now speaking, the actual words of God being considered to end with the word "heaven." 

7 According to this interpretation, "And all this land" etc. is God's answer to Moses' reminder "And Thou saidst...heaven." 

==================================================

2 Pharaoh.

4 There follow on here seven teachings of R. Eleazar, and as an aid to the memory (also to prevent any from being lost in oral transmission) a mnemonic is inserted, giving the key-word of each. 

5 It was his prayer that obtained for him permission to view the land of promise. 

==================================================

1 In supplication. Since the text means that having rejected their sacrifices, God will even reject their supplications, it follows that prayer is of higher importance than the offering. 

2 To pronounce the priestly benediction. 

3 I.e. anticipates its fulfilment as a reward for its length. 

4 The word for "hope" is here connected with a root meaning "to pray."

1 M. adds : corresponding to the twelve tribes. 

2 Wiinsche, p. 53 n. 1, suggests that the namber 30 is to be connected with the number of days in the month. 

3 The words used here are the Aramaized forms of the Latin military terms: legio, numerus (*** is possibly a corruption of *** = ***), cohors, castra; cf. Krauss, pp. 574 f. On this passage see A. P. A. i. p. 396 n. 3, and Krauss in R. E. J. xxxix. pp. 57 f.

----------
1 By a change of vowels "Yea these may forget" becomes "Yea 'these' will be forgotten," i.e., the incident where Israel exclaimed "These are thy gods" (Exod. xxxii. 4). 

2 R.V. "Yet will I not forget thee," but the word "I" is emphasized in the Hebrew. Hence it is taken to refer to the incident at Sinai when God declared "I am the Lord thy God" (Exod. xx. 2). That will not be forgotten by Him. 

3 In silent meditation. 

4 Here the word "dwell" occurs after "they shall give thanks"; but in the former quotation it is followed by "They are ever praising Thee." 

5 There being three statutory Services daily.

1 Without constant study. 

2 So that they did not have to devote much time to it. 

3 The word annos is not clear. Since the parallel passage in J. T. reads the word for "ass," some (e.g. Pinner) connect it with ovos. If a Hebrew word, it means "a man of violence." M. reads: hegmon, i.e. ***. 

4 See p. 144 n. 7.

6 Coming towards him while he is saying the Tefillah. 

7 I.e. take all possible precautions. 

8 I.e. it is liable to become wild. 

9 See p. 113 n. 5. 

10 According to J. T. R. Hannina was saying the Tefillah when the lizard bit him. His disciples asked him whether he had been injured, but he replied that he had felt nothing. They found the lizard dead ; and the Rabbi's escape was accounted for by the assertion that when a lizard bites a man, if the man reaches water first, the lizard dies ; but if the lizard gets there first, the man dies. In Hannina's case, a spring of water miraculously opened at his feet, which sealed the fate of the lizard.

1 M. reads: Adda b. Ahabah. The parallel passage in Sanh. 92a reads: Rab Adda; and there is still another reading: Rab Adda of Kartignin (see p. 191 n. 8). 

2 So the Hebrew literally. 

3 Or, why is the Hebrew word for "vengeance" in the plural? 

4 According to Jewish tradition, the Great Assembly was a body which came into existence in the time of Ezra, received the Torah from the prophets (cf. Abot I. 1, Singer, p. 184), and initiated many developments in Judaism (see J. E. xi. pp. 640 ff.). Modern criticism has thrown doubt upon this tradition (see Schurer ii. i. pp. 354 f.) and the existence of such a body is questioned. But see Abrahams, Pharisaism and the Gospels, p. 9.

2 There being no mention in the Mishnah of any opposition to his view. 

3 When a Festival begins with the termination of the Sabbath, they agree with R. Eliezer that the "Division" is included in the "Thanksgiving"; but not when the Sabbath is followed by an ordinary week-day. 

4 In the Mishnah he maintains that the "Division" is not included in any of the benedictions, but is a separate benediction. 

==================================================
Page 224
----------
1 Viz. the three introductory and three concluding benedictions of the Tefillah and the benediction for the Festival. Cf. above fol. 29 a, p. 192. 

2 I.e. it is not taught in the Schools as a Halakah, but if a Rabbi is asked for his opinion, he follows R. Eliezer's view. 

3 The reference here is to Rabbi, not Rab. 

4 I.e. note it well. 

5 After the destruction of the Seminary of Nehardea in 259, that of Pombedita sprang into prominence and the town received the name of "Capital of the Exile" (Rosh. Hash. 23b). It is situated 22 parasangs North of Sura in Babylon, at the mouth [poma] of the canal Bedita. Neubauer, p. 349. 

6 This is quoted to show how Rahba reported his teacher verbatim. The ordinary word for a colonnade is *** ; but since R. Judah used the word ***, Rahba also used it in quoting him. On this double colonnade see Derenboorg, Essai, p. 51 n., Schurer, ii. i. p. 35. 

7 That we "incline" towards R. Eliezer's opinion or that his view is "probable." 

8 A "precious" form of prayer to be used when the Festival occurs on the termination of the Sabbath. Cf. Singer, pp. 227 f. 

==================================================

1 The reference is to Deut. xxii. 6f. 

2 Implying, not for the bad.

7 By mentioning birds only. 

8 Which mnst be obeyed withont speculating about their motive. J. Lehmann in R.E.J. xxx. pp. 187 ff. suggests that the prayer was originally condemned by the Rabbis because it was Essenic in character. Graetz considers the teaching to be directed against the Gnostics; see his Gnotticitmus und Judentum, pp. 48 f. 

9 To act as Precentor.

2 "The great, mighty and revered." 

3 Deut. x. 17. 

4 See p. 221 n. 4. The words also occur in Nehem. ix. 32; and Ezra and his colleagues were traditionally the founders of the Great Assembly. 

5 See p. 120 n. 5. 

6 The words in brackets are added by M. and the parallel passage in Megillah 25 a. 

7 I.e. God determines whether the person will be tall or short, rich or poor, etc. ; but not whether he will be God-fearing or not. That is left to his own choice. 

8 That God should demand nothing else. 

9 M. : Lo, R. Johanan has said. 

10 This is explained to mean saying the Shema' verse by verse twice. Blau, Das altjudische Zauberwesen, p. 147, suggests that the original reason for the prohibition is to be sought in the practice of repeating a prayer for superstitious or magical purposes. 

==================================================
Page 227
----------
1 In this latter case he may be suspected of dualism. 

2 And thus there is no ground of suspicion ; so why should he be silenced? 

3 I.e. has anyone the right to address God thoughtlessly as one talks with a familiar friend? 

4 That means, we forcibly impress upon him the necessity of Kawwanah. 

5 The word "error" has been substituted for Minut through fear of the Censor. This whole sentence is wanting in the editions of the Mishnah and in J.T.

3 Rashi explains: If he omitted one of the middle benedictions, he can insert it anywhere amongst them when he recalls his omission. Tosafot reject this interpretation and explain : If he omitted one of the middle benedictions and remembers the omission before commencing the concluding benedictions, he goes back to the one omitted and then continues from there, repeating those he had already said. 

4 And should one err in any of them, he goes back to the beginning of 
the fonrth. 

5 M. adds: in the name of Rab. 

6 M.: Rab Huna. 

7 In the Hebrew, the prayer consists of five monosyllables.

2 "We give thanks unto Thee," Singer, p. 51, and "Whose name is all-good," p. 53. 

3 Later authorities forbade kneeling in prayer, because it was characteristic of Christian worship. Prostration has also fallen into disuse; but it was practised in the French Synagogues as late as the 13th cent. Abrahams, p. Ixxvii.

5 Of the benedictions of the Tefillah does the Mishnah refer when it declares that to err therein is a bad omen ?

7 M. : R. Jannai. 

8 The first benediction. 

9 M. : R. Hiyya b. Abba, said in the name of R. Johanan. 

10 Bore' besides meaning "createth" has also the meaning "is strong"; hence the interpretation here is "If the fruit of the lips [i.e. prayer] is vigorous, fluent, then I will heal him."
