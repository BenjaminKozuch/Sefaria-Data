
CHAPTER V 

MISHNAH I 

One must not stand up to say the Tefillah except in a serious frame of mind[1]. The pious men of old[2] used to wait an hour[3] and then say the Tefillah, in order to direct their heart to their Father in Heaven. Even when a king greets him, he must not respond ; and though a serpent be wound round his heel, he must not interrupt. 

GEMARA

Whence is this teaching derived[4]? R. Eleazar said : For the Scriptures state, "She was in bitterness of soul and prayed unto the Lord" (I Sam. i. 10). How is it derived from this verse? Perhaps it was different with Hannah since she was very sore of heart ! But said R. Jose b. R. Hannina : [Derive it] from the following : "But as for me, in the abundance of Thy lovingkindness will I come into Thy house ; I will bow down toward Thy holy Temple in the fear of Thee" (Ps. v. 8). How is it derived from this verse ? Perhaps it was different with David, since he afflicted his soul exceedingly in prayer ! But said R, Joshua b. Levi : [Derive it] from the following : "Worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness" (ibid. xxix. 2) — read not "beauty" [hadrat] but "trembling" [herdat]. How is it derived from this verse ? Perhaps I may indeed tell thee that "in the beauty of holiness" is to be understood literally, as with Rab Judah who used to adorn himself[5] and then pray ! But said Rab Nahman b. Isaac : [Derive it] from the following : "Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling" (ibid. ii. 11). What means "rejoice with trembling"? Rab Adda b. Mattena said in the name of Rabbah[6]: Where there is rejoicing[7] let there be trembling. 

Abbai was sitting in the presence of Rabbah, and noticed that he was very merry. He said to him, "It is written, 'Rejoice with trembling'!" He replied, "I have laid the Tefillin[1]." R. Jeremiah was sitting in the presence of R. Zera, and noticed that he was very merry. He said to him, "It is written, 'In all pain[2] there is profit'!" (Prov. xiv. 23). He replied, "I have laid the Tefillin." 

Mar b. Rabina made a wedding-feast for his son, and noticed that the Rabbis were very merry. He seized a costly goblet[3] worth four hundred Zuz and broke it before them, and they became more serious. Rab Ashe made a wedding-feast for his son, [[fol. 31a.]] and noticed that the Rabbis were very merry. He seized a goblet of white crystal and broke it before them, and they became more serious. The Rabbis said to Rab Hamnuna the Small[4] at the wedding-feast of Mar b. Rabina, "Let the master sing for us." He replied to them, "Woe to us for we are destined to die! Woe to us for we are destined to die!" They said to him, "What can we answer after thee ?" He said to them, "Where is the Torah and where the religious precept which will protect us[5]?" 

R. Johanan said in the name of R. Simeon b. Johai : It is forbidden that a man's mouth be filled with laughter in this world ; because it is written, "Then will our mouth be filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing" (Ps. cxxvi. 2). When ? At the time when "They will say among the nations. The Lord hath done great things with these" (ibid.). It was said of R. Simeon b. Lakish that never again was his mouth full of laughter in this world after hearing this teaching from his master R. Johanan[6]. 

Our Rabbis have taught : One must not stand up to say the Tefillah immediately after being engaged in a lawsuit or the discussion of a Halakah[7] ; but he may do so after the discussion of a Halakah which has been decided. What is meant by a Halakah which has been decided ? Abbai said : Like that of R. Zera who stated : The daughters of Israel are very strict with themselves ; for if they see even a drop of menstrual flow as small as a mustard seed, they wait seven clear days after it. Raba said : Like that of Rab Hosha'ya who stated : A man should act cunningly with his produce, and store it together with the chaff, so that his cattle may eat of it and it become exempt from the tithe[1]. If thou wilt I can say like that of Rab Huna who stated in the name of R. Ze'ira[2] : He who draws blood from an animal destined for a sacritice is forbidden to make use of it, and [should he use it] he must bring a transgression-offering[3]. The Rabbis act according to our Miahnah[4] ; Rab Ashe acted according to the Baraita[5]. 

Our Rabbis have taught : One must not stand up to say the Tefillah from the midst of sorrow, idleness, jocularity, [frivolous] conversation, levity, or idle chatter, but only from the midst of the joy of a religious duty. Similarly a man should not take leave of another from the midst of [frivolous] conversation, jocularity, levity, or idle chatter ; but from the midst of a discussion of Halakah. For so we find that the former prophets used to conclude their addresses with words of praise and consolation. So also Mari the son of[6] Rab Huna the son of R. Jeremiah b. Abba taught : A man should not take leave of another except from the midst of a discussion of Halakah, so that he may remember him thereby. Thus, Rab Kahana[7] accompanied Rab Shimi b. Ashe from Pom-Nahara[8] to Be-Sinyata[9] in Babylon. When he arrived there, he said to him, "Is it true what people say that these Babylonian palms are from the time of Adam till now ?" He answered, "Thou hast reminded me of something which R. Jose b. R. Hannina said, viz. : What means that which is written, 'Through a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelt' (Jer. ii. 6) ? Since no man passed through it, how could anyone dwell there ! But it intends to tell us that every land concerning which Adam decreed that it should be inhabited has become inhabited, and every land concerning which Adam did not so decree has not been inhabited[1]." Rab Mordecai accompanied Rab Ashe[2] from Hagronya[3] to Be-Kipe[4] ; another version : to Be-Dura[5]. 

Our Rabbis have taught : He who prays must direct his heart to Heaven. Abba Saul said: A [Biblical] indication for this matter is : "Thou wilt direct their heart, Thou wilt cause Thine ear to attend" (Ps. x. 17). 

There is a teaching: R. Judah said: It was the practice of R. 'Akiba, when he said the Tefillah with the Congregation, to shorten [the time in which he said it] and step back[6], so as to avoid troubling the Congregation[7]; but when he said the Tefillah alone, a man might leave him in one corner and find him in another corner. And why so? Because of his bowings and genuflections. 

R. Hiyya b. Abba said : A man should always pray in a room which has windows ; as it is said, "Now his windows were open in his upper chamber towards Jerusalem" (Dan. vi. 11). It is possible to imagine that a man can pray all the day long ; but it has already been clearly stated by Daniel, "And he kneeled upon his knees three times a day and prayed, and gave thanks before his God " (ibid.). It is possible to imagine that only when he was taken into captivity, he commenced to pray thus ; but it has been said, "As he did aforetime" (ibid.). It is possible to imagine that one can pray in any direction he wishes; therefore there is a teaching to state, "Towards Jerusalem" (ibid.). It is possible to imagine that a man can include all his prayers in one act of devotion ; but it has already been clearly stated by David, "Evening and morning and at noonday" (Ps. Iv. 18). It is possible to imagine that one should utter his prayers aloud ; but it has already been clearly stated by Hannah, viz. "Her voice could not be heard" (I Sam. i. 13). It is possible to imagine that a man could pray for his own needs and afterwards say the statutory prayers ; but it has already been clearly stated by Solomon, viz. "To hearken unto the cry and to the prayer" (I Kings viii. 28) — "cry" means statutory prayer, and "prayer" means personal supplication. 

One may not offer anything [of personal supplication] after "True and firm[1]": but after the Tefillah, he can say something even like the order of confession for the Day of Atonement[2], It has been likewise reported : R. Hiyya b. Ashe declared in the name of Rab : Although it has been said that one may pray for his personal needs in the benediction "Who hearkenest unto prayer[3]," if he desires to add after the Tefillah even something like the order of [confession for] the Day of Atonement, he may do so. 

Rab Hamnuna said : How many weighty Halakot there are to be learnt from the passage relating to Hannah ! "Now Hannah, she spake in her heart" (I Sam. i. 13) — hence it is deduced that one who prays must direct his heart. "Only her lips moved" — hence, one who prays must pronounce [the words] with his lips. "But her voice was not heard" — hence, it is forbidden to raise the voice when praying. "Therefore Eli thought she had been drunken" — hence, it is forbidden to pray when intoxicated. "And Eli said to her. How long wilt thou be drunken?" (ibid. v. 14) — [[fol. 31 b.]] R. Eleazar said: Hence, if one sees in his neighbour anything that is unseemly, he must rebuke him. "And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord" (ibid. v. 15) — 'Ulla (another version: R. Jose b. R. Hannina) declared : She said to Eli, "Thou art not 'a lord' in this affair, nor does the Holy Spirit rest upon thee, seeing thou hast suspected me of this thing." Some declare that she spoke to him thus : "Thou art not a lord ; neither the Shekinah nor the Holy Spirit is with thee, for thou hast judged me in the scale of guilt and not in the scale of merit[4]. Dost thou not know 'I am a woman of sorrowful spirit'?" "I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink" — R. Eleazar said : Hence it is deduced that one who is wrongly suspected must clear himself. "Count not thy handmaid for a wicked woman" (I Sam. i. 16) — R. Eleazar said : Hence it is inferred that if a drunken peraon prays, it is as though he practised idolatry; for it is written here "a wicked woman[1]," and elsewhere it is written, "Certain base fellows[2] are gone out from the midst of thee" (Deut. xiii. 14) — as the reference in this latter passage is to idolatry, so also in the other passage idolatry is intended. "Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace" (I Sam. i. 17) — R. Eleazar said : Hence, if one wrongly suspected another, he must conciliate him ; nay more, he must bless him ; as it is said, "And the God of Israel grant thy petition" (ibid.). 

"And she vowed a vow and said, O Lord of hosts" (ibid. v. 11) — R. Eleazar said : From the day that the Holy One, blessed be He, created His universe, there was nobody who called Him "[Lord of] hosts" until Hannah came and gave Him that designation. Hannah said before the Holy One, blessed be He, "Lord of the universe ! From all the multitudes of hosts which Thou hast created in Thy universe, is it hard in Thine eyes to grant me even one son?" A parable : To what is the matter like ? To a human king who made a feast for his servants. A poor man came and stood at the entrance and said to them, "Give me a morsel of bread" ; but they took no notice of him. He pushed his way through and entered the presence of the king, exclaiming, "My lord, the king ! From all the feast which thou hast made, is it hard in thine eyes to spare me a morsel of bread ?" 

"If thou wilt indeed look[3]" (ibid.) — R. Eleazar said: Thus spake Hannah before the Holy One, blessed be He, "Lord of the universe ! If Thou wilt look, well and good ; but if Thou wilt not look, I will go and seclude myself [with another man][4] before Elkanah my husband ; and having done so, they will administer to me the waters of the woman suspected of adultery, and Thou wilt surely not make Thy Torah a fraud ; for it is said, 'Then she shall be cleared, and shall conceive seed'" (Num. v. 28). This is quite right for him who maintains that if [the woman wrongly suspected] was barren, then she will conceive ; but according to him who maintains [that as the result of her proved innocence], if she usually gave birth in pain she now gives birth with ease, [if she usually brought forth] daughters she now brings forth sons[1], [if she usually brought forth] dark[2] children she now brings forth fair children, [if she usually brought forth] short children she now brings forth tall children — what is there to say[3]? For there is a teaching : "Then she shall be cleared, and shall conceive seed" — this teaches that if she had been barren she now conceives; these are the words of R. Ishmael. R. 'Akiba said to him : In that case, all barren women will go and lay themselves under suspicion, and she who has not done wrong [after receiving the waters] will conceive ! Nay, it teaches, that if she usually gave birth in pain, she now gives birth with ease ; that she will have tall children instead of short, fair instead of dark, two instead of one. But how is "If Thou wilt indeed look" to be explained[4]? The Torah speaks according to the language of the sons of man[5]. 

"[If Thou wilt indeed look] on the affliction of Thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget Thy handmaid, but wilt give unto Thy handmaid" (I Sam. i. 11). R. Jose b. R. Hannina said : Why is "Thy handmaid" repeated thrice ? Hannah spake before the Holy One, blessed be He, "Lord of the universe ! Three breaches [bidke] through which death comes[6] hast Thou created in a woman ; (another version : Three causes [dibke] of death), viz, : neglect of the laws concerning menstruation, Hallah and kindling the Sabbath-lights[7]. Have I transgressed any of them?" 

"But wilt give Thy handmaid seed of men" (ibid.). What means "seed of men"? Rab said : A man among men[8]. Samuel said : Seed which will anoint two men ; and who are they ? Saul and David. R. Johanan said : Seed equal to two men ; and who are they? Moses and Aaron ; as it is said, "Moses and Aaron among His priests, and Samuel among them that call upon His name" (Ps. xcix. 6). The Rabbis say : "Seed of men" means seed which will be swallowed up among men[9]. When Rab Dimai came [from Palestine] he explained [the words of the Rabbis to mean] : neither tall nor dwarfish nor short, neither dark[1] nor ruddy nor pale, neither too wise nor too foolish. 

"I am the woman that stood by thee here" (I Sam. i. 26). R. Joshua b. Levi said : Hence it is deduced that it is forbidden to sit within four cubits of [one engaged in] prayer[2]. 

"For this child I prayed" (ibid. v. 27). R. Eleazar said : Samuel was one who decided a Halakah in the presence of his master[3] ; as it is said, "And when the bullock was slain, the child was brought to Eli" (ibid. v. 25). Because "the bullock was slain," therefore "the child was brought to Eli[4]"! Nay; but Eli said to them, "Call a priest that he may come and slay [the bullock]." Samuel saw them going for a priest to slay it? so he said to them, "Why go searching for a priest to slay it? If the act of slaying is performed by a non-priest it is valid." They brought him before Eli, who asked him, "Whence hast thou this teaching?" He replied, "Is it written, 'The priest shall slay'? It is written, 'The priests shall present the blood' (Lev. i, 5). From the receiving of the blood onwards is the function of the priesthood ; hence, the act of slaying is valid if performed by a non-priest." Eli said to him, "An excellent teaching hast thou expounded ; still thou art one who decided a Halakah in the presence of thy master[5], and whoever does that incurs the penalty of death." Then Hannah came and cried before him, "I am the woman that stood by thee here." He said to her, "Leave me alone that I may punish him, and I will pray that [a son] greater than he be granted thee." She answered him, "For this child I prayed." 

"Now Hannah she spake in[6] her heart" (I Sam. i. 13) — Eleazar said in the name of R. Jose b. Zimra : [She spoke] about the concerns of her heart. She spake before Him, "Lord of the universe ! In all that Thou hast created in a woman Thou hast created nothing in vain — eyes to see, ears to hear, a nose to smell, a mouth to speak, hands wherewith to do work, feet to walk with, breasts to suckle with. But these breasts which Thou hast placed upon my heart, why have I not occasion to suckle with them? Give me a son, that I may suckle with them." 

R. Eleazar also said in the name of R. Jose b. Zimra : Whoever imposes a fast upon hiinself on the Sabbath[1], the decree of seventy years is annulled for him[2] ; but for all that the penalty for [denying himself] the delight of the Sabbath will be exacted from him. How can he make amends? Rab Nahman b. Isaac said : Let him observe a fast [in expiation] of his fast. 

R. Eleazar also said : Hannah spoke rebelliously to the Most High; as it is said, "She prayed against[3] the Lord" (I Sam. i. 10), which teaches that she spoke rebelliously to the Most High. R. Eletizar also said : Elijah spoke rebelliously to the Most High ; as it is said, "For Thou didst turn their heart backward" (I Kings xviii. 37). R. Samuel b. Rab Isaac said : Whence [do we find] that the Holy One, blessed be He, replied and admitted [the plea of] Elijah ? For it is written, "[In that day, saith the Lord, will I assemble...] her that I have afflicted" (Micah iv. 6). 

Rab Hamma b. R. Hannina said : Were it not for the following three verses, the feet of the enemies of Israel would give way under them[4]; first, that which is written, "Her that I have afflicted" (ibid.); second, that which is written, "Behold as the clay in the potter's hand, so are ye in My hand, O house of Israel" (Jer. xviii. 6) ; third, that which is written, "I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh" (Ezek. xxxvi. 26). Rab Pappa said : [It may also be learnt] from this passage: "And I will put My spirit within you, and cause you to walk in My statutes" (ibid. v. 27). 

R. Eleazar also said : Moses spoke rebelliously to the Most High; as it is said, "And Moses prayed unto the Lord" (Num. xi. 2) — read not "unto [el] the Lord" but "against ['al] the Lord"; for so the school of R. Eliezer b. Jacob interchange the letters aleph and 'ayin. The school of R. Jannai say : [It may be learnt] from the passage "And Di-Zahab" (Deut. i. 1). What means "And Di-Zahab"? The school of R. Jannai declare : Thus spake Moses before the Holy One, blessed be He, "Lord of the universe ! It was because of the silver and gold [zahab] which Thou didst bounteously give to Israel until they cried, 'It is sufficient' [dai], that they were induced to make the calf." The school of R. Jannai said, "A lion growls not in a den full of straw but in a den full of meat[1]." R. Osha'ya said : A parable: [It may be likened] to a man who had a lean cow but of large build. He fed it on horse-beans, and it kicked him. He said to it, "What caused thee to kick me but the horse-beans on which I fed thee!" R. Hiyya b. Abba said in the name of R. Johanan : A parable : [It may be likened] to a man who had a son. He washed him, anointed him, gave him to eat and drink, tied a purse about his neck, and set him at the entrance of a brothel. How can that son help sinning ? Rab Aha b. Rab Huna said in the name of Rab Sheshet : That is what people say : "He whose stomach is full increaseth deeds of evil" ; as it is said, "When they were fed, they became full, they were filled, and their heart was exalted ; therefore have they forgotten Me" (Hosea xiii. 6). Rab Nahman[2] said : [It may be learnt] from this passage : "Then thy heart be lifted up, and thou forget the Lord thy God" (Deut. viii. 14) ; and the Rabbis said from the following: "And they shall have eaten their fill, and waxen fat, and turned unto other gods " (ibid. xxxi. 20) ; or if thou wilt, from the following : "But Jeshurun waxed fat and kicked " (ibid, xxxii. 15). R. Samuel b. Nahmani said in the name of R. Jonathan : Whence is it that the Holy One, blessed be He, afterwards admitted [the plea of] Moses ? As it is said, "I multiplied unto her silver and gold, which they used for Baal" (Hosea ii. 10). 

"And the Lord spake unto Moses, Go, get thee down" (Exod. xxxii. 7). What means "Go, get thee down" ? R, Eleazar said : The Holy One, blessed be He, spake to Moses, "Moses, get thee down from thy greatness. Have I given thee greatness but for the sake of Israel? And now that Israel has sinned, what art thou to Me?" Immediately the strength of Moses was weakened, and he had not the power to speak[1]. But when He said, "Let Me alone, that I may destroy them" (Deut. ix. 14), Moses said [to himself], "This matter depends upon me." He at once stood up and strengthened himself with prayer and besought mercy [for Israel]. A parable : [It may be likened] to a king who was enraged against his son, and he struck him a violent blow. His friend was sitting in his presence but was afraid to say anything to him. The king exclaimed, "Were it not that my friend were sitting in my presence, I would kill thee." [The friend] said [to himself], "This matter depends upon me." He at once stood up and rescued him. 

"Now therefore let Me alone, that My wrath may wax hot against them and that I may consume them ; and I will make of thee a great nation" etc. (Exod. xxxii. 10). R. Abbahu[2] said : Were it not explicitly written, it would be impossible to say it ; for this teaches that Moses caught hold of the Holy One, blessed be He, like a man who takes hold of his neighbour by his garment, and said before Him, "Lord of the universe ! I will not let Thee alone until Thou forgivest and pardonest them." 

"I will make of thee a great nation" etc. R. Eleazar said : Moses spake before the Holy One, blessed be He, "Lord of the universe ! If a stool with three legs[3] cannot stand before Thee in the time of Thy wrath, how much less a stool with but one leg[4] ! Nay more, I have reason to feel abashed before my ancestors. For now will they say, 'Behold the leader whom He appointed over them ! He sought greatness for himself and begged not mercy on their behalf!" 

"And Moses besought [wayyehal] the Lord his God" (ibid. v. 11). R. Eleazar said : This teaches that Moses stood in prayer before the Holy One, blessed be He, until he wore Him out [hehelehu][5]. Raba said : [Moses besought Him] until He annulled His vow for him ; for it is written here wayyehal "and he besought," and elsewhere it is written, "he shall not break [yahel] his word" (Num. XXX. 3) ; and a teacher has said : [He who makes a vow] cannot break it himself, but others can break it on his behalf[6]. 

Samuel[1] said: It teaches that Moses jeopardised himself unto death on their behalf[2] ; as it is said, "And if not, blot me, I pray Thee, out of Thy book which Thou hast written" (Exod. xxxii. 32). Raba said in the name of Rab Isaac : It teaches that he called into play [hal] the attribute of mercy upon them[3]. The Rabbis say : It teaches that Moses spake before the Holy One, blessed be He, "Lord of the universe ! It would be profanation [hullin] for Thee to do such a thing." "And Moses besought the Lord." There is a teaching : R. Eliezer the Elder[4] said : This teaches that Moses stood in prayer before the Holy One, blessed be He, until ahilu seized him. What means ahilu? R. Eleazar said : The fire of the bones. What means "fire of the bones"? Abbai said: Eshshata degarme[5]. 

"Remember Abraham, Isaac and Israel, Thy servants, to whom Thou didst swear by Thine own self" (ibid. v. 13). What means "By Thine own self" ? R. Eleazar said : Moses spake before the Holy One, blessed be He, "Lord of the universe ! If Thou hadst sworn to them by heaven and earth, I might have said that as heaven and earth will be annulled, so will Thine oath be annulled ; but now that Thou hast sworn to them by Thy great name, as Thy great name lives and endures for all eternity, so must Thine oath endure for all eternity." 

"And Thou saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed" (ibid.). The phrase "that I have spoken of" should rather be "that Thou hast spoken of"[6] ! R. Eleazar said : Up to here we have the words of the disciple, but from here onwards the words of the Master[7]. R. Samuel b. Nahmani said : All of them are the words of the disciple ; but thus spake Moses before the Holy One, blessed be He, "Lord of the universe ! The word which Thou saidst unto me, 'Go, speak to Israel,' I went and spoke in Thy name. And now what can I say to them?" 

"Because the Lord was not able [yekolet]" (Num. xiv. 16). It should have been yakol[1]! R. Eleazar said : Moses spake before the Holy One, blessed be He, "Lord of the universe ! Now will the nations of the world say, 'His strength has become weak like that of a woman and He is unable to deliver [His people]'!" The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, "But have they not already seen the miracles and mighty acts which I wrought for Israel by the Red Sea?" He said before Him, "Lord of the universe ! They will still be able to say, 'Against one king[2] He was able to stand, but not against thirty-one[3]'!" R. Johanan said : Whence is it that the Holy One, blessed be He, afterwards yielded to Moses? As it is said, "And the Lord said, I have forgiven according to thy word" (ibid. v. 20). The school of R. Ishmael taught : "According to thy word" — the nations of the world will say thus, "Happy the disciple to whom his Master yielded." "But in very deed, as I live" (ibid. v. 21) — Raba said in the name of Rab Isaac : This teaches that the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, "Moses, thou hast made Me to survive [in the estimation of the peoples] with thy word." 

R. Simlai expounded : A man should always recount the praise of the Holy One, blessed be He, and thereafter pray [for his needs]. Whence have we this? From Moses; for it is written, "And I besought the Lord at that time, saying" (Deut. iii. 23). Then it is written, "O Lord God, Thou hast begun to show Thy servant Thy greatness, and Thy strong hand ; for what god is there in heaven or on earth, that can do according to Thy works, and according to Thy mighty acts ?" (ibid. v. 24). And after that it is written, "Let me go over, I pray Thee, and see the good land" etc. (ibid. v. 25). 

(Mnemonic: Deeds, Charity, Offering, Priest, Fast, Lock, Iron[4].) 

[[fol. 32 b.]] R. Eleazar said : Greater is prayer than good deeds ; for thou hast no one greater in good deeds than Moses, our teacher, nevertheless he was only answered through prayer ; as it is said, "Speak no more unto Me of this matter" (ibid. v. 26), which is followed by, "Get thee up into the top of Pisgah" (ibid. v. 27)[5]. 

R. Eleazar also said : Greater is fasting than charity. What is the reason ? The former [demands the sacrifice] of the person, the latter of money. 

R. Eleazar also said : Greater is prayer than sacrifices ; as it is said, "To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto Me?" (Is. i. 11), and it is written, "And when ye spread forth your hands" (ibid. v. 15)[1]. R. Johanan said : A Kohen who has committed murder must not lift up his hands[2]; as it is said, "Your hands are full of blood" (ibid.). 

R. Eleazar also said : From the day the Temple was destroyed, the gates of prayer were locked ; as it is said, "Yea, when I cry and call for help, He shutteth out my prayer" (Lam. iii. 8). But although the gates of prayer are locked, the gates of tears remain unlocked ; as it is said, "Hear my prayer, O Lord, and give ear unto my cry ; keep not silence at my tears" (Ps. xxxix. 13). Raba never proclaimed a fast on a cloudy day, because it is said, "Thou hast covered Thyself with a cloud, so that no prayer can pass through" (Lam. iii. 44). 

R. Eleazar also said : From the day the Temple was destroyed, a wall of iron divides between Israel and their Father in Heaven ; as it is said, "And take thou unto thee an iron griddle, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city" (Ezek. iv. 3). 

R. Hannin said in the name of R. Hannina : Whoever prolongs his prayer, his prayer will not return empty. Whence have we this ? From Moses our teacher ; as it is said, "And I prayed unto the Lord" (Deut. ix. 26), and it is afterwards written, "[Now I stayed in the mount... forty days and forty nights ;] and the Lord hearkened unto me that time also" (ibid. x. 10). But it is not so ! For R. Hiyya b. Abba has said in the name of R. Johanan : Whoever prolongs his prayer and calculates on it[3] will eventually come to pain of heart ; as it is said, "Hope[4] deferred maketh the heart sick" (Prov. xiii. 12). What is his remedy? Let him occupy himself with Torah; as it is said, "But desire fulfilled is a tree of life" (ibid.), and "tree of life" is nothing else than Torah, as it is said, "It is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon it" (Prov. iii. 18)! There is no contradiction; the latter teaching refers to one who prolongs his prayer and calculates on it, the former to one who prolongs his prayer without calculating on it. 

R. Hamma b. Hannina said : If a man sees that he prays and is not answered he should repeat his prayer ; as it is said, "Wait for the Lord ; be strong and let thy heart take courage ; yea, wait thou for the Lord" (Ps. xxvii. 14). 

Our Rabbis have taught: Four things require effort, viz. : Torah, good deeds, prayer and worldly occupation. Whence is it that Torah and good deeds [require effort] ? As it is said, "Only be strong and very courageous to observe to do according to all the law" (Josh. i. 7) — "be strong" in Torah, and "very courageous" in good deeds. Whence is it that prayer [requires effort] ? As it is said, "Wait for the Lord ; he strong, and let thy heart take courage; yea, wait thou for the Lord" (Ps. I.c.). Whence is it that worldly occupation [requires effort]? As it is said, "Be of good courage, and let us prove strong for our people" etc. (II Sam. X. 12). 

"But Zion said. The Lord hath forsaken me, and the Lord hath forgotten me" (Is. xlix. 14). But a woman forsaken is the same as a woman forgotten ! R. Simeon b. Lakish said : The community of Israel spake before the Holy One, blessed be He, "Lord of the universe ! Should a man marry a woman after his first wife, he remembers the deeds of the first ; but Thou hast forsaken me and forgotten me!" The Holy One, blessed be He, replied, "My daughter, twelve constellations have I created in the firmament[1], and for each constellation I have created thirty[2] hosts, and for each host I have created thirty legions, and for each legion I have created thirty files, and for each file I have created thirty cohorts, and for each cohort I have created thirty camps[3], and in each camp I have suspended three hundred and sixty-five thousand myriads of stars, in accordance with the days of the solar year, and all of them have I only created for thy sake ; and yet thou sayest, 'Thou hast forsaken me, Thou hast forgotten me'!" 

"Can a woman forget her sucking child ['ulah]?" (Is. xlix. 15). The Holy One, blessed be He, said, "Can I forget the burnt-offerings ['olot] of rams and the firstborn of animals which Thou didst offer to Me in the wilderness?" [The community of Israel] spake before Him, "Lord of the universe ! Since there is no forgetfulness before the throne of Thy glory, perhaps Thou wilt not forget against me the incident of the Golden Calf!" He replied, "Yea, 'these' will be forgotten" (ibid.)[1]. Israel spake before Him, "Lord of the universe! Since there is forgetfulness before the throne of Thy glory, perhaps Thou wilt forget for me the incident at Sinai!" He replied, "Yet 'the I' will I not forget thee" (ibid.)[2]. That is the meaning of R. Eleazar's statement in the name of R. Osha'ya : What is that which is written, "Yea, 'these' will be forgotten"? That refers to the incident of the Golden Calf; "Yet 'the I' will I not forget thee"? That refers to the incident at Sinai. 

The pious men of old used to wait an hour. 

Whence is this? R. Joshua b. Levi said : The Scriptures state, "Happy are they that dwell in Thy house" (Ps. Ixxxiv, 5). R. Joshua b. Levi also said : He who prays should wait an hour after his prayer[3] ; as it is said, "Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto Thy name, the upright shall dwell in Thy presence" (ibid. cxl. 14)[4]. There is a teaching to the same effect : He who prays should wait an hour before and an hour after his prayer. Whence is it [that he should wait an hour] before his prayer? As it is said, "Happy are they that dwell in Thy house." Whence is it [that he should wait an hour] after his prayer? As it is said, "Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto Thy name; the upright shall dwell in Thy presence." 

Our Rabbis have taught : The pious men of old used to wait an hour, pray for an hour, and again wait an hour. Since they spent nine hours in the day in connection with prayer[5], how was their Torah kept up, and how was their work done ? But since they were pious, their Torah was preserved[1] and their work was blessed[2]. 

Even when a king greets him, he must not respond. 

Rab Joseph said : This teaching applies only to the Israelite kings ; but for the kings of other peoples he must stop. Against this is quoted : He who prays [the Tefillah] and sees a highway robber[3] or waggon coming towards him should not interrupt but shorten it and step back ! There is no contradiction ; for this means where it is possible to shorten, he should shorten, but if not, he should interrupt. 

Our Rabbis have taught : It happened that a pious man was saying the Tefillah by the roadside. A nobleman passed and greeted him ; but he did not respond. The nobleman waited until he had concluded his prayer ; and after he had concluded it, he said to him, "Good for nothing[4]! Is it not written in your Torah, 'Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently' (Deut iv. 9) and 'Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves' (ibid. V. 15)? When I greeted thee, why didst thou not return my salutation? If I had cut off thy head with a sword, who would have demanded thy blood at my hand?" He replied, "Wait until I shall have conciliated thee with words." And he continued, "If thou hadst been standing before a human king, [[fol. 33 a.]] and thy friend had greeted thee, wouldst thou have responded to him?" "No," he replied. "And if thou hadst responded to him, what would they have done to thee?" He answered, "They would have cut off my head with the sword." He said to him, "May we not use the a fortiori argument : If thou standing before a human king, who is here to-day and to-morrow in the grave, actest thus, how much more so I who was standing before the supreme King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He, Who lives and endures for all eternity?" The nobleman was at once conciliated, and the pious man departed for his house in peace. And though a serpent is wound round his heel, he must not interrupt. 

Rab Sheshet said : This teaching applies only to a serpent, but if it be a scorpion he may interrupt[1]. Against this is quoted : If a man fell into a den of lions, we cannot testify concerning him that he is dead[2] ; but if he fell into a pit of serpents or scorpions, we can so testify[3] ! It is different in this case, because through the pressure[4] they will injure him. R. Isaac[5] said: If he saw oxen[6], he may interrupt ; for Rab Osha'ya taught : One should remove himself fifty cubits from an ox which has never injured anybody and as far as he can see it from an ox whose owner has been warned of its tendency to gore. It has been taught in the name of R. Meir : Even when the ox has its head in the [fodder-] basket, go up to the roof, and remove the ladder from under thee[7]. Samuel said: This applies only to a black ox in the days of Nisan, because Satan then dances between its horns[8]. 

Our Rabbis have taught : It happened in a certain place that there was a lizard which injured people. They came and informed R. Hannina b. Dosa[9]. He said to them, "Show me its hole." They pointed it out to him, and he placed his heel over the mouth of the hole. The lizard came out and bit him, and it died[10]. He put it on his shoulder and brought it to the House of Study. He said to them, "See, my sons, it is not the lizard that kills but sin that kills." At that time the saying originated : "Woe to the man who meets a lizard ; but woe to the lizard which R. Hannina b. Dosa meets." 

MISHNAH II 

We refer to rain in the benediction of "the Revival of the Dead[1]" and the request [for rain] in the benediction of "the Years[2]," and the "Division" in "Thou favourest man with knowledge[3]." R. 'Akiba says : One should say the last mentioned as a fourth benediction by itself. R. Eliezer says : [It is to be included] in the "Thanksgiving[4]." 

GEMARA 

We refer to rain in the benediction of "the Revival of the Dead." 

Why ? Rab Joseph said : Because it is equal to the revival of the dead[5], therefore they fixed it in the benediction of "the Revival of the Dead." 

And the request [for rain] in the benediction of "the Years." Why ? Rab Joseph said : Because it is sustenance, therefore they fixed it in the benediction relating to sustenance. 

And the "Division" in "Thou favourest man with knowledge." 

Why? Rab Joseph said : Because it is wisdom[6], they fixed it in the benediction relating to wisdom. The Rabbis say : Because it refers to the non-holy, therefore they fixed it in the [first] benediction [of the Tefillah] for the week-day. 

R. Ammi said : Great is knowledge, which is placed at the beginning of the benediction said in the week-day [Tefillah]. R. Ammi also said[7] : Great is knowledge which is placed between two references to the Divine Name[8] ; as it is said, "For a God of knowledge is the Lord" (I Sam. ii. 3). It is forbidden to have mercy upon one who does not possess knowledge ; as it is said, "For it is a people of no understanding, therefore He that made them will not have compassion upon them" (Is. xxvii. 11)[9]. 

R. Eleazar said : Great is the Sanctuary which is placed between two references to the Divine Name; as it is said, "...Thou hast made, O Lord, the sanctuary, O Lord..." (Exod. xv. 17). R. Eleazar also said : Every one who possesses knowledge is as though the Sanctuary was built in his days ; for "knowledge" is placed between two references to the Divine Name and "Sanctuary" is similarly placed. Rab Aha Karhinaah[1] retorted : In that case, great is vengeance which is placed between two references to the Divine Name; as it is said, "A God of vengeance, the Lord" (Ps. xciv. 1)[2]! He replied : Quite so, in certain circumstances it is great ; and that is what 'Ulla said : Why is "vengeance" mentioned twice in the verse[3]? One for good, the other for evil — for good, as it is written, "He shone forth from Mount Paran" (Deut. xxxiii. 2) ; for evil, as it is written, "O Lord, Thou God, to Whom vengeance belongeth, Thou God, to Whom vengeance belongeth, shine forth" (Ps. xciv. 1). 

R. 'Akiba says : One should say the last-mentioned as a fourth benediction by itself. 

Rab Shamman b. Abba said to R. Johanan, "It is a fact that the men of the Great Assembly[4] instituted for Israel benedictions and prayers, Sanctifications and Divisions ; let us see where it was arranged [for the Habdalah to be said]." He replied to him, "At first they fixed it in the Tefillah ; when the people became prosperous[5], they arranged for it to be said over the cup of wine[6]; when the people became poor, they again fixed it in the Tefillah ; and they said : He who pronounces the 'Division' in the Tefillah must do it again over the cup of wine." It has been similarly reported : R. Hiyya. b. Abba said in the name of R. Johanan : The men of the Great Assembly instituted for Israel benedictions and prayers, Sanctifications and Divisions. At first they fixed [the Habdalah] in the Tefillah; when the people became prosperous, they arranged for it to be said over the cup of wine ; when they again became poor, they fixed it in the Tefillah ; and they said : He who pronounces the "Division" in the Tefillah must do it again over the cup of wine. It has been likewise reported : Rabbah and Rab Joseph both declare : He who pronounces the "Division" in the Tefillah must do it again over the cup of wine.
 
Raba said : We quote against this teaching : If one erred and omitted the reference to rain in the benediction of "the Revival of the Dead" or the request [for rain] in the benediction of "the Years," we make him repeat it ; but [if he omitted] the "Division" in "Thou favourest man with knowledge" we do not make him repeat it, because he is able to say it over the cup of wine ! Do not say "because he is able to say it over the cup of wine" but "because he says it over the cup of wine." It has been similarly reported : R. Benjamin b. Jephet said : R. Assi[1] asked R. Johanan in Zidon (another version : R. Simeon b. Jacob of Tyre asked R. Johanan), "But I have heard that one who says the 'Division' in the Tefillah must say it again over the cup of wine ; or is it not so?" He replied, "Yes, he must say the Habdalah over the cup of wine." 

The question was raised : How is it with one who says the Habdalah over the cup of wine, does he say it in the Tefillah? Rab Nahman b. Isaac replied : We draw an a fortiori conclusion from the Tefillah : If of the Tefillah where [the Habdalah] was originally instituted they say : He who pronounced the "Division" in the Tefillah must do so again over the cup of wine, how much more so must one who says the Habdalah over the cup of wine, where it was not originally instituted, [say it in the Tefillah] ! 

R. Aha[2] the Tall taught in the presence of Rab Huna[3] : He who pronounces the "Division" in the Tefillah is more praiseworthy than he who says it over the cup of wine ; but if he says it in both, may blessings alight upon his head. But this is self-contradictory ! Thou declarest, "He who pronounces the 'Division' in the Tefillah is more praiseworthy than he who says it over the cup of wine"; hence it is sufficient to say it in the Tefillah alone ! And then he teaches, "But if he says it in both, may blessings alight upon his head"; but since he has fulfilled his obligation with the former, he is exempt and [the latter] will be a superfluous benediction, and Rab has declared (another version : R. Simeon b. Lakish ; or R. Johanan and R. Simeon b. Lakish both declare) : Whoever utters a superfluous benediction commits a transgression because of [the injunction], "Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain" (Exod. xx. 7) ! Understand him therefore to mean : If he pronounced the "Division" in the Tefillah and not over the cup of wine, may blessings alight upon his head. 

Rab Hisda[1] asked Rab Sheshet : If a man erred [and omitted the Habdalah] in both, how is it ? He replied : If he erred in both, he must start again. Rabina asked Raba : What is the Halakah [if one pronounced the "Division" in the Tefillah, must he say it over the cup of wine] ? He replied : It is like the Sanctification ; although one sanctifies [the Sabbath] in the Tefillah, he must do so over the cup of wine; so also with the Habdalah, although he said it in the Tefillah, he must do so over the cup of wine. 

R. Eliezer said : [It is to he included] in the "Thanksgiving" 

R. Zera was riding on an ass, and R. Hiyya b. Abin was following him. He said to him, "Is it really so as thou didst state in the name of R. Johanan : The Halakah is in agreement with R. Eliezer on a Festival which occurs on the conclusion of the Sabbath ?" He replied, "Yes." "The Halakah being so, is it to be inferred that there are some who differ from him[2]? Are there not, indeed, some who differ?" "The Rabbis differ from him." "On which point do the Rabbis differ?" "On the other days of the year[3]." "Do they differ on the question of a Festival which occurs at the conclusion of the Sabbath? Behold R. 'Akiba differs[4]!" "Do we, then, act in accordance with R. 'Akiba the whole year, that we should now agree and act in accord with his view? Why do we not act in agreement with R. 'Akiba the whole year? Because eighteen benedictions were instituted, not nineteen; and so here also, seven benedictions were instituted, not eight[1]." [R. Zera] said to him: It has not been reported that the Halakah [is in accord with R. Eliezer], but it has been reported that we incline [towards his view][2]. For it has been reported : Rab Isaac b. Abdemi said in the name of our teacher[3] : The Halakah [is in accord with R. Eliezer] ; but some say : We incline [towards his view]. R. Johanan said : [The Rabbis] acknowledge [that the Halakah is in agreement with him]. R. Hiyya b. Abba said : [R. Eliezer's opinion] is probable. R. Zera said : Take the statement of R. Hiyya. b. Abba in thine hand[4], because he is most careful to report a teaching exactly as it issued from the mouth of his teacher ; like Rahba of Pombedita[5]. For Rahba said in the name of R. Judah : The Templemount was a double colonnade, and it was a colonnade within a colonnade[6]. 

Rab Joseph said : I know neither the one nor the other[7] ; but from Rab and Samuel I know that they instituted a "pearl"[8] for us in Babylon : "Thou, O Lord our God, hast made known unto us the judgments of Thy righteousness ; Thou hast taught us to perform the statutes of Thy will. Thou hast caused us to inherit seasons of joy and feasts of free will gifts, and hast given us as an heritage the holiness of the Sabbath, the glory of the appointed time, and the celebration of the festival. Thou hast made a distinction between the holiness of the Sabbath and that of the festival, and hast hallowed the seventh day above the six working days ; Thou hast distinguished and sanctified Thy people Israel by Thy holiness. And Thou hast given us," etc. 

MISHNAH III 

Whoever says [in his Tefillah] "To a bird's nest do Thy mercies extend[1]" or "For the good be Thy name remembered[2]" or "We give thanks, we give thanks[3]," him do we silence. 

GEMARA

It is right that we silence him who says, "We give thanks, we give thanks," because he makes it appear as though there were two Powers[4]; and likewise him who says, "For the good be Thy name remembered," the inference being that for the good [may it be remembered] but not for the bad ; and we have a Mishnaic teaching : A man is in duty bound to utter a benediction for the bad even as he utters one for the good[5]. But why [do we silence him who says], "To a bird's nest do Thy mercies extend"? Two Amoraim in the West[6] differ, viz. : R Jose b. Abin and R. Jose b. Zebida : one said : Because he causes jealousy between God's creatures[7] ; the other said : Because he makes the ordinances of the Holy One, blessed be He, to be simply acts of mercy, whereas they are injunctions[8]. 

A certain man went down [to the Ark][9] in the presence of Rabbah and said, "Thou hast compassion on a bird's nest ; do Thou have compassion and mercy upon us." Rabbah exclaimed, "How this Rabbinical scholar knows how to find favour with his Lord[10]!" Abbai said to him, "Lo, we have learnt in the Mishnah: We silence him!" But Rabbah merely wished to test Abbai[11]. 

A certain man went down [to the Ark] in the presence of R. Hannina. He said[1], "O God, the great, the mighty, the revered, the glorious, the powerful, the feared, the strong, the courageous, the certain, the honoured." R. Hannina waited until he had finished. When he had finished, he said to him, "Hast thou exhausted all the praises of thy Lord? What is the use of all those [adjectives]? The three which we do say[2], if Moses our teacher had not used them in the Torah[3] and the men of the Great Assembly[4] come and instituted them in the Tefillah, we should not have been able to say ; and thou dost go on saying all those!" A parable : [It may be likened] to a human king who possessed a million golden denarii[5], and people kept praising him as the possessor of [a million denarii of][6] silver; is it not an insult to him ? 

R. Hannina also said : Everything is in the hand of Heaven except the fear of Heaven[7]; as it is said, "And now, O Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee but to fear" (Deut. x. 12). Is, then, the fear of Heaven a small thing[8]? Lo, R. Hannina has said in the name of R. Simeon b. Johai[9] : The Holy One, blessed be He, has in His treasury nothing but the store of heavenly fear; as it is said, "And the fear of the Lord which is His treasure" (Is. xxxiii. 6) ! Yes, in the estimation of Moses it was a small thing ; for R. Hannina said : A parable : [It may be likened] to a man from whom a large vessel is required ; possessing it, it seems to him small ; but if he does not possess it, though it be small, it seems to him large. 

[ Who says], "We give thanks," him do we silence. 

R. Zera said : Whoever says Shema', Shema'[10] is like him who says "We give thanks, we give thanks" [and is to be silenced]. Against this is quoted : He who reads the Shema' and repeats the words is to be reprimanded. He is to be reprimanded, but not silenced ! There is no contradiction. This refers to one who repeats it word by word ; but the former refers to him who repeats it verse by verse[1]. Rab Pappa asked Abbai : But perhaps he at first did not direct his mind and finally did so[2]! He replied : Has [[fol. 34a.]] anyone intimacy with Heaven[3] ? If he did not at first direct his mind [to his prayer], we smite him with a smith's hammer until he does direct his mind[4]. 

MISHNAH IV 

He who says in his Tefillah "The good bless Thee" behold this is the way of error[5]. If a man step before the Ark[6] and make a mistake [in the Tefillah], another replaces him ; and at such a time, one may not decline[7]. From where does the latter begin? From the commencement of the benediction where the other erred. He who steps before the Ark should not respond "Amen" after [the benedictions of] the Kohanim[8] because it might cause him confusion. If there be no other Kohen there but himself he does not raise his hands [for the priestly benediction] ; but if he is confident that he can raise his hands and return to the Tefillah[9], he is permitted. 

GEMARA 

Our Rabbis have taught : [If one is invited] to step before the Ark, he should first decline[10]; should he not do so, he is like cooking without salt. But if he decline unduly, he is like cooking spoilt by over-salting. How should he act ? The first time [of asking] he declines ; the second time he wavers ; the third time he stretches his legs and descends [before the Ark]. 

Our Rabbis have taught : There are three things where excess is bad and a small quantity pleasant : leaven, salt and declining an office. 

Rab Huna said : If he erred in the first three benedictions [of Tefillah], he commences again at the beginning; if in the middle benedictions, he returns to "Thou favourest man with knowledge[1]" ; if in the last [three], he returns to the "Service[2]." Rab Assi said : The middle benedictions have no order[3]. Rab Sheshet quoted in objection : From where does the latter begin ? From the commencement of the benediction where the other erred ! This is a refutation of Rab Huna ; but Rab Huna can reply : The middle benedictions are all one benediction[4]. 

Rab Judah said[5]: A man should never pray for his personal needs in the first three or last three benedictions, but in the middle ones. For R. Hannina[6] said : [When saying] the first three benedictions, he is like a slave recounting praise before his master ; [when saying] the middle benedictions, he is like a slave begging a reward from his master ; [when saying] the last three benedictions, he is like a slave who, receiving a reward from his master, takes his departure and goes away. 

Our Rabbis have taught : It happened that a disciple who descended before the Ark in the presence of R. Eliezer unduly prolonged [the prayers]. His disciples said to him, "Our master, what a prolonger he is!" He replied, "Did he prolong more than Moses, our teacher, of whom it is written, 'The forty days and forty nights that I fell down'" (Deut. ix. 25)? It again happened that a disciple who descended before the Ark in the presence of R. Eliezer unduly shortened [the prayers]. His disciples said to him, "What a shortener he is!" He replied, "Did he shorten more than Moses, our teacher ; for it is written, 'Heal her now, O God, I beseech Thee'" (Num. xii. 13)[7]? R. Jacob said in the name of Rab Hisda : Whoever prays on behalf of another need not mention his name ; as it is said, "Heal her now, O God, I beseech Thee," without mentioning Miriam's name. 

Our Rabbis have taught : These are the benedictions at which a man bends low ; at the beginning and end of the "Patriarchs[1]" and at the beginning and end of the "Thanksgiving[2]." Should anyone come to bend low at the end and beginning of every benediction, we tell him not to do so. R. Simeon b. Pazzi said in the name of R. Joshua b. Levi in the name of Bar Kappara : The ordinary man [acts] as we have stated ; a high priest [bends] at [[fol. 34 b.]] the end of each benediction ; a king at the beginning and end of each benediction. R. Isaac b. Nahmani said : It was explained to me by R. Joshua b. Levi : The ordinary man [acts] as we have stated ; a high priest [bends] at the beginning of each benediction ; a king, when once he bends, should not straighten himself [until the end of the Tefillah] ; as it is said, "And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the Lord, he arose from before the altar of the Lord from kneeling on his knees" (I Kings viii. 54). 

Our Rabbis have taught : "Bowing" means upon the face ; as it is said, "Then Bath Sheba bowed with her face to the earth" (ibid. i. 31). "Bending" means upon the knees[3]; as it is said, "From kneeling on his knees" (ibid. viii. 54). "Prostrating" means spreading out the hands and legs ; as it is said, " Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to prostrate ourselves to thee to the earth?" (Gen. xxxvii. 10). Rab Hiyya b. Rab Huna said : I saw Abbai and Raba just recline on their side[4]. One taught: He who bends the knee in the "Thanksgiving" is praiseworthy ; but there is another teaching : Such an one is to be reprimanded ! There is no contradiction ; one referring to the beginning, the other to the end [of the benediction]. Raba bent the knee at the beginning and end of the "Thanksgiving," The Rabbis asked him, "Why has the master acted so?" He replied, "I saw Rab Nahman bend the knee, and I saw Rab Sheshet do it. 

Moreover, the teaching : He who bends the knee in the 'Thanksgiving' is to be reprimanded — refers to the 'Thanksgiving' in the Hallel[1]." And the teaching : He who bends the knee in the "Thanksgiving" of the Tefillah and in the "Thanksgiving" of the Hallel is to be reprimanded — to what does this refer? To the "Thanksgiving" in the Grace after meals[2]. 

MISHNAH V 

If one errs while saving the Tefillah, it is a bad omen for him ; and should he be the messenger of the congregation[3], it is a bad omen for those who deputed him, since a man's deputy is similar to himself. They declared concerning R. Hannina b. Dosa[4] that when praying on behalf of the sick, he would say, "This one will live, that one will die." They asked him, "How knowest thou?" He replied, "If my prayer is fluent in my mouth, I know that he is accepted; but if not, I know that he is rejected." 

GEMARA 

To which[5]? R. Hiyya[6] stated that Rab Safra said in the name of one attached to the school of Rabbi[7]: To the "Patriarchs[8]." Others refer this [statement of Rab Safra] to the following Baraita: One who says the Tefillah must direct his heart to each benediction ; but if unable to do so to each one, he must at least direct his heart to one. To which? R. Hiyya stated that Rab Safra said in the name of one attached to the school of Rabbi : To the "Patriarchs." 

They declared concerning R. Hannina b. Dosa, etc. 

Whence is this? R. Joshua b. Levi[9] said : For the Scriptures state, "Peace, peace to him that is far off and to him that is near, saith the Lord that createth[10] the fruit of the lips; and I will heal him" (Is.lvii. 19). 

R. Hiyya b. Abba said in the name of R. Johanan : Every prophet prophesied only to marry his daughter to a disciple of the wise, and for him who transacts the affairs of a disciple of the wise and allows him to enjoy his possessions ; but as for the disciples of the wise themselves, "No eye hath seen what God, and nobody but Thee[1], will work for him that waiteth for Him" (Is. Ixiv. 3)[2]. 

R. Hiyya b. Abba also said in the name of R. Johanan : Every prophet only prophesied for the days of the Messiah ; but as for the world to come, "No eye hath seen what God, and nobody but Thee, will work for him that waiteth for Him." This is at variance with the opinion of Samuel who said : There is no difference between this world and the days of the Messiah, except the servitude of the heathen kingdoms alone ; as it is said, "For the poor shall never cease out of the land" (Deut. xv. 11)[3]. 

R. Hiyya b. Abba also said in the name of R. Johanan : Every prophet only prophesied for the penitent ; but as for the perfectly righteous, "No eye hath seen what God, and nobody but Thee, will work for him that waiteth for Him." This is at variance with the opinion of R. Abbahu who said : The place which the penitent occupy, the perfectly righteous are unable to occupy ; as it is said, "Peace, peace to him that is far off and to him that is near" — "to him that is far off [from God]" first, and then "to him that is near." But R. Johanan can reply : What means "To him that is far off"? To him who was far off from transgression from the first ; and what means "To him that is near"? To him that was near transgression and has now removed himself therefrom. 

What is the significance of "No eye hath seen" etc.? R. Joshua b. Levi said : It refers to the wine preserved in the grape from the six days of creation. R. Samuel b. Nahmani[4] said : It refers to Eden[5], upon which the eye of no creature has gazed. Perhaps thou wilt ask : Where, then, was Adam ? In the Garden. But perhaps thou wilt say that the Garden is the same as Eden ! Therefore there is a teaching to tell thee, "And a river went out of Eden to water the Garden" (Gen. ii. 10). Hence the Garden and Eden are distinct. 

Our Rabbis have taught : It once happened that the son of Rabban Gamaliel was ill. He sent two disciples of the wise to R. Hannina b. Dosa to pray on his behalf. When he saw them, he ascended to an upper chamber and prayed on his behalf. On descending he said to them, "Go, the fever has left him." They said to him, "Art thou a prophet?" He replied, "'I am no prophet nor a prophet's son' (Amos vii. 14) ; but so is my tradition : If my prayer is fluent in my mouth, I know that he is accepted ; but if not, I know that he is rejected." They sat down and wrote and noted the time. When they came to Rabban Gamaliel, he said to them, "By the Temple-service! You have neither understated nor overstated [the time]. But thus it happened ; at that very hour the fever left him, and he asked us for water to drink." 

It also happened with R. Hannina b. Dosa that he went to Torah with Rabban Johanan b. Zakkai. The son of Rabban Johanan b. Zakkai fell ill, and he said to him, "Hannina, my son ! Pray on his behalf that he may live" R. Hannina laid his head between his knees, and prayed on his behalf, and he recovered. Rabban Johanan b. Zakkai said, "Were Ben Zakkai to press his head between his knees all the day long, no notice would be taken of him." His wife said to him, "Is, then, Hannina greater than thou?" He replied, "No; he is like a slave before the King[1], and I like a nobleman before the King." 

R. Hiyya b. Abba also said in the name of R Johanan : A man should not pray except in a room which has windows ; as it is said, "Now his windows were open in his upper chamber towards Jerusalem" (Dan. vi. 11)[2]. 

R. Jacob b. Iddi said in the name of R. Johanan : Whoever prays on behalf of another need not mention his name. Whence have we this? From Moses, our teacher; as it is said, "Heal her now, O God, I beseech Thee" (Num. xii. 13), without mentioning Miriam's name[3]. 

Rab Kahana said : I consider him impertinent who prays in a valley[4]. Rab Kahana also said : I consider him impertinent who recounts his sins[5] ; as it is said, "Happy is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is pardoned[6]" (Ps. xxxii. 1). 

May we return unto thee : One must not stand.
