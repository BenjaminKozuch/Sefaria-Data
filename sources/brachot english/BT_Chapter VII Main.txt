MISHNAH I, II 

I. Three who ate together are under the obligation of Zimmun. One who has eaten Demai[1], or the first tithe[2] from which Terumah has been taken[3], or the second tithe[4] or food belonging to the Sanctuary which had been redeemed, and the attendant who has eaten food the size of an olive and the Samaritan may be included for Zimmun. One who has eaten of the untithed, or the first tithe from which Terumah has not been taken, or the second tithe or food belonging to the Sanctuary which had not been redeemed, and the attendant who has eaten Isss than the size of an olive, and the idolator[5] may not be included for Zimmun. 

II. Women, slaves and minors may not be included. How much [must one have eaten at the meal] to be included for Zimmun ? The size of an olive. R. Judah says : The size of an egg. 

GEMARA 

Whence is this derived[6]? Rab Assi said : Because the Scriptures state, "O magnify ye the Lord with me[7], and let us exalt His name together" (Ps. xxxiv. 4). R. Abbahu said : From the following, "For I will proclaim the name of the Lord; ascribe ye[8] greatness unto our God" (Deut. xxxii. 3). 

Rab Hanan b. Abba[1] said : Whence is it that he who responds "Amen" must not raise his voice above him who pronounces the benediction? As it is said, "O magnify ye the Lord with me[2], and let us exalt His name together." R. Simeon b. Pazzi said : Whence is it that the translator is not permitted to raise his voice above that of the reader[3]? As it is said, "Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice" (Exod. xix. 19) — there was no need to say "by a voice" ; what, therefore, does the teaching "by a voice" tell us? By a voice [equal to that] of Moses. There is a similar teaching : The translator is not permitted to raise his voice above that of the reader ; and if the translator is not able to pitch his voice as loud as the reader, then the reader should lower his voice and read. 

It has been reported : If two ate together, Rab and R. Johanan differ in opinion — One declares that if they wish to arrange Zimmun they may do so ; but the other declares that if they wish to do so, they may not. There is, however, the Mishnaic teaching : Three who ate together are under the obligation of Zimmun — three, yes ; two, no[4] ! There [in the case of three] it is obligatory, but here [with two] it is voluntary. Come and hear : Three who ate together are under the obligation of Zimmun and are not permitted to divide themselves up[5]. [Hence it is to be inferred that] three can and two cannot make Zimmun ! It is different there, because they originally [being three in number] laid upon themselves the obligation[6]. Come and hear : The attendant who was waiting upon two men should eat with them[7], even if they did not give him permission[8]. If he waited upon three, he should only eat with them when they give him permission ! It is different [[fol. 45 b.]] there, because it is proper for them to be placed under the obligation of Zimmun from the outset of the meal[9]. Come and hear: Women may arrange Zimmun for themselves and slaves for themselves; but women, slaves and minors may not include each other. should they desire Zimmun[1]. And although a hundred women are like two men[2], yet it teaches "Women arrange Zimmun for themselves and slaves for themselves[3]" ! It is different there, because there are many persons[4]. If so, I will quote the sequel : "Women and slaves may not include each other, should they desire Zimmun" — why not ? Are they not many persons ! It is different there, because [there is the fear] of licentiousness. 

It is to be concluded that it was Rab who said above, "If they[5] wish to arrange Zimmun, they may not" ; for Rab Dimai b. Joseph said in the name of Rab : If three ate together, and one of them went out into the street, they call to him [that they desire to include him for Zimmun, and should he consent, even in his absence] they may reckon him in for Zimmun. The reason [why they can have Zimmun without him is] that they called to him ; hence if they did not call to him, they are not [to have Zimmun][6]. It is different there, because from the outset [by being three] they placed upon themselves the obligation of Zimmun[7]. Nay, it is to be concluded that it was R. Johanan who said above, "If they[5] wish to have Zimmun, they may not" ; for Rabbah b. Bar Hannah said in the name of R. Johanan : If two ate together, one of them may comply with the requirements of the law by means of the Grace said by the other ; and we ask the question : What does he intend to inform us ? For we have the teaching : If a man heard [Grace said by another], although he does not make the responses, he has complied with the requirements of the law ! And R. Zera said : He means to tell us that there can be no Grace with Zimmun between the two of them. Thus it is to be concluded [that R. Johanan is the author of the above statement]. Raba b. Rab Huna said to Rab Huna[8] : But the Rabbis who come from the West declare : If [two] wish to have Zimmun they may ! Is it not to be supposed that they heard this from R. Johanan[1]? No, they heard it from Rab before he went down to Babylon. 

It was stated above : "Rab Dimai b. Joseph said in the name of Rab : If three ate together and one of them went into the street, they call to him and include him for Zimmun." Abbai said : That is only if they called to him and he makes the responses[2]. Mar Zotra said : This teaching only applies to three ; but with ten [they cannot include him] unless he comes back[3]. Rab Ashe objected ; On the contrary, the reverse is more probable, because nine look like ten, but two do not look like three[4] ! But the Halakah is in agreement with Mar Zotra. What is the reason ? Since it is necessary to mention the Divine Name, which is not customary with less than ten. Abbai said : We have it by tradition that if two ate together, it is a meritorious act on their part to separate[5]. There is a teaching to the same effect : If two ate together, it is a meritorious act on their part to separate. Of what does it speak here ? When both of them are learned[6] ; but if one is learned and the other illiterate, the former says Grace and the other fulfils his obligation [by listening]. 

Raba stated : The following have I said and it has been similarly reported[7] in the name of R. Zera : If three ate together, one should interrupt his meal for the other two[8] but two need not interrupt their meal for one. They need not ? Lo, Rab Pappa, i.e. he and another, interrupted the meal for Abba Mar, his son ! Rab Pappa is different, because he acted within the bounds of strict justice[9]. 

Judah b. Maremar, Mar b. Rab Ashe and Rab Aha of Difti[10] dined together, and there was not one amongst them who was more distinguished than his associates to say Grace for them. They sat on and said[11] : The Mishnah teaches : Three who ate together are under the obligation of Zimmun. That must refer only to where there is an eminent man present[1], but where they are all equal, it is preferable to separate for the purpose of the Grace. Thereupon each said Grace for himself; but when they came before Maremar, he said to them : The duty of Grace you have fulfilled, but not the duty of Zimmun ; and should you say, "Let us go back and have Grace with Zimmun," there cannot be a Zimmun retrospectively. 

If one comes in and finds them saying Grace, what response does he make ? Rab Zebid said, "Blessed be His name, yea, contiuually to be blessed for ever and ever[2]." Rab Pappa said : He responds with "Amen." There is no disagreement here ; the former refers to where he finds them saying, "Let us say Grace," the other to where he finds them saying "Blessed." If he finds them saying "Let us say Grace," he responds "Blessed be His name" etc., and if he finds them saying "Blessed," he responds "Amen." 

One taught : He who responds "Amen" after his own benedictions is praiseworthy ; but another taught : He is to be reprimanded. There is no contradiction; the former refers to "Who...rebuildest Jerusalem[3]," the latter to the other benedictions. 

Abbai responded ["Amen" to his benediction "Who...rebuildest Jerusalem"] with a loud voice for the day-labourers to hear and stand up[4], because "Who art kind and dealest kindly[5]" is not ordained by the Torah[6]. Rab Ashe used to make that response softly, so that the day-labourers should not hold "Who art kind and dealest kindly" in contempt[7]. 

R. Zera was ill. R. Abbahu went in to visit him, and took [[fol. 46 a.]] [a vow] upon himself, "If the little one with the scorched legs[8] recovers, I will make a joyous day for the Rabbis." He did recover, and R. Abbahu made a feast for all the Rabbis. When it was time to commence the meal, he said to R. Zera, "Let the master begin for us[1]." He replied, "Does not the master hold with R. Johanan's statement, 'The master of the house should break the bread'?" He commenced for them. When the time came to say Grace after meals, he said to R. Zera, "Let the master say Grace for us." He replied, "Does not the master hold with the statement of Rab Huna of Babylon, 'The one who breaks bread should say Grace after meals'?" With whose opinion was R. Abbahu in agreement? With that which R. Johanan said in the name of R. Simeon b. Johai : The master of the house breaks bread so that he may do so with a good will[2], and the guest says Grace so that he may bless his host. What benediction does he use? "May it be Thy will that the master of this house may not be put to shame in this world nor confounded in the world to come." Rabbi added to this : "And may he prosper in all his possessions[3]; may all his and our possessions be successful and near to the city[4]; may not Satan have power over the works of his hands nor over ours ; and may there not leap before him or us any thought of sin, transgression or iniquity from now and for evermore." 

Up to where is the benediction of Zimmun[5]? Rab Nahman said: Until "We will bless[6]"; but Rab Sheshet said: Until "[Blessed art Thou, O Lord,] Who givest food unto all[7]." Let us say [that their difference is] like that of the Tannaim ; for one taught : The Grace after meals [may be said by] two or three ; and there is another teaching : Three or four[8]. They hold that everybody admits that "Who art kind and dealest kindly" is not ordained by the Torah[1]. Are we, then, not to suppose that they differ on the following point : He who says, "[The Grace may be said by] two or three" holds that [the benediction of Zimmun extends] until "Who givest food unto all" ; and he who says "Three or four" holds that it extends until "We will bless"? No ; Rab Nahman reconciles [the two conflicting versions] according to his opinion, and so does Rab Sheshet. Rab Nahman reconciles them according to his opinion — Everybody agrees that [the Zimmun benediction extends] until "We will bless" ; that is quite right for him who said "Three or four," but as for him who said "Two or three," he could tell thee that we are here dealing with the Grace of the day-labourers ; for the teacher has said: Such an one opens with "Who feedest" and includes "Who ...rebuildest Jerusalem" in the benediction of "the land[2]." Rab Sheshet reconciles them according to his opinion — Everybody agrees that [the Zimmun benediction extends] until "Who givest food unto all" ; that is quite right for him who said "Two or three," but he who said "Three or four" is of the opinion that "Who art kind and dealest kindly" is ordained by the Torah[3]. 

Rab Joseph said : Thou mayest know that "Who art kind and dealest kindly" is not ordained by the Torah because day-labourers may omit it[4]. Rab Isaac b. Samuel b. Marta said in the name of Rab[1] : Thou mayest know that "Who art kind and dealest kindly" is not ordained by the Torah, because it opens with "Blessed"[2] and does not conclude with "Blessed"; according to the teaching: One commences all benedictions with "Blessed" and concludes them with "Blessed," excepting the benediction over fruits, commandments[3], one benediction which follows immediately on another, and the last benediction of the reading of the Shema'. In some of these instances one opens with "Blessed" [[fol. 46b.]] but does not conclude with it ; and in others one concludes with "Blessed" but does not commence with it. Since one opens the benediction "Who art kind and dealest kindly" with "Blessed" but does not conclude with it, the inference is that it is a benediction by itself. Rab Nahman b. Isaac said : Thou mayest know that "Who art kind and dealest kindly" is not ordained by the Torah, because they omit it in the house of a mourner[4]; according to the teaching : What do they say in the house of a mourner[5] ? "Blessed... Who art kind and dealest kindly[6]." R. 'Akiba said, "Blessed be the true Judge." Is, then, "Who art kind and dealest kindly" to be said but not "The true Judge"? Nay, the meaning is, "Who art kind and dealest kindly" is also to be said. 

Mar Zotra visited the house of Rab Ashe whom some bereavement had befallen[7]. [In the Grace after meals] he opened with the benediction[8] : "Who art kind and dealest kindly, true God and Judge, Who judgest with righteousness and in judgment takest [the souls of men unto Thyself], Who rulest in Thy world, doing therein according to Thy will, for all Thy ways are judgment and all is Thine. We are Thy people and Thy servants, and in all circumstances it is our duty to give thanks unto Thee and to bless Thee. O Thou Who repairest the breaches in Israel, mayest Thou also repair this breach in Israel, granting us life." 

To where does he return[1]? Rab Zebid said in the name of Abbai : He returns to the commencement[2] ; but the Rabbis say : To the place where he made the interruption[3]. The Halakah is — He returns to the place where he made the interruption. 

The Exilarch said to Rab Sheshet, "Although you are old[4] Rabbis, the Persians are more expert than you in the etiquette of a meal. When there are two couches, the more important guest reclines first and the other above him ; when there are three, the chief guest reclines in the centre, the next important above him and the third below him." Rab Sheshet said to him, "But should the chief guest wish to converse with him [who is above him], he would have to straighten himself and sit up to do so!" The Exilarch replied, "It is otherwise with the Persians, because he would communicate with him by gesture[5]." 

[Rab Sheshet asked the Exilarch], "With whom do [the Persians] commence to wash previous to the meal ?" He replied, "With the chief guest." "Does, then, the chief guest watch his hands[6] until all the others wash?" He replied, "They immediately set a tray before him." "With whom do they commence to wash at the conclusion of the meal?" He answered, "With the person of least importance." "Then the chief guest sits with his hands stained until they all wash!" He replied, "They do not remove the tray from before him until they set water before him." 

Rab Sheshet said [to the Exilarch] : I know a teaching, viz. : What is the procedure of reclining ? When there are two couches, the more important person reclines first, and the other below him. When there are three couches, the chief person reclines first, the next important above him, and the third below him. They begin the washing previous to the meal with the chief guest. As for the washing at the conclusion of the meal, when there are five, they commence with the chief guest; but when there are a hundred[1] they commence with the person of least importance until they reach the last five, and then they commence with the principal guest. To whom the water after the meal returns[2], [the privilege of saying] Grace likewise returns. This supports the statement of Rab ; for Rab Hiyya said in the name of Rab : He who washes his hands first at the end of a meal is delegated to say Grace. 

Rab and R. Hiyya were sitting at table in the presence of Rabbi. Rabbi said to Rab, "Arise, wash thy hands." R. Hiyya noticed that Rab was trembling[3] and said to him, "O son of princes! See, it is for the privilege of saying Grace after meals that Rabbi tells thee [to wash]." 

[[fol. 47 a.]] The Rabbis have taught : We do not honour a man on a road or bridge[4], or with [washing] the hands stained [in the course of the meal][5]. Rabin and Abbai were journeying along a road ; the ass of Rabin went in front of Abbai's, and he did not say to him, "Let the master go [first]." Abbai said [to himself], "Since this young Rabbi has come from the West[6], he has grown very conceited." When he reached the entrance of the Synagogue, Rabin said to him, "Let the master enter [first]." He retorted, "And up to now have I not been master[7] !" He replied, "Thus spake R. Johanan ; We only honour a man [by making way for him] in the case of a door which has a Mezuzah." "If there is a Mezuzah, one does ; but if there is no Mezuzah, one does not ? Then, in the case of a Synagogue or House of Study which has no Mezuzah, there also one should not honour a man [by making way for him]!" "Nay, [the meaning is,] A door which is liable to have a Mezuzah affixed[8]." 

Rab Judah the son of Rab Samuel b. Shelat said in the name of Rab: Those who recline at table are not permitted to eat anything until he who breaks bread partakes thereof. Rab Safra sat there and said, "To taste" was said [by Rab, riot "to eat"]. What is to be deduced therefrom ? That a man is in duty bound to repeat [a statement] in the exact language of his teacher[1]. 

Our Rabbis have taught : Two may wait upon each other with a dish, but three may not. The one who breaks bread puts forth his hand first[2]; but if he wishes to show respect to his teacher or his superior[3], he has the power to do so. Rabbah b. Bar Hannah was marrying his son into the family of Rab Samuel[4] b. Rab Kattina. He sat beforehand and taught his son[5] : He who is to break the bread is not permitted to do so until the response "Amen" has been completed by all. Rab Hisda said : By the majority. Rammi b. Hamma asked him, "What difference does the majority make since the benediction has not been completed[6], the minority having not yet completed it?" He replied, "I declare that whoever makes the response 'Amen' unduly [prolonged] acts in error[7]." 

Our Rabbis have taught: In responding "Amen" one should not make the word hurriedly pronounced[8] or cut short[9] or an "orphan[10]" ; nor should he hurl the benediction from his mouth[11]. Ben 'Azzai says: Whoever responds with an "orphan Amen," his sons will be orphaned, with a "hurried Amen" his days will be hurried[12], with a "cut short Amen" his days will be cut short. But whoever prolongs the "Amen," his days and years will be prolonged for him. 

Rab and Samuel were sitting at a meal. Rab Shimi b. Hiyya came and hurriedly ate his food. Rab said to him, "What is thine intention — to join with us [in saying Grace with Zimmun]? We have concluded the meal[1]." Samuel said to him, "If they brought me mushrooms or Abba[2] pigeons, should we not eat[3]?" 

Rab's disciples were sitting at a meal, and Rab[4] entered. They said, "A great man has come who will say Grace for us." He said to them, "Are you of opinion that a great man must say Grace? No, one who was at the main part of the meal should say Grace." But the Halakah is — The most important person says Grace, although he arrived at the end of the meal. 

One who has eaten Demai, etc. 

But he had no right [to eat it][5] ! If he so choose, he can renounce his possessions and become a poor man, and then he would have the right [to eat it] ; for we have a Mishnaic teaching : We may feed the poor and soldiers[6] on Demai. But Rab Huna has said : It has been taught : Bet Shammai declare that we may not feed the poor and soldiers on Demai[7]. 

The first tithe from, which Terumah has been taken. 

This is evident[8] ! No ; it is necessary to state it for the case where [the Levite] anticipated with the ears of corn and separated therefrom the Terumah of the tithe before [the priest] had separated the great Terumah[9]. This is in accord with R. Abbahu who said in the name of R. Simeon b. Lakish : The first tithe, which [the Levite] anticipated and separated from the ears, is exempt from the great Terumah ; as it is said, "Ye shall set apart of it a gift for the Lord, even a tithe of the tithe" (Num. xviii. 26) — i.e. "a tithe of the tithe" I tell thee [to set apart], but not a great Terumah or a Terumah of a tithe of a tithe. Rab Pappa said to Abbai : In that case, even if [the Levite] anticipated [and separated his tithe] from the corn-heap[1], it would likewise [be exempt from the great Terumah] ! He replied : To meet thy objection the Scriptures state, "Out of all your tithes[2] ye shall set apart" (Num. xviii. 29). [[fol. 47b.]] What, however, seest thou[3]? The latter is corn but the other is not[4]. 

The second tithe or food belonging to the Sanctuary which had been redeemed. 

This is evident[5] ! With what are we here dealing ? For instance, if he paid its value but not the additional fifth[6] ; hence he informs us that [not having paid] the additional fifth does not prevent him [from being included for Zimmun]. 

The attendant who has eaten food the size of an olive. 

This is evident[7] ! Perhaps thou mayest argue that the attendant has no fixed place[8]; therefore we are informed [that he is to be included]. 

The Samaritan may be included for Zimmun. 

Why should he be? He is nothing better than an 'Am ha'ares, and there is a teaching : 'Amme ha'ares are not to be included for Zimmun ! Abbai said : It refers to a Samaritan who is a Haber. Raba said : Thou mayest even suppose that it refers to a Samaritan who is an 'Am ha'ares, and we are here dealing with the 'Am ha'ares so designated by the Rabbis who disagree in this matter with R. Meir. For there is a teaching : Who is an 'Am ha'ares? Whoever does not eat his non-holy food[9] in a condition of ritual purity — these are the words of R. Meir ; but the Sages say : Whoever does not properly tithe his fruits. These Samaritans, however, do properly apportion the tithe, for they are careful to observe what is written in the Torah[10]. The teacher has said : The commandments to which the Samaritans adhere they observe more scrupulously than the Israelite. 

Our Rabbis have taught : Who is an 'Am ha'ares? Whoever does not read the Shema' evening and morning — these are the words of R. Eliezer; but R. Joshua says : Whoever does not lay Tefillin. Ben 'Azzai says : Whoever has no Sisit on his garment[1]. R. Nathan says : Whoever has no Mezuzah on his door. R. Nathan[2] b. Joseph says : Whoever has sons and does not rear them to the study of Torah. Others declare : Even if one has studied Torah and Mishnah but has not ministered to the disciples of the wise[3], he is an 'Am ha'ares. Rab Huna said : The Halakah is in accord with the last mentioned. 

Rammi b. Hamma refused to include for Zimmun Rab Menashya b.Tahlifa who taught Sifra, Sifre[4] and the Halakah. When Rammi b. Hamma departed this life, Raba said : He only died because he refused to include Rab Menashya b. Tahlifa for Zimmun. But there is a teaching : Others declare ; Even if one has studied Torah and Mishnah but has not ministered to the disciplas of the wise, he is an 'Am ha'ares[5] ! It is different with Rab Menashya b. Tahlifa because he did minister to the Rabbis, but Rammi b. Hamma failed to make careful inquiry about him. Another version is : Rab Menashya heard the teachings from the mouth of the Rabbis and studied them, and therefore was like a Rabbinical scholar. 

One who has eaten of the untithed, or the first tithe, etc. 

[If he has eaten of] the untithed, it is evident [that he should not be included]! No; it was necessary to state it because of the untithed which is so designated by the Rabbis. How is this meant? As referring to that which grows in an unperforated pot[6]. 

The first tithe from which Terumah has not been taken. 

That is evident ! No ; it is necessary [to mention it] for the case where [the Levite] anticipated [the priest by taking the tithe] from the corn-heap[1]. Thou mayest argue that it is as Rab Pappa said to Abbai[2]. Therefore we are informed that it is as Abbai answered him[3]. 

The second tithe or food belonging to the Sanctuary which had not been redeemed. 

This is evident ! No ; it is necessary [to mention it] for the case where it has been redeemed but not according to the Halakah. With "the second tithe," for instance, where he redeemed it with uncoined silver, whereas the All-merciful declared, "Thou shalt bind up the money in thy hand" (Deut. xiv. 25) — i.e. money which has a stamp upon it[4]. With "food belonging to the Sanctuary" for which [for instance] he had given a piece of land in exchange but he had not redeemed with money ; whereas the All-merciful declared, "He shall add the fifth part of the money of thy valuation unto it, and it shall be assured to him" (Lev. xxvii. 19)[5]. 

And the attendant who has eaten less than the size of an olive. 

That is evident[6] ! But since he taught the first clause relating to food the size of an olive, he also teaches the latter clause relating to food less than the size of an olive. 

And the idolator[7] may not be included for Zimmun. 

That is evident ! With what are we here dealing ? With a proselyte who has been circumcised but not undergone immersion ; for R. Zera said in the name of R. Johanan[8] : He is certainly not to be regarded as a proselyte until he has been circumcised and undergone immersion, and so long as he has not undergone immersion he is still a non-Jew. 

II. Women, slaves and minors may not be included for Zimmun, 

R. Jose[1] said : An infant lying in the cradle may be included for Zimmun. But lo, there is our Mishnaic teaching : Women, slaves and minors may not be included! R. Jose is in agreement with the statement of R. Joshua b. Levi who said : Although they declare that an infant lying in the cradle may not be included for Zimmun, yet we may consider him an addition. to make up a quorum of ten[2]. 

R. Joshua b. Levi also said : Nine [free] men and a slave may be reckoned together for a quorum[3]. Against this is quoted : It happened that R. Eliezer went into a Synagogue and did not find ten there, so he freed his slave and with him completed the requisite number. Since he freed him he was [included], but had he not freed him, he would not ! Two had been required [to complete the quorum], so he freed one slave and fulfilled the obligation [of having ten] with the other. But how could he act thus ? For lo, Rab Judah declared : Whoever frees his slave transgresses a command of the Torah ; as it is said, "Of them shall ye take your bondmen for ever" (Lev. xxv. 46) ! For the purpose of fulfilling a religious duty it is different. But it is fulfilling a religious duty through the means of a transgression[4] ! The fulfilling of a religious duty which affects the many[5] is different. 

R. Joshua b. Levi also said : A man should always go early to the Synagogue so that he may have the merit of being counted with the tirst ten ; for even if a hundred come after him, he receives upon himself the reward of them all. The reward of them all, dost imagine? Nay, he means to say, he is given a reward equal to them all. 

Rab Huna said : Nine and the Ark[6] may be reckoned together for a quorum. Rab Nahman asked him : Is the Ark a man ! But, said Rab Huna, since nine look like ten, they may be reckoned together. Another version is : When they are gathered together[1]; another version is : When they are scattered. 

R. Ammi said : Two and the Sabbath[2] may be reckoned together for Zimmun. Rab Nahman asked him : Is the Sabbath a man! But, said R. Ammi, two disciples of the wise who sharpen [their minds] one against the other with the study of Halakah may be reckoned together [for Zimmun]. Rab Hisda declared : For instance, I and Rab Sheshet. Rab Sheshet declared : For instance, I and Rab Hisda. 

R. Johanan said[3] : A minor who develops puberty prematurely may be included for Zimmun. There is a teaching to the same effect : A minor who shows signs of puberty[4] is to be included, but if he does not show such signs[5] he is not to be included ; we are, however, not to be very particular with a minor[6]. But this is self-contradictory ! Thou sayest : If he shows signs of puberty he is [to be included], but if not, he is not ; and then it continues, "We are, however, not to be very particular with a minor" ! What does this mean to include? Surely it is to include the boy who [[fol. 48a.]] develops puberty prematurely. But the Halakah is not in agreement with any of these teachings, but with that which Rab Nahman said : A minor who understands to Whom we say Grace is to be included for Zimmun. 

Abbai and Raba[7] were sitting in the presence of Rabbah. He asked them, "To Whom do we say Grace[8]?" They replied, "The All-merciful." "And where does the All-merciful dwell?" Raba pointed upwards to the ceiling ; Abbai went outside and pointed towards the heavens. Rabbah said to them, "Both of you are Rabbis ; for that is what the proverb says, 'Every pumpkin is known by its stem[1]'." 

Rab Judah b. Rab Samuel b. Shelat said in the name of Rab : If nine ate corn-food and one ate vegetables, they are to be reckoned together[2]. R. Zera[3] said, "I asked Rab Judah, 'How is it with eight or seven[4] ?' He replied, 'It makes no difference.' Concerning six there was[5] no need for me to ask." R. Jeremiah said to him, "Well hast thou done in not asking [about six]. What is the reason there[6]? Because there is a majority [who have eaten cornfood]." But here also [with six] there is a majority ! But R. Zera was of opinion that we require a clearly recognisable majority[7].
 
King Jannaeus and his Queen were dining together, and since he had put the Rabbis[8] to death, he had nobody to say Grace for them. He said to his wife, "Would that we had somebody to say Grace for us." She said to him, "Swear to me that if I bring thee such a man, thou wilt not harm him." He swore to her ; and she brought him her brother, Simeon b. Shetah[9]. The king gave him a seat between himself and her, and said to him, "See how much honour I pay thee." He replied, "It is not thou that honourest me, but it is the Torah that brings me honour ; for it is written, 'Extol her, and she will exalt thee ; she will bring thee honour when thou dost embrace her' (Prov. iv. 8)[10]." The king said to him, "Thou seest they[11] do not accept any lordship[12]!" He was handed a cup of wine to say Grace. He said, "How shall I word the Grace[1]? ' Blessed be He of Whose bounty Jannaeus and his companions have eaten'?" He drank the cup of wine. They gave him another cup of wine and then he said Grace. 

R. Abba b. R. Hiyya b. Abba said[2] : Simeon b. Shetah who did this[3] acted so on his own account[4]. For thus said R. Hiyya b. Abba in the name of R. Johanan : Nobody can cause others to have complied with the requirements of the law[5] until he has eaten corn-food of the size of an olive. Against this is quoted : Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel says : If one has ascended [the couch] and reclined with them, even though he has not dipped with them except the smallest quantity[6] and has not eaten with them except a single dried fig, he is to be reckoned with them [for Grace] ! Yes, he may be reckoned with them, but he is unable to cause others to comply with the requirements of the law until he has eaten corn-food of the size of an olive. It has been similarly reported : Rab Hanna[7] b. Judah said in the name of Raba : Even if he has not dipped with them except the smallest quantity and [[fol. 48 b.]] has not eaten with them except a single dried fig, he is to be reckoned with them, but as for causing others to comply with the requirements of the law, that he cannot do until he has eaten cornfood of the size of an olive. Rab Hanna b. Judah said in the name of Raba : The Halakah is — If he has eaten a single cabbage-leaf and drunk a cup of wine, he is to be reckoned with them ; but as for causing others to comply with the requirements of the law, that he cannot do until he has eaten corn-food of the size of an olive. 

Rab Nahman said : Moses instituted for Israel the benediction "Who feedest[8]" at the time the manna descended for them. Joshua instituted for them the benediction of "the land[9]" when they entered the land [of Canaan]. David and Solomon instituted [what follows] until[10] "Who... rebuildest Jerusalem[11]." David instituted "[Have mercy, O Lord our God] upon Israel Thy people, upon Jerusalem Thy city," and Solomon[12] instituted "and upon the great and holy House." The benediction "Who art kind and dealest kindly[1]" was instituted in Jabneh[2] in connection with the slain of Bethar[3] ; for Rab Mattena said : On the day the slain of Bethar were allowed burial, there was instituted in Jabneh the benediction "Who art kind and dealest kindly" — "Who art kind," because the bodies did not decompose[4] ; "and dealest kindly," because they were allowed burial. 

Our Rabbis have taught : The following is the order of the Grace after meals : The first benediction is "Who feedest" ; the second, the benediction of "the land"; the third, "Who...rebuildest Jerusalem" ; the fourth, "Who art kind and dealest kindly." On the Sabbath, one begins and ends with consolation and refers to the sanctity of the day in the middle[5]. R. Eliezer says: If he wishes to include [the reference to the Sabbath] in the "consolation," he may do so ; in the benediction of "the land," he may do so ; in the benediction instituted by the Sages in Jabneh, he may do so. The Sages, however, say : He should only include it in the "consolation." Then the Sages agree with the first Tanna[6]! There is a point of difference between them, viz. : the post factum[7]. 

Our Rabbis have taught : Whence do we derive the Grace after meals from the Torah? As it is said, "And thou shalt eat and be satisfied and bless" (Deut. viii. 10) — this refers to the benediction "Who feedest"; "the Lord thy God" (ibid.)— to the benediction of Zimmun; "for the land" (ibid.) — to the benediction of "the land" ; "the good" (ibid.) — to "Who. . . rebuildest Jerusalem," for so it states "That goodly hill-country and Lebanon" (ibid. iii. 25); "which He hath given thee" (ibid. viii. 10) — to "Who art kind and dealest kindly." I have here only the Grace after meals ; whence do we derive the Grace before meals ? Thou canst reason by a fortiori argument — if a man should bless God when satisfied, how much more so when he is hungry[1] ! 

Rabbi says[2] : "And thou shalt eat and be satisfied and bless" refers to the benediction "Who feedest," but the benediction of Zimmun is derived from "Magnify the Lord with me" (Ps. xxxiv. 4)[3] ; "for the land" — to the benediction of "the land" ; "the good"— to "Who...rebuildest Jerusalem," for so it states "That goodly hill-country and Lebanon"; the benediction "Who art kind and dealest kindly" was instituted in Jabneh. I have here only the Grace after meals ; whence do we derive the Grace before meals ? There is a teaching to state, "Which He hath given thee" — ie. as soon as He hath given thee[4]. 

R. Isaac said : [This reasoning] is unnecessary. Behold it states, "And He will bless thy bread and water" (Exod. xxiii. 25)— read not "And He will bless" [uberak] but "And bless thou" [ubarak]. When is it called "bread[5]" ? Before one eats it[6]. 

R. Nathan[7] said : [This reasoning] is unnecessary. Behold it states, "As soon as ye are come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat ; for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice ; and afterwards they eat that are bidden" (I Sam. ix. 13)[8]. Why all this[9]? [10]Because women are garrulous. Samuel[11] said: The women did it in order to gaze upon Saul's beauty; for it is written, "From his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people" (ibid. V. 2). R. Johanan said : [The women did it] because one reign must not encroach upon another even a hair's breadth[12]. 

I have here only the benediction for meals ; whence is the benediction over Torah derived? R. Ishmael said : By a fortiori reasoning — for temporal life[1] one says a benediction ; how much more so for the life of the world to come[2]! R. Hiyya b. Nahmani[3], the disciple of R. Ishmael, says in the name of R. Ishmael : [This reasoning] is unnecessary ; for it states, "For the good land which He hath given thee" (Deut. viii. 10) and elsewhere it is stated, "And I will give thee the tables of stone, and the law and the commandments," etc. (Exod. xxiv, 12)[4]. 

R. Meir said : Whence is it that as one blesses for the good so should he bless for the bad[5]? There is a teaching to state, "Which the Lord thy God hath given unto thee" (Deut. xxvi. 11) — He is thy judge in every circumstance wherein He judgeth thee, whether it be with the attribute of goodness or the attribute of punishment[6]. R. Judah b. Batyra said : [This reasoning] is unnecessary ; for it states, "Good" (Deut. viii. 7) and "the good" (ibid. V. 10)[7] — "good" i.e. Torah, as it is said "For I give you good doctrine" (Prov. iv. 2); "the good" i.e. the rebuilding of Jerusalem, as it is said "That goodly[8] hill-country and Lebanon" (Deut. iii. 25)[9].
 
There is a teaching : R. Eliezer[10] says : Whoever does not say "a desirable, good and ample land" in the benediction of "the land" and "the kingdom of the house of David" in "Who...rebuildest Jerusalem" has not complied with the requirements of the law. Nahum the Elder says : He must mention the Covenant[11] in the blessing of "the land." R. Jose says : He must mention the Torah therein[12]. Pelemo says : He must refer to the Covenant before the Torah, because the latter was given with a three-fold covenant but the former with a thirteen-fold covenant[1]. R. Abba[2] [[fol. 49 a.]] says : One must mention thanksgiving therein at the commencement and conclusion[3], and he who shortens [the Grace] must not omit more than one of them ; for whoever omits more than one of them is to be reprimanded. Whoever concludes the benediction of "the land" with the words "[Blessed art Thou, O Lord,] Who givest lands as a heritage," or the benediction "Who...rebuildest Jerusalem" with the words "Who savest Israel" is a boor. And whoever does not include a reference to the Covenant and the Torah in the benediction of "the land" and a reference to the kingdom of the house of David in the benediction "Who...rebuildest Jerusalem" has not complied with the requirements of the law. This supports the teaching of R. El'ai who stated that R. Abba b. Aha[4] said in the name of our master : Whoever omits the reference to the Covenant and the Torah in the benediction of "the land" and to the kingdom of the house of David in the benediction "Who...rebuildest Jerusalem" has not complied with the requirements of the law. 

Abba Jose b. Dostai[5] and the Rabbis disagree, one declaring that "Who art kind and dealest kindly" requires a reference to the [Divine] Kingship[6], the other declaring that it does not. He who contends that it requires a reference to the Kingship is of opinion that this benediction was ordained by the Rabbis[7], and he who contends that it does not is of opinion that the benediction is ordained by the Torah[8]. 

Our Rabbis have taught : How should one conclude the benediction of the rebuilding of Jerusalem? R. Jose b. R. Judah says[1] : "Who savest Israel." Is one to say "Who savest Israel" and not "Who...rebuildest Jerusalem[2]"? Nay, [it means,] one also says "Who savest Israel." Rabbah b. Rab Huna visited the house of the Exilarch. [When saying Grace,] the latter opened with one and concluded with two[3]. Rab Hisda asked: What advantage is there in concluding with two? Moreover there is a teaching : Rabbi says : We should not conclude with two ! 

It has just been stated : "Rabbi says : We should not conclude with two." Levi quoted against Rabbi, "For the land and for the food[4]" ! It means, "The land which yields food[5]." "For the land and for the fruits[6]"! It means "The land which yields fruits." "Who hallowest Israel and the seasons[7]"! It means, "Israel who sanctify the seasons." "Who sanctifiest Israel and the beginnings of the months[8]"! It means, "Israel who hallow the beginnings of the months." "Who hallowest the Sabbath, Israel and the seasons[7]" ! This is an exception. Why is it different[9]? Here it is one idea, but there it is two, each distinct from the other. What is the reason that we do not conclude with two ? We must not perform commandments in bundles[10]. How is it, then, in this matter? Rab Sheshet said : If one opens with "Have mercy... upon Israel Thy people," he concludes with "Who savest Israel" ; if one opens with "Have mercy... upon Jerusalem Thy city," he concludes with "Who...rebuildest Jerusalem." Rab Nahman[11] said: Even if one opens with "Have mercy... upon Israel Thy people," he should conclude with "Who... rebuildest Jerusalem"; because it is said, "The Lord doth build up Jerusalem, He gathereth together the dispersed of Israel" (Ps. cxlvii. 2) — when "doth the Lord build up Jerusalem"? At the time that "He gathereth together the dispersed of Israel[1]." 

R. Zera[2] said to Rab Hisda, "Let the master come and teach." He replied, "[The regulations concerning] Grace after meals have I not learnt, so shall I teach !" R. Zera asked him, "How is that?" He replied, "When I visited the house of the Exilarch and said the Grace after meals, Rab Sheshet stretched his neck over me like a serpent[3]." "But why ?" " Because I made no reference to the Covenant, the Torah or the Kingship." "And why didst thou not mention them?" "In accord with the statement of Rab Hananel in the name of Rab, viz. : If one has not referred to the Covenant, the Torah and the Kingship, he has complied with the requirements of the law — 'the Covenant' because it does not apply to women ; 'the Tordh and the Kingship' because they apply neither to women nor slaves." "And thou didst abandon all these Tannaim and Amoraim[4] and act according to the view of Rab[5]!" 

Rabbah b. Bar Hannah said in the name of R. Johanan : The benediction "Who art kind and dealest kindly" requires a reference to the Kingship. What does he intend to tell us — that a benediction which contains no reference to the Kingship has not the name of benediction ? But R. Johanan has already told us this once[6] ! R. Zera[7] said : He means to say that it needs two references to the Kingship, one for its own sake[8] and one for "Who...rebuildest Jerusalem." If so, three are required — one for its own sake, one for "Who...rebuildest Jerusalem" and one for the benediction of "the land"; for, why should not the benediction of "the land" have one? Because it is a benediction which is connected with the preceding[9]. Then "Who...rebuildest Jerusalem" should likewise not require one because it is a benediction which is connected with the preceding! Strictly speaking, even "Who...rebuildest Jerusalem" does not require one ; but since it mentions the kingdom of the house of David, it is not proper to omit a reference to the [Divine] Kingship. Rab Pappa said : This is what R. Zera meant to say: It requires two references to Kingship besides the one for its own sake[1]. 

R. Zera sat behind Rab Giddel and Rab Giddel sat before Rab Huna ; he sat and said : If one erred and omitted to mention the reference to the Sabbath [in the Grace after meals][2], he says "Blessed be He Who has given Sabbaths for rest to His People Israel in love for a sign and a covenant. Blessed [art Thou, O Lord,] Who sanctifiest the Sabbath." Rab Huna asked Rab Giddel : Who said that ? Rab. Again he sat and said : If one erred and omitted to mention the reference to the Festival[3], he says, "Blessed be He Who has given Festivals to His people Israel for rejoicing and a memorial. Blessed... Who Sanctifiest Israel and the seasons." He asked him: Who said that? Rab. Again he sat and said : If one erred and omitted to mention the reference to the New Moon he says, "Blessed be He Who has given beginnings of the month to His people Israel for a memorial" ; but I do not know whether he adds the words "and for rejoicing" or not, whether he adds a conclusion to the benediction or not, or whether it is his own or his master's[4]. 

Giddel b. Minjomi was standing[5] before Rab Nahman. Rab Nahman made a mistake [in the Grace] and returned to the commencement. [[fol. 49 b.]] He asked him, "Why did the master do so"?" He replied, "Because Rab Shela[6] has said in the name of Rab: If one erred, he should return to the commencement." "But Rab Huna has declared in the name of Rab : If one erred, he should say 'Blessed be He Who has given' [etc.] " ! He said to him, "Was it not reported in this connection : Rab Menashya b. Tahlifa said in the name of Rab: This teaching only applies if he has not commenced the benediction 'Who art kind and dealest kindly' ; but if he has commenced it, he must return to the beginning?" 

Rab Iddi b. Abin said in the name of Rab 'Amram, in the name of Rab Nahman, in the name of Samuel[1]: If one erred and omitted the reference to the New Moon in the Tefillah[2] we make him repeat it: in the Grace after meals[3] we do not make him repeat it. Rab Abin[4] asked Rab 'Amram, "Why is the Tefillah different from the Grace after meals in this respect?" He replied, "To me also that was a difficulty and I put the question to Rab Nahman, who told me, 'I have not heard the reason from the master, Samuel' ; but let us see : With regard to the Tefillah which is an obligation, we make him repeat it ; but with regard to the Grace after meals, where one can eat or not eat just as he pleases, we do not make him repeat it." "But now, on the Sabbaths and Festivals, when there is no question of his not eating[5], then also, if he erred, he should repeat it !" He replied, "Quite so ; for Rab Shela said in the name of Rab : If he erred, he must recommence at the beginning." "But Rab Huna declared in the name of Rab : If one erred, he says 'Blessed be He Who has given'[6]!" "Has it not been reported in that connection : 'This teaching only applies if he has not commenced the benediction "Who art kind and dealest kindly" ; but if he has started it, he recommences at the beginning'?" 

How much [must one have eaten at the meal] to he included for Zimmun ?

That is to say, R. Meir considers it to be the size of an olive and R. Judah the size of an egg. But we have been told the reverse ; for there is a Mishnaic teaching : And so, he who went from Jerusalem and recalled that he had with him holy flesh [7], if he has passed Sofim[8], he burns it where he is ; but if not, he turns back and burns it before the Temple with some of the wood piled on the altar. How much [of the holy flesh must one have to make such a return necessary]? R. Meir says : In either case[9] the size of an egg ; but R. Judah says : In either case the size of an olive[1]! R. Johanan said: The statement must be reversed[2]. Abbai said : There is certainly no necessity to reverse it ; for here[3] they differ in the interpretation of Scripture : R. Meir holds, "And thou shalt eat" (Deut. viii. 10) — i.e. eating; "and thou shalt be satisfied" — i.e. drinking ; and "eating" means the minimum quantity of the size of an olive. R. Judah, on the other hand, holds, "And thou shalt eat and be satisfied" — i.e. eating wherein is some satisfaction; and what is that? That is the minimum quantity of the size of an egg. But in the other case[4], they differ in reasoning; R. Meir holds that his return must be equal to his defilement — as his defilement[5] is only possible by means of something of the minimum size of an egg, so must his return be necessitated by holy flesh of the minimum size of an egg. R. Judah, however, holds that his return must be equal to his prohibition[6] — as his prohibition is with something of the minimum size of an olive, so must his return be necessitated by holy flesh of the minimum size of an olive. 

MISHNAH III 

How do we [say Grace] with Zimmun ? With three persons [at table], one says "We will bless [Him of Whose bounty we have partaken]" ; with three and himself, he says "Bless ye [Him of Whose bounty]" etc. With ten, one says "We will bless our God [of Whose bounty]" etc.; with ten and himself , he says "Bless ye..." and that is the same whether there be ten or ten myriads[7]. With a hundred, one says "We will bless the Lord our God..."; with a hundred and himself, he says "Bless ye [the Lord our God]" etc. With a thousand, one says "We will bless the Lord our God, the God of Israel..." ; with a thousand and himself, he says "Bless ye...." With ten thousand, one says "We will bless the Lord our God, the God of Israel, the God of hosts, Who is enthroned above the Cherubim, for the food of which we have partaken" ; with ten thousand and himself, he says "Bless ye...." As he blesses, exactly so do they respond after him: "Blessed be the Lord our God, the God of Israel, the God of hosts, Who is enthroned above the Cherubim, for the food of which we have partaken." R. Jose of Galilee says: According to the numerical size of the assembly do they determine the form of the benediction; as it is said, "Bless ye God in full assemblies, even the Lord, ye that are from the fountain of Israel" (Ps. Ixviii. 27). R. 'Akiba said: What do we find in the Synagogue? Whether many or few, one says "Bless ye the Lord[1]." R. Ishmael says : "Bless ye the Lord Who is to be blessed." 

GEMARA 

Samuel said : A man should never exclude himself from the general body[2]. But there is our Mishnaic teaching : With three and himself, he says "Bless ye"! He means to say "Bless ye also"; but in any case "We will bless" is preferable. But Rab [[fol. 50a.]] Adda b. Ahabah declared : The school of Rab say : We have the teaching: Six people [who eat together] should divide themselves up[3], and so up to ten[4]. That is quite right if thou sayest "We will bless" is preferable, and therefore they are to be divided up; but if thou sayest "Bless ye" is preferable, why should they be divided up[5]? Is it not, then, to be concluded that "We will bless" is preferable? Draw that conclusion. There is a teaching to the same effect[6]: Whether one says "Bless ye" or "We will bless," we should not take him to task on that account[7] ; but punctilious people do[8]. 

Also, from the form of benediction used by a man it may be recognised whether he is a disciple of the wise or not. How is this ? Rabbi declares : [If he says] "And through Whose goodness [we live]," he is a disciple of the wise ; but if "And from Whose goodness[1]," he is a boor. Abbai said to Rab Dimai : But it is written, "And from Thy blessing let the house of Thy servant be blessed for ever" (II Sam. vii, 29) ! With a petition it is different[2]. With a petition likewise it is written, "Open thy mouth wide[3], and I will fill it" (Ps. Ixxxi. 11) ! This is written in connection with words of Torah[4].
 
There is a teaching : Rabbi declares : If one says "Through Whose goodness we live" he is a disciple of the wise ; if he says "[Through Whose goodness] they live" he is a boor. The Rabbis of Neharbel[5] taught the reverse[6]; but the Halakah is not in agreement with them. 

R. Johanan declared : [If he says] "We will bless Him of Whose bounty we have partaken" he is a disciple of the wise ; if he says "[We will bless] the One of Whose bounty we have partaken" he is a boor[7]. But Aha b. Raba[8] said to Rab Ashe : But we say : "[We will bless] the One Who has performed for our fathers and for us all these miracles[9]" ! He replied : Here it is obvious that it is the Holy One, blessed be He, Who performed the miracles. R. Johanan declared : [If he says] "Blessed be He of Whose bounty we have partaken" he is a disciple of the wise ; but if he says "[Blessed be He] for the food of which we have partaken," he is a boor[10]. Rab Huna b. Rab Joshua said : This refers only to three, where the Divine Name is not mentioned ; but with ten, where the Name is mentioned, the matter is clear[11]. As our Mishnah teaches : As he blesses, exactly so do they respond after him: "Blessed be the Lord our God, the God of Israel, the God of hosts, Who is enthroned above the Cherubim, for the food of which we have partaken[1]." 

Whether ten or ten myriads. 

This is self-contradictory ! Thou sayest : Whether ten or ten myriads, implying that they are the same[2]; and then it continues: With a hundred, one says ; With a thousand, one says ; With ten thousand, one says ! Rab Joseph said : There is no contradiction, the latter being the statement of R. Jose of Galilee, the other of R. 'Akiba. For the Mishnah declares : R. Jose of Galilee says : According to the numerical size of the assembly do they bless; as it is said, "Bless ye God in full assemblies." 

R. 'Akiba said : What do we find in the Synagogue ? 

What does R. 'Akiba make of the verse quoted by R. Jose of Galilee ? He requires that for the following teaching : R. Meir says : Whence is it derived that even the embryos in their mothers' womb sang the song at the Red Sea? As it is said, "Bless ye God in full assemblies[3], even the Lord, ye that are from the fountain of Israel" (Ps. Ixviii. 27). And the other[4]? He derives it from the word "fountain"[5]. Raba said : The Halakah is in agreement with R. 'Akiba. Rabina and Rab Hamma b. Buzi visited the house of the Exilarch. [When about to say Grace] Rab Hamma stood up and looked about to see whether there were a hundred people present. Rabina said to him : It is unnecessary ; thus said Raba : The Halakah is in agreement with R. 'Akiba[6]. 

Raba said : When we dine at the house of the Exilarch, we say Grace in threes[7]. But they should have said Grace in tens[8] ! If the Exilarch had heard, he would have been angry[9]. But they could have fulfilled their duty by means of the Grace said by the Exilarch ! Since everybody made the responses in a loud voice, it could not be heard. 

Rabbah Tospaah said : If three were dining together, and one finishing before the others says Grace for himself, they fulfil the obligation of Zimmun with him, but not he with them ; because the Zimmun cannot be retrospective[1]. 

R. Ishmael says. 

Rafram b. Pappa visited the Synagogue of Abi Gibar[2]. He stood up, read in the Scroll and exclaimed, "Bless ye the Lord"; he then stopped and did not say "Who is to be blessed." They all shouted "Bless ye the Lord Who is to be blessed," Raba said: Thou black pot[3]! What hast thou to do with this controversy? Moreover, everybody acts in accord with the opinion of R. Ishmael. 

MISHNAH IV, V 

IV. Three who have eaten together are not permitted to separate [before Grace], and, similarly with four or five. Six may divide themselves [into two parties for Zimmun] up to ten. But ten may not divide themselves up, [and similarly] up to twenty. 

V. If two parties eat in the same room, should some of one party be visible to some of the other party, they may be reckoned together for Zimmun[4]; but if not, each party arranges Zimmun for itself. We may not say the benediction over wine until water has been added to it[5]. These are the words of R. Eliezer ; but the Sages say : The benediction may be pronounced [over wine without dilution]. 

GEMARA 
What does he wish to tell us[6]? We have already learnt in the Mishnah : Three who ate together are under the obligation of Zimmun[7]! He means to inform us the same as that which R. Abba said in the name of Samuel : Three who sat down to eat together, although they have not yet partaken of food, are not permitted to separate [before saying Grace]. Another version : R. Abba[1] said in the name of Samuel : This is what he teaches [in our Mishnah] : Three who sat down to eat together, although each partakes of his own loaf, are not permitted to separate [before saying Grace]. Or also [he means to inform us] the same as that which Rab Huna said : Three persons who came together from three parties[2] are not permitted to separate [before saying Grace]. Rab Hisda said : This only applies to those who came together from three different parties, each of which consists of three men[3]. Raba said: This only refers to the case where the original parties [[fol. 50b.]] did not at the outset include these [three men] in their own place for Zimmun[4] ; but if they had done so, then the necessity for Zimmun has passed from these men[5]. Raba said : Whence do I state this? For we have the Mishnaic teaching : A [defiled] couch, half of which has been stolen or lost or has been divided between brothers or partners, becomes clean[6]; but if it is restored, it can from that time onwards contract defilement. From that time onwards it may contract defilement, but not retrospectively[7]. Infer from this that since it has been divided, the defilement has passed from it. So here also[8], since the parties had included these men for Zimmun, it passes from them. 

V. If two parties eat in the same room, etc. 

It has been taught : If there be an attendant between them[9], he unites them [for Zimmun][10]. 

We may not say the benediction over wine. 

Our Rabbis have taught : Until water has been added, we do not say the benediction "...Who createst the fruit of the vine" over the wine, but "...Who createst the fruit of the tree" ; and we may wash the hands therewith[1]. From the time that water has been added, the benediction is "...Who createst the fruit of the vine," and we may not wash the hands therewith. These are the words of R. Eliezer ; but the Sages say : In either case the benediction is "...Who createst the fruit of the vine," and we may not wash the hands therewith. In agreement with whom is that which Samuel said : A man may fulfil all his needs with bread[2]? With whom? With R. Eliezer[3]. R. Jose b. R. Hannina said: The Sages agree with R. Eliezer that over a cup of wine intended for the Grace we do not say the benediction until water is added. What is the reason ? Rab Osha'ya answered : We require a commandment to be performed with the choicest[4]. But what is the use [of undiluted wine] according to the Rabbis? R. Zera said : It may be used for a beverage made of caryota[5]. 

Our Rabbis have taught : Four things are said concerning bread — we may not place raw meat upon bread ; we may not pass a cup full of wine over bread ; we may not throw bread ; we may not rest a dish upon bread[6]. Amemar, Mar Zotra and Rab Ashe dined together, and dates and pomegranates were placed before them. Mar Zotra took [some of the fruit] and threw it before Rab Ashe as his portion. The latter said to him, "Does not the master agree with that which has been taught : One may not throw articles of food?" [He replied], "That refers to bread." "But there is a teaching; Just as one may not throw bread, so one should not throw any article of food!" He replied, "But there is a teaching : Although one may not throw bread, other articles of food may be thrown!" There is, however, no contradiction, one referring to that which becomes repugnant [by throwing], the other to that which does not become repugnant. 

Our Rabbis have taught : We may let wine[1] run through pipes before a bride and bridegroom[2], and throw before them roasted ears of corn and nuts in the Summer[3] but not in Winter; but we may not throw cakes[4] before them in Summer or Winter.  

Rab Judah said : If one forgot and put food into his mouth without a benediction, he should push it on one side [in his mouth] and say the benediction. Another taught: He should swallow it; there is another teaching : He should spit it out ; there is still another teaching : He should push it aside [in his mouth]. There is no contradiction ; the teaching that he should swallow it refers to liquids ; that he should spit it out refers to something that will not become repugnant; and that he should push it on one side refers to something which would become repugnant. But also with [[fol. 51 a.]] something which would not become repugnant let him push it on one side and say the benediction! Rab Isaac Kaskesaah[5] explained [why that is not so] in the presence of R. Jose b. Abin, in the name of R. Johanan[6] : Because it is said, "My mouth shall be filled with Thy praise" (Ps. Ixxi. 8)[7]. 

Rab Hisda was asked : If one has eaten or drunk without having said the benediction[8], may he say it afterwards? He answered : Shall one who has eaten garlic so that the smell is diffused eat more garlic so that its smell be more diffused[9]? Rabina said : Consequently, even if he has finished the meal, he may go back and say the benediction ! For there is a teaching : If one has had immersion and ascended [from the water], as he ascends he should say "Blessed... Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments and commanded us concerning immersion." But the two cases are not parallel; for there [in the instance of immersion], the man was not at the outset fit [to pronounce a benediction][1] ; but here [in the instance of the benediction] the man was fit at the outset [to say it], and since it was deferred it must remain so. 

Our Rabbis have taught : Asparagus-beverage[2] is beneficial for the heart, good for the eyes and how much more so for the digestive organs ; so if one grows addicted to it, it is beneficial for the whole of his body ; but if he becomes intoxicated therewith, it is harmful to his whole body. Since he teaches that it is beneficial for the heart, it is to be inferred that we are here dealing with [a brew] with wine ; and he teaches, "How much more so for the digestive organs." But there is a teaching: For the heart, eye and milt it is beneficial, but injurious to the head, bowels and piles ! The teaching above refers to old wine[3] ; according to the Mishnaic teaching : [If one says] "I vow to abstain from wine because it is injurious to the bowels," and they tell him "But is not old wine beneficial for the bowels ?" and he remains silent, then he is forbidden to drink new wine but is permitted to drink of the old. Draw that inference[4]. 

Our Rabbis have taught : Six things are said of the asparagus-beverage : One should only drink it undiluted and full[5]; one receives it with the right hand but drinks it [holding it] with the left ; one must not talk after drinking it ; one must not stop in the course of drinking ; one must only return the cup to him who handed it to him ; he should expectorate after drinking it ; and one must not support it except with its own kind[6]. But there is a teaching : One should not support it except with bread ! There is no contradiction, the latter referring to [a brew] with wine, the other to [a brew] with beer. One teacher states : For the heart, eyes and milt it is beneficial but injurious to the head, bowels and piles ; whereas there is another teaching : It is beneficial for the head, bowels and piles but injurious to the heart, eyes and milt ! There is no contradiction ; the latter referring to [a brew] with wine, the other to [a brew] with beer. One teacher states : If he expectorates after drinking it he will be smitten [with illness]; and there is another teaching ; If he does not expectorate after drinking it he will be smitten ! There is no contradiction ; the latter referring to [a brew] with wine, the other to [a brew] with beer. Rab Ashe said : Now that thou maintainest that one who does not expectorate after drinking it will be smitten [with illness], the spittle should be emitted even in the presence of a king[1]. 

R. Ishmael b. Elisha[2] said : Three things Suriel[3], the Prince of the Presence, related to me: Do not take thy shirt in the morning from the hand of the attendant and put it on[4]; do not let thy hands be washed by one who has not washed his own ; and do not return the cup of asparagus-beverage except to him who handed it to thee, because a band of demons (another version : a company of angels of destruction) lies in wait for a man, saying, "When will he commit one of these acts and be trapped ?" 

R. Joshua b. Levi said : Three[5] things did the Angel of Death tell me : Do not take thy shirt in the morning from the hand of the attendant and put it on ; do not let thy hands be washed by him who has not washed his own[6]; and do not stand before women when they return from being with a dead person, because I leap and go before them with my sword in my hand[7], and I have permission to destroy. But if one met [such women], what is the remedy? Let him move four cubits from his place ; or if there is a river let him cross it; or if there is another road let him proceed along it ; or if there is a wall let him stand behind it[8] ; but if not, let him turn his face away and say, "And the Lord said unto Satan, The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan" (Zech. iii. 2) until they have passed him by. 

R. Zera said in the name of R. Abbahu (another version: it was taught in a Baraita) : Ten things are said with reference to the cup used for the Grace after meals : It requires washing and rinsing, undiluted [wine] and must be full, crowning and covering[1] ; he takes it with both hands and places it in the right hand, raises it a handbreadth from the floor[2] and gazes at it. Some also say : He sends it as a present to his household[3], R. Johanan said : We only observe four of those rules : washing, rinsing, undiluted [wine] and [the cup] must be full. It has been taught: Washing refers to the inside [of the cup], rinsing to the outside. 

R. Johanan said : Whoever says the benediction over a full cup will be granted a boundless inheritance; as it is said, "And full with the blessing of the Lord ; possess thou the sea and the south" (Deut. xxxiii. 23). R. Jose b. R. Hannina said: He will be worthy to inherit two worlds, this world and the world to come. "Crowning" — Rab Judah used to crown it with disciples[4]. Rab Hisda used to crown it with small cups[5]. R. Hanan said : And with undiluted [wine][6]. Rab Sheshet said : Until the benediction of "the land[7]." "Covering" [the head] — Rab Pappa used to wrap himself [in his Tallit], sit down [and say the Grace][8]. Rab Assi[9] used to spread a cloth over his head. "He takes it with both hands" — R. Hinnana b. Pappa said : What is the Scriptural authority? "Lift up your hands in holiness[10], and bless ye the Lord" (Ps. cxxxiv. 2). "And he places it in his right" — R. Hiyya b. Abba said in the name of R. Johanan : The earlier [Rabbis] asked : May the left hand support the right? Rab Ashe said : Since the earlier [Rabbis] raised this question without having it decided, we must act according to the stricter view[1]. "He raises it a hand- [[fol. 51 b.]] breadth from the floor" — R. Aha b. R. Hannina said[2]: What is the Scriptural authority ? "I will lift up the cup of salvation and call upon the name of the Lord" (Ps. cxvi. 13). "He gazes at it" — so that his thoughts may not wander. "He sends it as a present to his household" — so that his wife may be blessed. 

'Ulla visited the house of Rab Nahman; he wrapped the bread[3] and said Grace and gave the cup of benediction to Rab Nahman. Rab Nahman said to him, "Let the master send the cup of benediction to Jalta[4]." He replied, "Thus spake R. Johanan: The fruit of a woman's body is only blessed through the fruit of a man's body[5]; as it is said, 'He will also bless the fruit of thy body' (Deut. vii. 13) — it is not said 'the fruit of her body' but 'the fruit of thy body'." There is a teaching to the same effect : R. Nathan says : Whence is it that the fruit of a woman's body is only blessed through the fruit of a man's body? As it is said, "He will also bless the fruit of thy body" — it is not said "the fruit of her body" but "the fruit of thy body." Meanwhile Jalta heard [that the cup of benediction had not been sent to her]. She arose in anger, went to the wine-cellar and broke four hundred flasks of wine. Rab Nahman said to him, "Let the master send her another cup." 'Ulla sent it to her [with the message], "All this measure of wine belongs to the benediction[6]." She sent back the reply, "From pedlars comes gossip, from rags come vermin[7]." 

Rab Assi[8] said : One must not speak over the cup of benediction. Rab Assi[8] also said : We may not say the benediction over a cup of ill-luck[9]. What means "a cup of ill-luck"? Rab Nahman b. Isaac said : A second cup[1]. There is a teaching to the same effect : He who drinks [cups of wine] of an even number should not say Grace ; because it is said, "Prepare to meet thy God, O Israel" (Amos iv. 12)[2]; but such an one is not fitly prepared. 

R. Abbahu said (another version : it was taught in a Baraita) : He who eats while walking should say Grace standing ; but he who eats standing should sit to say Grace ; and when he reclines at the meal, he should sit up to say Grace. The Halakah in every case is : He sits and says Grace. 

May we return unto thee : Three who ate !
