MISHNAH I 
[[fol. 86 a.]]

What benediction do we say over fruit ? Over the fruit of trees, one says, "[Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe] Who Createst the fruit of the tree," except over wine ; for over wine ons says, "...Who createst the fruit of the vine." Over the fruits of the earth one says : "... Who createst the fruit of the ground," except over bread; for over bread one says, "...Who bringest forth bread from the earth." Over vegetables one says, "... Who createst the fruit of the ground" ; but R. Judah declares : "... Who createst divers kinds of herbs." 

GEMARA 

Whence is this derived [1]? For our Rabbis have taught: "The fruit thereof shall be holy, for giving praise [hillulim][2] unto the Lord" (Lev. xix. 24) — this teaches that they require a benediction before and after partaking of them. Hence said R. 'Akiba : A man is forbidden to taste anything without previously saying a benediction. 

But is the phrase "holy for giving praise" intended to teach that ? Surely it is required [to teach as follows :] First, that the All-merciful declares [the owner] must redeem it[3] and then eat it ; and second, only those things which require "a song of praise" require redemption, but if they do not require "a song of praise," redemption is unnecessary[4] ! This is according to the statement of R. Samuel b. Nahmani in the name of R. Jonathan who said : Whence is it that we say "a song of praise" only over wine ? As it is said, "And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine which cheereth God and man?" (Judges ix. 13). If it cheereth man, how does it cheer God ? Hence it is to be inferred that we have "a song of praise" only over wine'. 

It is quite right[2] according to him who teaches "the planting of the fourth year[3]"; but according to him who teaches "the vineyard of the fourth year" what is there to say[4]? For it has been reported : R. Hiyya and R. Simeon b. Rabbi [differ] ; one teaches "The vineyard of the fourth year," the other teaches "The planting of the fourth year." According to him who teaches "the vineyard of the fourth year" it is quite right[5] if he argues by analogy of expression[6] ; for there is a teaching : Rabbi says : It is stated here, "That it may yield unto you more richly the increase thereof" (Lev. xix. 25), and it is stated elsewhere, "the increase of the vineyard" (Deut. xxii. 9) — as in the latter passage "increase" refers to the vineyard, so also in the former passage it refers to the vineyard ; and there thus remains over one hillul to be interpreted as meaning that a benediction is required [when partaking of fruits]. But if he does not resort to this argument from analogy, whence does he derive the necessity for a benediction ? And even if he resort to this method of reasoning, we find that a benediction is required after eating[7] ; but whence is it that a benediction is necessary before eating ? This is no difficulty ; for we can use a fortiori reasoning — if he is to bless God when he is satisfied, how much more so when he is hungry[8] ! 

We find this in connection with [the produce of] the vineyard[9]; whence is it [that a benediction is required with] other species ? It can be derived from the instance of the vineyard — as the vineyard, a thing that is enjoyed, requires a benediction, so also everything which is enjoyed requires a benediction. But it is possible to object : Why [is a benediction required with the fruit of] the vineyard ? Because there is the obligation of the gleanings[1]. Let, then, the instance of corn show [whether this point is material][2] ! But why [is a benediction required when partaking of food made from] corn ? Because there is the obligation of Hallah. Then let the instance of the vineyard show [whether this point is material][3]! The argument has therefore to be reinstated[4], because the feature of the first case is not like that of the second and vice versa[5] ; but the factor common to both is that each is something which is enjoyed and consequently requires a benediction. Hence everything which is enjoyed requires a benediction. 

How is this[6] the factor common to them both? [That they are both brought upon] the altar is likewise a common factor[7] ! Then the olive must also be included because it likewise has this factor of [being brought to] the altar ! Does, then, the olive need inclusion because of the factor of the altar ? Behold, the expression kerem "vineyard" is explicitly written in connection therewith ; for it is stated, "And he burnt up the shocks and the standing corn, and also the olive-yards[8]" (Judges xv. 5) ! Rab Pappa answered : It is called "a kerem of olives" but not kerem without qualification. Nevertheless the difficulty remains, "How is this the factor common to them both ? [That they are both brought upon] the altar is likewise a common factor." 

One can, however, derive [the necessity for a benediction] from "the seven species[9]" — as "the seven species" are things enjoyed and require a benediction, so everything that is enjoyed requires a benediction. But why do "the seven species" [require a benediction]? Because they are under the obligation of first-fruits[1]. And further, it is right [that a benediction is necessary] after partaking of them, but whence is it [that a benediction is necessary] before partaking of them ? That is no difficulty ; because it can be derived by a fortiori reasoning — if he says a benediction when satisfied, how much more so when hungry ! According to him who teaches "the planting of the fourth year" it is quite right [that a benediction is required] for everything that is planted; but whence [does he derive the necessity for a benediction] for things not planted, like meat, eggs, fish? It is, however, a generally held opinion that a man is forbidden to enjoy anything of this world without a benediction[2]. 

Our Rabbis have taught : A man is forbidden to enjoy anything of this world without a benediction, and whoever does so commits sacrilege[3]. What is the remedy ? Let him go to a Sage. Let him go to a Sage ! What can he do for him, seeing that he has done what is forbidden ? But, said Raba : [The meaning is,] let him from the first go to a Sage who will teach him the benedictions, so that he should not come to commit sacrilege. 

Rab Judah said in the name of Samuel : Whoever enjoys anything of this world without a benediction is as though he had partaken of the holy things of Heaven ; as it is said, "The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof" (Ps. xxiv. 1). R. Levi asked : It is written, "The earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof," and it is written, "The heavens are the heavens of the Lord, but the earth hath He given to the children of men" (ibid. cxv. 16) ! There is no contradiction ; the former passage referring [[fol. 35 b.]] to before the benediction [has been uttered], the latter to after the benediction. 

R. Hannina b. Pappa said : Whoever enjoys anything of this world without a benediction is as though he robbed the Holy One, blessed be He, and the Community of Israel[1] ; as it is said, "Whoso robbeth his father or his mother and saith, It is no transgression, the same is the companion of a destroyer" (Prov. xxviii, 24) — "father" is none other than the Holy One, blessed be He ; as it is said, "Is not He thy father that hath gotten thee?" (Deut. xxxii. 6) ; and "mother" is none other than the Community of Israel ; as it is said, "Hear, my son, the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the teaching of thy mother" (Prov. i. 8). What means "the companion of a destroyer" ? R. Hannina b, Pappa said : He is the companion of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who corrupted Israel against their Father in Heaven. 

R. Hannina b. Pappa asked : It is written, "Therefore will I take back My corn in the time thereof" etc. (Hosea ii. 11), and it is written, "And thou shalt gather in thy corn" etc. (Deut. xi. 14) ! There is no contradiction; the latter referring to the time when Israel perform the will of the All-present, the former to when Israel neglect His will. 

Our Rabbis have taught : "And thou shalt gather in thy corn" — what has this teaching to tell us ? Since it is written, "This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth [but thou shalt meditate therein day and night]" (Josh. i. 8), it is possible to think that these words [are to be understood] as they are written[2]; therefore there is a teaching to say, "And thou shalt gather in thy corn," ie. conduct at the same time a worldly occupation. These are the words of R. Ishmael. R. Simeon b. Johai says : Is it possible for a man to plough at the time of ploughing, sow at seed-time, reap at harvest-time, thresh at the time of threshing, and winnow at the time of wind[3] — what is to become of Torah? But when Israel perform the will of the All-present, their work is done by others; as it is said, "And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks," etc. (Is. Ixi. 5) ; and at the time when Israel perform not the will of the All-present, their work has to be done by themselves ; as it is said, "And thou shalt gather in thy corn." Not that alone, but the work of others will be done by them ; as it is said, "And thou shalt serve thine enemy" etc. (Deut. xxviii. 48). Abbai said : Many acted in accord with the teaching of R. Ishmael[1] and it proved efficacious ; but he who acted in accord with R. Simeon b. Johai did not find it so. Raba said to the Rabbis : I beg of you not to appear before me during the days of Nisan and Tishri[2], so that you may not be concerned about your maintenance the whole year. 

Rabbah b. Bar Hannah stated that R. Johanan said in the name of R. Judah b. R. El'ai[3] : Come and see that the later generations are not like the former generations. The former generations made their Torah their principal concern and their work only occasional, and both flourished in their hand ; whereas the later generations made their work their principal concern and their Torah only occasional and neither flourished in their hand. 

Rabbah b. Bar Hannah also stated that R. Johanan said in the name of R. Judah b. R. El'ai : Come and see that the later generations are not like the former generations. The former generations used to bring their fruits home by way of the kitchen-garden[4] in order to make them liable to the tithe ; whereas the later generations bring their fruits home by way of the roof, or courts, or enclosures in order to exempt them from the tithe. For R. Jannai has said : Produce is not subject to the tithe until it sees the face of the house ; as it is said, "I have put away the hallowed things out of my house" (Deut. xxvi. 13). R. Johanan said : Even [if it see] a fixed court [it is subject to the tithe] ; as it is said, "That they may eat within thy gates and be satisfied" (ibid. v. 12). 

Except over wine, etc. 

Why is wine different ? Should one say because it is changed [from the grape] into something higher [in value], therefore there is a change in the benediction, but lo, oil which is changed [from the olive] into something higher [in value] has no alteration in the benediction ; for Rab Judah said in the name of Samuel, and similarly said R. Isaac in the name of R. Johanan : Over olive-oil we pronounce the benediction "...Who createst the fruit of the tree" ! The answer is : In this case [of oil, the benediction is unaltered] because none other is possible. What other benediction could he say? Should he use the formula "...Who createst the fruit of the olive," the olive itself is called "fruit[1]"! Then let him say "...Who createst the fruit of the olive-tree[2]." But said Mar Zotra : Wine nourishes, oil does not. Oil does not nourish ? Lo, there is a Mishnaic teaching : He who vows [to abstain] from food may partake of water and salt ! And we argue that water and salt are not called "food," but everything else is so called ; and we further say that this is a refutation of Rab and Samuel who maintain that we pronounce the benediction "...Who createst various kinds of food" only over the five species[3]. Moreover Rab Huna said : [The quoted Mishnah means,] Whoever declares "Everything that nourishes [I forbid] myself" — hence conclude that oil does nourish[4] ! But wine satisfies and oil does not. Does wine satisfy? Lo, Raba used to drink wine the whole of the day preceding Passover to whet his appetite in order to eat the unleavened bread with greater zest ! A large quantity whets the appetite, but a little satisfies [hunger]. But does it satisfy at all? For lo, it is written, "And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, making the face brighter than oil, and bread that stayeth man's heart" (Ps. civ. 15) — it is bread, not wine, that is a stay! Nay, wine does both, it satisfies and makes glad, whereas bread is only a stay, but does not cheer. If so, let him utter three benedictions[5] ! But men do not fix their meals for its sake[6]. Rab Nahman b. Isaac[7] asked Raba : How is it if a man did fix his meal on its account[8]? He replied : When Elijah[9] comes, let him say whether such can be fixed for a meal ; at present, at least, such a thought does not exist amongst men[10]. 

It was stated above : "Rab Judah said in the name of Samuel, and similarly said R. Isaac in the name of R. Johanan : Over olive-oil we pronounce the benediction '...Who createst the fruit of the tree'." How is this meant[1]? Should I say that he drinks it as a beverage, it does him harm[2]; for there is a teaching : He who drinks the oil of an offering repays its value but not a fifth in addition ; but he who anoints himself with the oil of an offering repays its value plus a fifth[3]! But [perhaps it is here meant that] he eats it together with bread. If so, the bread is the principal food and the oil is only accessory ; and we have the Mishnaic teaching : This is the general rule : In the case of a food which is the principal thing and together with it something accessory, the benediction is to be uttered over the former, and there is no necessity for a benediction over the latter ! But [perhaps what is meant is] he drinks it with elaiogaron[4]. (Rabbah b, Samuel said[5] : [[fol. 36 a.]] Elaiogaron is the juice of beets ; oxygaron is the juice of all other kinds of boiled vegetables.) If so, the elaiogaron is the principal thing and the oil an accessory ; and we have the Mishnaic teaching : This is the general rule : In the case of a food which is the principal thing and together with it is something accessory, the benediction is to be uttered over the former, and there is no necessity for a benediction over the latter ! With what are we here dealing [6]? With the case of one who has a sore throat[7]; for there is a teaching : One suffering from a sore throat may not directly mollify it with oil on the Sabbath, but he should put a large quantity of oil into an elaiogaron and swallow it. This is evident[8]! But shouldest thou imagine that because he intends it as a cure no benediction at all is necessary, therefore it informs us that since he derives enjoyment from it, he is required to pronounce a benediction[9]. 

Over wheaten-flour, Rab Judah says : [The benediction is] "...Who createst the fruit of the ground." Rab Nahman said : It is "...By Whose word all things exists[1]." Raba said to Rab Nahman : Thou shouldest not differ from Rab Judah, because R. Johanan and Samuel agree with him ; for Rab Judah said in the name of Samuel, and similarly said R. Isaac in the name of R. Johanan : We pronounce over olive-oil the benediction "... Who createst the fruit of the tree" — hence infer that although it has undergone change[2], it still remains essentially the same[3]; and like-wise here [with wheaten-flour] although it has undergone change, it still remains essentially the same[4]. Are, however, the two cases analogous ? There [with oil], it has not another and higher value ; but here it has by being made into bread ! But if [the wheaten-flour] have another and higher value, should we no longer use the benediction "...Who createst the fruit of the ground," but say instead "...By Whose word all things exist"? And lo, R. Zera said in the name of Rab Mattena in the name of Samuel : Over raw cabbage and barley-flour we use the benediction "...By Whose word all things exist"; is it not then to be supposed that wheaten-flour requires the benediction "...Who createst the fruit of the ground[5]"? No; wheaten-flour also requires "...By Whose word all things exist." Then he should have specified wheaten-flour, and [we could have argued for ourselves] how much more so barley-flour[6]! If he had specified wheaten-flour, I might have thought that it applies only to wheat, but barley requires no benediction at all ; therefore he mentioned it for us. Is, then, [barley-flour] of less value than salt and brine[7]? For there is a teaching[8]: Over salt and brine one says "...By Whose word all things exist." It was necessary[9] ; for otherwise it might have entered thy mind to item, the rest being accessory; conseqnently it is established that there is a circumstance where oil requires a benediction. 

say that salt or brine a man is accustomed to convey to his mouth [with his food, and therefore a benediction is required], but since barley-flour is injurious by creating tape-worms no benediction should be uttered at all ; therefore he teaches us that since there is some enjoyment therefrom, it is necessary to pronounce a benediction. 

Over the palm-heart[1], Rab Judah said: [The benediction is] "...Who createst the fruit of the ground" ; but Samuel said : It is "...By Whose word all things exist." Rab Judah said : It is "...Who Greatest the fruit of the ground" because it is fruit. Samuel said : It is "...By Whose word all things exist" because in the end it hardens[2]. Samuel said to Rab Judah : Thou keen-witted one[3]! Thy opinion is correct: because over the radish, though it in the end grows hard, we say "...Who createst the fruit of the ground." But it is not so[4] ! For people plant radishes for the sake of the tuber, but people do not plant palms for the sake of the heart[5] ! Is it, then, [to be assumed] that in every case where men do not plant specifically to obtain that article of food, we do not pronounce the benediction[6] over it? Lo, the caper-bush men plant for the purpose of the caper-blossom ; and we have a Mishnaic teaching : In the case of the various kinds of capers, over the leaves and young shoots one says "...Who createst the fruit of the ground," but over the berries and buds[7] "...Who createst the fruit of the tree[8]" ! Rab Nahman b. Isaac said : Men do plant caper-bushes for the sake of the shoots, but not the palm for the sake of the heart ; and although Samuel praised Rab Judah[9], the Halakah is in agreement with Samuel. 

Rab Judah said in the name of Rab : As for the caper-bush which is still in a state of 'Orlah outside the [Holy] Land, one throws away the berries but eats the buds ; that is to say, the berries are fruit[1] but not the buds. Against this [deduction] I quote : ln the case of the various kinds of capers, over the leaves and their young shoots one says "...Who createst the fruit of the ground," but over the berries and buds "...Who createst the fruit of the tree[2]!" He[3] speaks according to the view of R. 'Akiba ; for there is a Mishnaic teaching : R. Eliezer[4] says : In the case of the caper-bush, we give tithe of the young shoots and the berries and buds ; R. 'Akiba says : We only give tithe of the berries because they are fruit[5]. Then let him say that the Halakah is in agreement with R. 'Akiba[6]! If he had said that the Halakah is in agreement with R. 'Akiba, I might have thought that [that is so] even in the Land of Israel ; therefore he informs us : Whoever takes a lenient view within the Land, the Halakah is in accord with him outside the Land, but not within. Then let him say : The Halakah is in agreement with R. 'Akiba outside the Land; for everyone who takes the lenient view within the Land[7], the Halakah is in accord with him outside the Land ! If he had stated that, I might have said : This applies to the tithe of trees which within the Land is a Rabbinical ordinance ; but with regard to 'Orlah, which within the Land is ordained by the Torah, I must suppose that likewise outside the Land we must apply it ! Therefore he informs us[8]. 

Rabina found Mar b. Rab Ashe throwing away the berries and eating the caper-buds[9]. He said to him : What is thy opinion — like R. 'Akiba's who takes the lenient view[10]? Then let the master act in accord with Bet Shammai who take a still more lenient view[11]. For there is a Mishnaic teaching : In the case of the caper-bush. Bet Shammai say : It constitutes Kila'im in a vineyard ; but Bet Hillel say : It does not. Both, however, admit that it is subject to 'Orlah. This is self-contradictory ! Thou declarest, "In the case of the caper-bush, Bet Shammai say : It constitutes Kila'im in a vineyard" — hence it is a kind of vegetable[1] ! It then goes on to state, "Both, however, admit that it is subject to 'Orlah" — hence it is a kind of tree[2]! There is no contradiction; for Bet Shammai, being in doubt[3], take the stricter view in both cases[4]. Nevertheless[5] Bet Shammai have a doubt whether it is subject to 'Orlah; and we have a Mishnaic teaching: Where there is a doubt [whether a thing is subject to] 'Orlah — in the Land of Israel it is prohibited [to be used][6], in Syria it is permitted, [[fol. 86 b.]] and outside the Land one may go down and buy it, but he must not see the man gathering it [from the bushes][7]. When R. 'Akiba is in opposition to R. Eliezer, we act according to his view[8]; but when Bet Shammai are in opposition to Bet Hillel, [the opinion of the former] is not Mishnah[9]. 

Thou mayest, however, derive [a conclusion][10] from the fact that [the bud] constitutes a protection of the fruit, and the All-merciful declared, "Ye shall deem it an uncircumcision with its fruit[11]" (Lev. xix. 23) — the word "with" meaning to include what is attached to the fruit ; and what is that ? The protection of the fruit[12]. Raba replied : When do we declare a thing to be the protection of the fruit ? When it is so either plucked or attached [to the tree] ; but here [the bud is only a protection] when attached, but not when plucked[13]. Abbai quoted in objection: The top-piece of a pomegranate is reckoned in[14] but not the blossom[1]; and since it is stated that the blossom is not reckoned in, conclude that it is not food. And we have a Mishnaic teaching with reference to 'Orlah : The skins of the pomegranate and its blossom, and the shells of nuts and the kernels are subject to 'Orlah[2] ! But, said Raba : When do we declare that a thing constitutes the protection of the fruit ? When it is there at the time the fruit has ripened ; but the caper-bud is not there at the time the fruit has ripened[3]. But it is not so[4] ! For Rab Nahman has said in the name of Rabbah b. Abbuha : The calyces surrounding dates are forbidden because of 'Orlah, since they are the protection of the fruit ; and when are they the protection of the fruit? In the early stages [of the fruit's growth], then are they called the protection of the fruit ! Rab Nahman holds the same view as R. Jose ; for there is a Mishnaic teaching : R. Jose said : The grape-bud is forbidden[5] because it is fruit ; but the Rabbis differ from him[6]. Rab Shimi[7] of Nehardea[8] asked : But do the Rabbis differ from him in the case of other trees[9]? For lo, there is a Mishnaic teaching : From what time must we cease cutting down the trees in the seventh year[10]? Bet Shammai say : All trees, as soon as they produce fruit. Bet Hillel say : Carobtrees when they begin to form chains, vines when they form globules, olive-trees when they bloom, and all other trees when they produce fruit. And Rab Assi[11] said : Boser and Garua' and the white bean are the same[12]. [The same as] the white bean, dost thou imagine ? Nay, the meaning is : The size [of Boser and Garua'] is like that of the white bean. Whom hast thou heard declaring that the Boser is [to be considered fruit] but not the grape-bud? The Rabbis[13]. It states : "All other trees when they produce fruit." But, said Raba: When do we say a thing is the protection of the fruit? When, if the protection is removed, the fruit perishes ; but here [in the case of the caper] the fruit does not perish if the protecting [bud] is removed. The experiment was made ; they removed the blossom of the pomegranate and the fruit withered ; they removed the flower of the caper but the caper survived[1]. The Halakah is according to Mar b. Rab Ashe who threw away the berries and ate the buds ; and since these are not regarded as fruit for the purpose of 'Orlah, they are likewise not so regarded for the purpose of the benediction. We accordingly utter over them not "...Who createst the fruit of the tree" but "...Who createst the fruit of the ground." 

Over pepper, Rab Sheshet said: [The benediction is] "...By Whose word all things exist" ; Raba said : None at all [is required][2]. Raba is consistent with his opinion [expressed elsewhere] ; for he has said : If one chews pepper-corns on the Day of Atonement he is free [from guilt][3]; if he chews ginger on the Day of Atonement he is likewise free. It is quoted in objection : R. Meir has declared : From the statement of Scripture, "Ye shall deem it an uncircumcision with its fruit" (Lev. xix. 23), do I not know that a food-bearing tree is intended ? Why, then, is there a teaching to tell us "trees for food" (ibid.)? To include a tree whose wood and fruit taste alike. And which is that? Pepper ; to teach thee that pepper is subject to 'Orlah[4], and to teach thee that the Land of Israel lacks nothing ; as it is said, "A land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any thing in it" (Deut. viii. 9)! There is no contradiction[5] ; the latter refers to moist [pepper][6], the other to dried. The Rabbis[7] said to Maremar : He who chews ginger on the Day of Atonement is free [from guilt]. But lo, Raba declared : The preserved ginger which comes from India is permitted[8], and we pronounce the benediction "...Who createst the fruit of the ground" over it[9]! There is no contradiction; the latter referring to moist [ginger], the other to dried. 

Over Habis[1] boiled in a pot and also pounded grain, Rab Judah said : [The benediction is] "...By Whose word all things exist" ; Rab Kahana said : It is "...Who createst various kinds of food." With plain pounded grain[2] all agree that "...Who createst all kinds of foods" is the correct benediction, the disagreement arising in connection with pounded grain made like a boiled Habis. Rab Judah maintained [that the benediction should be] "...By Whose word all things exist," being of the opinion that the honey is the principal ingredient ; whereas Rab Kahana maintained it is "...Who createst various kinds of foods," holding that the flour is the principal ingredient. Rab Joseph said : The view of Rab Kahana seems more probable, because Rab and Samuel both say that a dish which contains one of the five species[2] requires the benediction "...Who createst various kinds of foods." 

It has just been mentioned : "Rab and Samuel both say : A dish which contains one of the five species requires the benediction '...Who createst various kinds of foods'." It has likewise been reported : Rab and Samuel both say: A dish which is of the five species requires the benediction "...Who createst various kinds of foods." It was necessary [to give both these statements]. If we had been taught only the second, I might have said that [that benediction is required] because the dish has the appearance [of one of the five species], but not if mixed with other ingredients ; therefore we are informed that a dish which [[fol. 37 a.]] contains it [requires that benediction]. If, on the other hand, we had been taught only the first, I might have said a dish containing any of the five species does [require that benediction], but not rice or millet because these are mixed with other ingredients. Should, however, it have the appearance [of one of the five species], we might say that even with rice or millet we pronounce the benediction "...Who createst various kinds of foods"; therefore we are informed, "A dish which is of the five species requires the benediction '...Who createst various kinds of foods'," to the exclusion of rice and millet ; for even if it retain its appearance we do not say that benediction. 

And over rice and millet do we not bless "...Who createst various kinds of foods"? Lo, there is a teaching : If they brought before a man bread of rice or of millet, he pronounces a benediction before and after as with any other cooked dish. And with reference to a cooked dish there is a teaching : Before partaking thereof one should bless "...Who createst various kinds of foods" and after it one benediction which is an abstract of three[1]! [Bread of rice or of millet] is like a cooked dish [in one respect] but unlike a cooked dish [in another]. It is like a cooked dish in so far as there is a benediction before and after partaking thereof. But it is unlike a cooked dish; for over a cooked dish one says at first "...Who createst various kinds of foods," and in the end one benediction which is an abstract of three. [With rice and millet], however, one first says "...By Whose word all things exist" and in the end "...Who createst many living beings with their wants," etc.[2]
 
Is not rice a cooked dish[3]? And lo, there is a teaching ; The following are cooked dishes[3] : grist, groats, fine flour, split grain, barley-meal and rice! Who said this? R. Johanan b. Nuri ; for there is a teaching : R. Johanan b. Nuri says : Rice is a species of corn[3], and through its fermentation [during Passover] one incurs the penalty of excision[4]; but a man can comply with the requirements of the law therewith during Passover[5]. The Rabbis, however, do not agree with him. Do they not? Lo, there is a teaching : He who chews wheat should say the benediction "...Who createst the fruit of the ground"; if he ground it, baked and then boiled it, should the pieces of bread be still whole, before partaking thereof he says "...Who bringest forth bread from the earth[6]" and afterwards he says the three benedictions[7]; but if the pieces are no longer whole[8], he first says "...Who createst various kinds of foods" and afterwards one benediction which is an abstract of three. He who chews rice says the benediction "...Who createst the fruit of the ground"; if he ground it, baked and then boiled it, although the pieces are still whole, he first says "...Who createst various kinds of foods" and afterwards one benediction which is an abstract of three. According to whom [is this teaching]? If I say it is R. Johanan b. Nuri who declared "Rice is a kind of corn," then one should say "...Who bringest forth bread from the earth" and the three benedictions[1]! Must it not be the Rabbis[2]? This is a refutation of Rab and Samuel[3], and it remains unanswered. 

The teacher stated : "He who chews wheat should say the benediction '...Who createst the fruit of the ground'." But there is a teaching: [He should say] "...Who createst divers kinds of seeds"![4] There is no contradiction; the latter being the opinion of R. Judah[5], the other of the Rabbis. For our Mishnah teaches : Over vegetables one says : "...Who createst the fruit of the ground" ; but R. Judah declares: "...Who createst divers kinds of herbs." 

The teacher stated : "He who chews rice says the benediction '...Who createst the fruit of the ground'; if he ground it, baked and then boiled it, although the pieces are still whole, he first says '...Who createst various kinds of foods' and afterwards one benediction which is an abstract of three." But there is a teaching: After partaking thereof no benediction is required ! Rab Sheshet said : There is no contradiction : one being the opinion of Rabban Gamaliel, the other of the Rabbis. For there is a teaching : This is the general rule — Any food which belongs to the seven species[6], Rabban Gamaliel says : Three benedictions [are required after partaking thereof], whereas the Rabbis say : One benediction which is an abstract of three. 

It once happened that Rabban Gamaliel[7] and the Elders were reclining in an upper chamber in Jericho ; dates were set before them and they ate. Rabban Gamaliel gave permission to R. 'Akiba to say Grace[8]. R. 'Akiba sat up and said one benediction which is an abstract of three. Rabban Gamaliel said to him, "'Akiba, how long wilt thou put thy head between strife!" He replied, "Our master ! Although thou sayest thus and thy colleagues say otherwise, thou hast taught us, our master, that where the individual and the many differ, the Halakah is in accord with the view of the many ! " 

R. Judah said in his name[1] : Any food which belongs to the seven species and is not a kind of corn, or if a kind of corn it has not been made into bread, Rabban Gamaliel declares three benedictions [are required after partaking thereof], but the Sages [[fol. 37 b.]] declare: Only one benediction[2]. And any food which does not belong to the seven species and is not a kind of corn, for instance, bread of rice or millet, Rabban Gamaliel declares: One benediction which is an abstract of three, but the Sages declare : None at all. According to whom, then, dost thou confirm [the teaching: After partaking of rice one benediction which is an abstract of three is necessary] ? According to Rabban Gamaliel. I will quote the latter part of the first teaching, viz. : "If the pieces are no longer whole, he first says '...Who createst various kinds of foods' and afterwards one benediction which is an abstract of three." Whose teaching is this ? If Rabban Gamaliel's, since he has just declared that for dates and pounded grain [3] three benedictions are necessary, how much more necessary should they be if the pieces are no longer whole[4]! Nay, it is evident that it must be the Rabbis'[5]. If so, the Rabbis contradict themselves[6]! But it is certainly the view of the Rabbis ; and with reference to rice the teaching is: After partaking thereof no benediction is required[7]. 

Raba said : Over the Rihata[8] of the field labourers which contains a large admixture of flour, the benediction is "...Who createst various kinds of food." Why? Because the flour is the principal ingredient. [Over the Rihata] of townspeople which does not contain so much flour, the benediction is "...By Whose word all things exist." Why? Because honey is the principal ingredient. Raba afterwards said : Over both kinds the benediction is "...Who createst various kinds of foods"; because Rab and Samuel both declare : Over any food which contains one of the five species, the benediction is "...Who createst various kinds of foods." 

Rab Joseph said : Over the Habis which contains pieces of bread the size of an olive, before partaking thereof the benediction is "...Who bringest forth bread from the earth," and afterwards three benedictions. If it does not contain pieces of bread the size of an olive, before partaking thereof the benediction is "...Who createst various kinds of foods" and afterwards one benediction which is an abstract of three. Rab Joseph said : Whence have I this' ? There is a teaching: If one[2] were standing and bringing meal-offerings in Jerusalem, he says "Blessed [art Thou, O Lord our Grod, King of the universe], Who has kept us in life, and hast preserved us, and enabled us to reach this season." If he[3] takes them to eat, he says the benediction "...Who bringest forth bread from the earth"; and it is taught in this connection : They must all be broken into pieces[4] about the size of an olive. Abbai said to him : But according to the Tanna of the school of R. Ishmael who declared, "He must crumble [the meal-offerings] until they return to the condition of flour [before eating thereof]," it would then be unnecessary to pronounce the benediction "...Who bringest forth bread from the earth[5]." And if thou sayest that is so[6], lo there is a teaching : If he gathered together from all of them[7] about the size of an olive and ate them, should it be leaven he incurs the penalty of excision[8], and if unleaven, a man can therewith comply with the requirements of the law during Passover[9]! With what are we here dealing? When he rekneaded the crumbs into a compact mass[1]. In that case, I shall quote the latter part of the Baraita: That is, only if he eats them the time it takes to eat half [a roll][2]. But if he rekneaded them, it should have stated "he eats it" not "he eats them"! With what are we here dealing ? When [the crumbs] are from a whole[3] loaf. How is it then in this matter? Rab Sheshet said : Over Habis, although it does not contain pieces of bread the size of an olive, he blesses "...Who bringest forth bread from the earth." Raba said : This is only so if it has the semblance of bread. 

Troknin[4] is subject to Hallah. When Rabin came, R. Johanan said: It is exempt from Hallah. What is Troknin ? Abbai[5] said : Dough baked in a cavity made in the ground. 

Abbai also said : Tarita is exempt from [6] Hallah. What is Tarita? Some say : A scalded puff-pastry. Others declare it to be Indian bread[7]. Yet others declare it to be bread made into Kuttah[8]. R. Hiyya taught : Bread made into Kuttah is exempt from Hallah. But there is a teaching ; It is subject to Hallah ! Yes, but there it mentions the reason, viz. : R. Judah says : The way they are [[fol. 38a.]] made decides[9]. If he made them into cakes[10], they are subject [to Hallah]; but if he made them into "shingles[11]," they are exempt. Abbai asked Rab Joseph : Which benediction is to be said over dough baked in a cavity made in the ground ? He said to him : Dost thou consider it to be bread ? It is only a thick mass, and the benediction is "...Who createst various kinds of foods." Mar Zotra made a meal of it and said the benediction "...Who bringest forth bread from the earth" and [afterwards] the three benedictions[1]. Mar b. Rab Ashe said : A man can comply with the requirements of the law therewith on the Passover. On what ground ? We may apply to it the term "bread of affliction" (Deut. xvi. 3). 

Mar b. Rab Ashe also said : Over the honey of the date-palm we use the benediction "...By Whose word all things exist[2]." What is the reason ? Because it is only the moisture [of the tree]. According to whom is this ? According to the Tanna of the following Mishnaic teaching : In the case of the honey of the date-palm, cider, the vinegar of winter-grapes[3] and other fruit-juices which are brought as an offering, [if a non-priest in error partake thereof] R. Eliezer condemns him to pay the value plus a fifth[4]; but R. Joshua exempts him[5]. 

One of the Rabbis asked Raba : How is it with Trimma[6] ? Raba was not sure what he had asked him. Rabina was sitting in the presence of Raba and said [to the questioner] : Dost thou mean a brew of sesame seeds, or of saffron, or of grape-kernels ? In the meantime Raba recalled it[7] and he said to him : Thou must surely mean a brew of ground dates ; and thou remindest me of something that R. Assi said, viz. : It is permissible to make Trimma from dates brought as an offering, but one must not make strong drink of them. And the Halakah is : Over dates made into Trimma we say the benediction "...Who createst the fruit of the tree." On what ground ? Because [the dates are considered] as remaining in their original condition [as fruit]. 

Over Shattit[8] Rab said : [The benediction is] "...By Whose word all things exist"; Samuel said: It is "...Who createst various kinds of foods." Rab Hisda said : There is no difference of opinion between them ; the latter referring to a thick mass, the other to a thin mass. The thick mass is used as food, the thin as a remedy. 

Rab Joseph[1] quoted in objection : "[R. Judah and R. Jose] both hold that we may stir up a Shattit on the Sabbath and drink Egyptian beer[2]" ! If, then, thou thinkest that [the Shattit] is intended as a remedy, is it permitted to compound a remedy on the Sabbath ? Abbai said to him : Art thou not of the opinion [that it is permitted to compound a remedy on the Sabbath] ? Lo, there is a Mishnaic teaching : All foods may be eaten as a remedy, and likewise all liquids may be drunk ! What is there for thee to say[3]? The man intended it as a food [and therefore it may be prepared on the Sabbath] ; so here also [in the case of the Shattit] the man intended it as a food. (Another version is : What is there for thee to say? The man intended it as a food, and it became a remedy of itself ; so here also [the Shattit] was intended as a food, and it became a remedy of itself[4].) 

It was necessary to have the statements of Rab and Samuel[5]. For from that [quotation from the Mishnah] I might have said that [only when the Shattit] is intended as a food and becomes a remedy of itself [is a benediction required] ; but here, since it was from the outset intended as a remedy, no benediction is at all required[6]. Therefore [from Rab and Samuel's statement] we are informed that since one derives enjoyment therefrom, it is necessary to say a benediction. 

For over bread one says : "... Who bringest forth bread from the earth." 

Our Rabbis have taught : What does he say ? "...Who bringest forth [hammosi'] bread from the earth." R. Nehemiah stated : It is "...Who brought forth [mosi'][7] bread from the earth." Raba said : Nobody disagrees about mosi that it has the meaning "brought forth" ; as it is said, "God Who brought them forth [mosiam][8] out of Egypt" (Num. xxiii. 22). In what do they differ? In the word hammosi'. The Rabbis hold that hammosi' means "Who brought forth," for it is written "Who brought thee forth [hammosi'] water out of the rock of flint" (Deut. viii. 15) ; and R. Nehemiah holds it means "Who bringeth forth," as it is said, "Who bringeth you out [hammosi'] from under the burden of the Egyptians" (Exod. vi. 7). The Rabbis explain this verse as follows : Thus spake the Holy One, blessed be He, to Israel, "When I bring you forth, I will do that for you whereby you may know that I am He that brought you forth[1] from Egypt; for it is written 'And ye shall know that I am the Lord your God Who brought you out [hammosi']'" (ibid.). 

The Rabbis praised Rab Zebid the father of R. Simeon b. Rab Zebid to R. Zera[2] as being a great man and expert in the benedictions. R. Zera said to them, "Should he come to you bring him to me." On one occasion Rab Zebid paid him a visit. He was handed some bread, and began the benediction [using the word] mosi'. R. Zera exclaimed, "Is this he of whom they declare he is a great man and expert in the benedictions ! It would have been right if he had said hammosi'; then he would have informed [[fol. 38 b.]] us of the explanation[3] and also intimated that the Halakah is in accord with the Rabbis. But since he said mosi', what does he wish us to infer?" But Rab Zebid acted thus to exclude himself from the divergence of opinion, the Halakah being in agreement with the Rabbis, viz. : hammosi', for it is established in accord with the Rabbis who declare the word to mean "Who brought forth[4]." 

Over vegetables one says : "...Who createst the fruit of the ground" ; but R. Judah declares : "... Who createst divers kinds of herbs." 

He teaches that vegetables resemble bread [in this respect] : as bread is changed by the fire [in appearance, but the benediction remains unaltered], so also are vegetables changed by the fire [but the benediction is the same]. Rabbanai[5] said in the name of Abbai : This means that the benediction over boiled vegetables is "...Who createst the fruit of the ground." (From whence is this derived ? Since he taught that vegetables resemble bread[1].) 

Rab Hisda expounded in the name of our teacher — and who is he? Rab: Over boiled vegetables we pronounce the benediction "...Who createst the fruit of the ground" ; but our teachers who came down from the land of Israel [to Babylon] — and who are they ? 'Ulla in the name of R. Johanan — said : Over boiled vegetables we pronounce the benediction "...By Whose word all things exist." I[2] say that any article of food which in its original state[3] requires "...Who createst the fruit of the ground," if cooked requires "...By Whose word all things exist" ; and whatever in its original state[4] requires "...By Whose word all things exist," if cooked requires "...Who createst the fruit of the ground." It is quite right that food which in its original state requires "...By Whose word all things exist," if cooked requires "...Who createst the fruit of the ground" ; for it is found thus in the instances of cabbage, beet and the pumpkin. But something which in its original state requires "...Who createst the fruit of the ground," if cooked requires "...By Whose word all things exist" — where is such to be found ? Rab Nahman b. Isaac said : There are the instances of garlic and leek. 

Rab Nahman expounded in the name of our teacher — and who is he? Samuel : Over boiled vegetables we pronounce the benediction "...Who createst the fruit of the ground"; but our colleagues who came down from the land of Israel — and who are they ? 'Ulla in the name of R. Johanan — said : Over boiled vegetables the benediction is "... By Whose word all things exist." I say that [their difference of opinion] is taught in the following controversy; for there is a teaching : One complies with the requirements of the law[5] with a wafer which has been soaked or cooked, provided it has not dissolved. These are the words of R. Meir[6] ; but R. Jose says : One complies with the requirements of the law with a wafer which has been soaked, but not with one which has been cooked even if it has not dissolved[7]. It is not so ; for it is agreed by all that over boiled vegetables the benediction is "...Who createst the fruit of the ground[1]" ; and only in this case[2] does R. Jose say so because we require the taste of the unleavened bread, and it is not there [if the wafer is cooked]. Hence, however, even R. Jose admits it[3]. 

R. Hiyya b. Abba said in the name of R. Johanan : Over boiled vegetables we pronounce the benediction "...Who createst the fruit of the ground." But R. Benjamin b. Jephet said in the name of R. Johanan: Over boiled vegetables the benediction is "...By Whose word all things exist." Rab Nahman b. Isaac said : 'Ulla confirmed this error according to R. Benjamin b. Jephet[4]. R. Zera asked in astonishment : What has the statement of R. Benjamin b. Jephet to do by the side of that of R. Hiyya b. Abba[5] ! R. Hiyya b. Abba paid careful attention and learnt the teaching from R. Johanan his master, but R. Benjamin b. Jephet was not so attentive. Also, R. Hiyya b.Abba used to revise his study in the presence of R. Johanan his master every thirty days, but R. Benjamin b. Jephet did not do so. Besides, apart from these two reasons[6], there is the incident when lupines were cooked seven times in a pot and eaten as a dessert ; they came and questioned R. Johanan[7], and he replied, "...Who createst the fruit of the ground[8]." And R. Hiyya b. Abba likewise said : I saw R. Johanan eat a salted[9] olive, and he pronounced a benediction before and after. This is quite right if thou maintainest that food when cooked is to be regarded as remaining the same ; then, before partaking [of the salted olive] the benediction is "...Who createst the fruit of the tree," and afterwards he says one benediction which is an abstract of three. Shouldest thou, however, maintain that cooked food is not to be regarded as remaining the same, it is right that before partaking thereof one should say "...By Whose word all things exist" ; but what benediction is to be said afterwards ? Perhaps "...Who createst many living beings with their wants" etc.[1] Rab Isaac b. Samuel[2] quoted in objection : In the case of herbs wherewith one complies with the requirements of the law on Passover, they or their stalk are legitimate, but not if they have been pickled or cooked or sodden ! If thou thinkest they are to be regarded as remaining the same, why not when [these herbs are cooked] ? There it is different ; because we require the taste of the bitter herbs[3] and it is not there [if they are cooked]. 

R. Jeremiah asked R. Zera, "How could R. Johanan pronounce a benediction over a salted olive since, if the stone had been removed, the minimum quantity is wanting[4]?" He replied, "Dost thou think that the quantity equivalent to a large olive is necessary [to constitute the minimum] ? About the size of an average [[fol. 39 a.]] olive is sufficient ; and there was that quantity, because the olive which they brought to R. Johanan was of a large size, so that although the stone was removed, the minimum still remained." For there is a Mishnaic teaching : The olive which they mention [as constituting the minimum] is neither small nor large but an average size, viz. : the kind called Egori[5]. R. Abbahu said : Its name is not Egori but Ibroti[6]; and some say Simrosi[7]. Why is it called Egori ? Because its oil is stored up [agur] within it. 

We can say that this is like [the discussion of] the Tannaim. For two disciples were sitting in the presence of Bar Kappara, When there were set before him cabbage, Damascene plums and poultry. Bar Kappara gave one of the disciples permission to say the benediction. He sat up and said the benediction over the poultry. His companion laughed at him, and Bar Kappara became angry, saying, "Not with him who uttered the benediction, but with him who laughed, am I angry. If thy companion is like one who has never tasted meat[1], wherefore dost thou laugh at him?" Then he said, "Not with him who laughed am I angry, but with him who uttered the benediction" ; and he continued, "If there is no wisdom here, is there no old age here[2]?" It has been taught that both of them did not survive that year[3]. Is it not that they differed in the following point : He who said the benediction thought that for cooked vegetables and poultry it is "...By Whose word all things exist," and therefore what is best liked is to be preferred [for the benediction][4] ; but he who laughed thought that for cooked vegetables it is "...Who createst the fruit of the ground" and for poultry "...By Whose word all things exist," and therefore the fruit should be given precedence ? No ; they both agreed that for cooked vegetables and poultry it is "...By Whose word all things exist" ; and here they differed on the following point : One thought that what is best liked is to be preferred [for the benediction], whereas the other thought that the cabbage should receive precedence because it is nourishing[5]. 

R. Zera said : When we were at the school of Rab Huna he said to us : For the tops of turnips, if he cut them into large pieces, the benediction is "...Who createst the fruit of the ground"; if into small pieces, it is "...By Whose word all things exist[6]." But when we came to the school of Rab Judah he said : In either case it is "...Who createst the fruit of the ground," because one cuts them up a great deal to sweeten the taste. Rab Ashe said : When we were at the school of Rab Kahana he said to us : For a broth of beet, into which one does not put much flour, the benediction is "...Who createst the fruit of the ground " ; for a broth of turnip, into which much flour is put, it is "...Who createst various kinds of foods." Afterwards he said : In either case it is "...Who createst the fruit of the ground," and that they put much flour into it is only done to make it adhere. 

Rab Hisda said : The broth of beet is pleasant to the heart and good for the eyes, how much more so for the bowels. Abbai said : That is only so when it remains on the stove and makes the sound Tuk, Tuk[1]. Rab Pappa said : It is evident to me that the water of the beet is like the beet[2], the water of the turnip like the turnip, and the water of all vegetables like the vegetables themselves. Rab Pappa asked : How is it with dill-water ? Is it used to sweeten the taste[3] or to remove the bad smell? Come and hear: Dill, when it gives a taste to the dish, does not come under the law of Terumah[4] and does not contract the impurity of foods. Conclude from this that it is used to sweeten the taste! Draw that conclusion. 

Rab Hiyya b. Ashe said : Over stale bread [which has been placed] in a pot [to soak], the benediction is "...Who bringest forth bread from the earth." This is at variance with R. Hiyya[5] who said : This benediction must conclude with [the cutting or breaking of] the bread[6]. Raba retorted : Why is stale bread different, that no [benediction should be pronounced before partaking thereof] ? Is it because when the benediction is concluded, it is concluded over a divided loaf ? But in the case of [fresh] bread also, when the benediction is concluded, it is likewise concluded [[fol. 39b.]] over a divided loaf ! But, declared Raba : One says the benediction and afterwards breaks [the bread]. The people of Nehardea[7] acted according to R. Hiyya, but the Rabbis acted according to Raba. Rabina said : My mother told me, "Thy father acted according to R. Hiyya, for R. Hiyya maintained that the benediction must conclude with [the breaking of] the bread ; but the Rabbis acted according to Raba." The Halakah is in agreement with Raba who maintained that one should say the benediction and afterwards break the bread. 

It has been reported : If pieces of bread and whole loaves were set before them, Rab Huna declares that the benediction is to be pronounced over the pieces and it is not necessary over the loave[8]. R. Johanan declared : [To say the benediction over] the whole loaf is the best way to perform the religious duty ; but should there be a piece of wheaten-bread and a loaf of barley-bread, all agree that the benediction should be pronounced over the former[1] and is unnecessary over the latter. R. Jeremiah b. Abba said : It is like [the discussion of] the Tannaim, viz.: We take Terumah with a whole onion, though small in size, but not with half of a large onion. R. Judah says : Not so, but we take it with the half of a large onion. Do they not differ on the following point : One[2] maintains that which is of greater value is to be preferred, while the other maintains that which is whole is to be preferred ? Where there is a priest present[3], there is no difference of opinion that what is of greater value is to be preferred, the disagreement arising where there is no priest[4]. For there is a Mishnaic teaching : Wherever there is a priest present, the Terumah is to be taken from the best, but where there is no priest, it is to be taken from that which is most durable ; R. Judah says : It is only to be taken from the best. Rab Nahman b. Isaac said : He who fears Heaven complies with the regulation of the law according to the teaching of both[5] ; and who is it [that acts thus]? Mar b. Rabina, for he used to place the piece of bread with the whole loaf and break both. 

A Tanna taught in the presence of Rab Nahman b. Isaac[6] : One should place the piece of bread with the whole loaf and break them both and then say the benediction. Rab Nahman said to him, "What is thy name?" He replied, "Shalman[7]." He said to him, "Peaceful art thou and peaceful thy teaching, for thou hast restored peace between the disciples." Rab Pappa said : All agree that on Passover one should place the piece together with the whole and break them both. What is the reason ? "Bread of affliction" (Deut. xvi. 3) it is written[8]. 

R. Abba[9] said : On the Sabbath one should break bread over two loaves. What is the reason ? "Twice as much bread" (Exod. xvi 22) it is written[1]. Rab Aahe said : I saw Rab Kahana take two loaves but only break one[2]. R. Zera used to break oflf [on the Sabbath a piece of bread to suffice] for the whole of the meal. Rabina said to Rab Ashe : But this must have looked like voracity ! He replied : Since he did not act so every day but only now [on the Sabbath] it would not have that appearance. When R. Ammi and R. Assi had occasion to use the bread of 'Erub, they would pronounce over it the benediction "...Who bringest forth bread from the earth," saying, "Since one religious duty[3] is being fulfilled therewith, let us perform still another[4]." 

[[fol. 40 a.]] Rab[5] declared: [If one broke the bread and pronounced the benediction, and before eating handed a piece to another saying,] "Take it, the benediction has been made; take it, the benediction has been made ! " it is unnecessary for him to pronounce it again [before partaking of the bread][6]. [But if before eating he says,] "Bring salt, bring the relish," he must repeat the benediction. R. Johanan declared that even if he said, "Bring salt, bring the relish," he likewise need not repeat the benediction[7]. [Should he, however, say,] "Mix food for the oxen ! Mix food for the oxen !" the benediction must be repeated. Rab Sheshet declared that even if he said "Mix food for the oxen," he also need not repeat the benediction. For Rab Judah said in the name of Rab: A man must not eat his meal before giving food to his cattle ; as it is said, "And I will give grass in thy fields for thy cattle" and then "thou shalt eat and be satisfied" (Deut. xi. 15). 

Raba b. Samuel said in the name of R. Hiyya[8] : The one who is about to break bread is not permitted to do so until they place salt or relish before each person. Raba b. Samuel visited the house of the Exilarch[9]. They set bread before him and he broke it forthwith[1]. They said to him, "Has the master retracted his teaching?" He replied, "This bread[2] requires no condiment[3]." 

Raba b. Samuel also said in the name of R. Hiyya : Urine is only completely evacuated in a sitting posture[4]. Rab Kahana said[5] : Where there is loose earth, this is so even when standing[6]; and should there be no loose earth, let him stand on an elevated place and urinate on to a declivity. 

Raba b. Samuel also Said in the name of R. Hiyya : After every food eat salt, and after every beverage drink water, and thou wilt not come to harm[7]. There is a teaching to the same effect : After every food eat salt, and after every beverage drink water, and thou wilt not come to harm. There is another teaching : Who has partaken of any food without eating salt or drunk any beverage without drinking water will be troubled during the day with a bad odour in his mouth and at night with croup. 

Our Rabins have taught: He who makes his food float in water[8] will not suffer with indigestion. How much [should he drink] ? Rab Hisda said : A cupful to a loaf. 

Rab Mari said in the name of R. Johanan : He who makes it a habit to eat lentils once in thirty days keeps croup away from his house ; but not every day. What is the reason[9] ? Because it is bad for the breath of the mouth. R. Mari also said in the name of R. Johanan : He who makes it a habit to eat mustard once in thirty days keeps illnesses away from his house ; but not every day. What is the reason ? Because it is bad for heartweakness. Rab Hiyya b. Ashe said in the name of Rab : He who makes it a habit to eat small fish will not suffer with indigestion ; more than that, small fish make a man's whole body fruitful[10] and strong. Rab Hamma b. R. Hannina said: He who makes it a habit to use black cumin will not suffer with pain of the heart. It is quoted in objection : Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel says : Black cumin is one of the sixty deadly poisons, and he who sleeps to the east of his store [of cumin], his blood is on his own head[1] ! There is no contradiction ; the latter referring to its odour, the other to its taste. The mother of R. Jeremiah used to bake bread for him and sprinkle [black cumin] upon it, and then scrape it off[2]. 

But R. Judah declares : "...Who createst divers kinds of herbs." 

R. Zera (another version : R. Hinnana b. Pappa) said : The Halakah is not in accord with R. Judah[3]. R. Zera (another version: R. Hinnana b. Pappa) also said: What is R. Judah's reason[4]? The Scriptures state, "Blessed be the Lord day by day" (Ps. Ixviii. 20) — are we to bless Him by day and not by night ! Nay, it means to tell thee : Day by day give Him the appropriate blessing[5] ; so here also, for every species of food give Him an appropriate benediction. 

R. Zera (another version : R. Hinnana b. Pappa) also said : Come and see that the attribute of the Holy One, blessed be He, is not like that of the human being. The attribute of the human being is to support the empty vessel[6] but not the full ; but the Holy One, blessed be He, is not so — He supports the full vessel, not the empty[7]. As it is said, "And He said. If hearing, thou wilt hear" (sic ! Exod. xv. 26) — i.e. if thou wilt hear [once], thou wilt hear again[8]; but if not, thou wilt not hear. Another explanation is : If thou wilt hear the old, thou wilt also hear the new[9]; but should thine heart turn aside [from the Torah], thou wilt never again hear. 

MISHNAH II 

If one said the benediction "... Who createst the fruit of the ground" over fruits of the tree, he has complied with the requirements of the law. If, over fruits of the earth, he said "...Who createst the fruit of the tree," he has not so complied. If over all of them he said "...By Whose word all things exist," he has complied with the requirements of the law. 

GEMARA 

Who is it that teaches that the main feature about the tree is the earth[1]? Rab Nahman b. Isaac said: It is R. Judah ; for there is a Mishnaic teaching: If the water-supply dried up[2] or the tree was cut down, one brings [the first-fruits to Jerusalem] but does not make the declaration[3]. R. Judah says: He both brings [the first-fruits] and makes the declaration[4]. 

If, over fruits of the earth, etc.  

This is evident ! Rab Nahman b. Isaac said : It is only necessary for R. Judah who declares that wheat is a kind of tree ; for there is a teaching : The tree from which Adam ate was — so says R. Meir — the vine, because thou hast nothing which brings lamentation upon man as does wine; as it is said, "And he drank of the wine, and was drunken" (Gen. ix. 21). R. Nehemiah says: It was the fig-tree, for by the very thing that they were disgraced were they restored ; as it is said, "And they sewed fig-leaves together" (ibid. iii. 7). R. Judah said : It was wheat, because a child does not know to call "Father, mother" before it has tasted wheat[5]. It may enter thy mind to say that since R. Judah maintains that wheat is a kind of tree, the benediction over it should be "...Who createst the fruit of the tree"! Therefore we are informed that we say the benediction "...Who createst the fruit of the tree" only where, if thou takest away the fruit, a stem [[fol. 40 b. ]] remains which again produces ; but where, if thou takest away the fruit, there is no stem to produce again fruit[1], we do not say the benediction "...Who createst the fruit of the tree" but "...Who createst the fruit of the ground." 

If over all of them he said "...By Whose word all things exist," etc. 

It has been reported : Rab Huna said : Except bread and wine[2] ; but R. Johanan said : Even bread and wine. Let us say that this is like [the following controversy of] the Tannaim : If one sees bread and exclaims, "How fine is this bread ; blessed be the All-present Who created it," he has complied with the requirements of the law[3]. If he sees a fig and exclaims, "How fine is this fig, blessed be the All-present Who created it," he has likewise complied. These are the words of R. Meir ; but R. Jose says : Whoever changes the form which the Sages assigned to the benedictions has not fulfilled his obligation. Let us say that Rab Huna is in agreement with R. Jose[4] and R. Johanan with R. Meir[5]! Rab Huna could tell thee: I am even in agreement with R. Meir ; for R. Meir only speaks above of a case where one mentions the name of bread, but where he does not mention the name of bread, even R. Meir admits [that the man's words do not constitute a valid benediction][6]. R. Johanan, on the other hand, could tell thee : I am in agreement even with R. Jose ; for R. Jose only disagrees above because the man used a form of benediction which the Rabbis had not ordained, but if he had said "...By Whose word all things exist" which the Rabbis had ordained, even R. Jose admits [that it would be valid]. 

Benjamin the shepherd used to double the bread[7] and say "Blessed be the Lord of this bread[8]." Rab said: He thereby complied with the requirements of the law. But Rab has declared : A benediction which contains no mention of the Divine Name is no benediction[1]! What Benjamin did say was "Blessed be the All-merciful, the Lord of this bread." But lo, we require three benedictions! What means, then, "he has complied with the requirements of the law" as stated by Rab? He has complied so far as the first benediction is concerned[2]. What does he intend to teach us? That [it is valid] although he said it in a non-holy tongue[3]! We have already learnt : The following may be said in any language : The portion of the Sotah[4], the declaration concerning the tithe[5], the Shema', Tefillah and the Grace after meals[6]! [Nevertheless Rab's statement] was necessary ; for it might have entered thy mind to say that this[7] only applies when one utters the benediction in a non-holy language exactly as the Rabbis ordained it in the holy tongue ; but should he not say it in the non-holy language exactly as the Rabbis ordained it in the holy tongue, I am to declare that he has not [complied]. Therefore he informs us [that the benediction is valid even when the wording does not exactly conform to the Hebrew original]. 

It was stated above : "Rab said : A benediction which contains no mention of the Divine Name is no benediction." But R. Johanan has said : A benediction which contains no reference to the Divine Kingship[8] is no benediction! Abbai said: Rab's opinion seems more probable ; for there is a teaching[9] : [It is written] "I have not transgressed any of Thy commandments, neither have I forgotten" (Deut. xxvi. 13) — "I have not transgressed," i.e. by omitting the benediction, "neither have I forgotten," i.e. to mention Thy Name thereby ; but he does not teach here [that it is necessary to refer to] the Kingship. (R. Johanan, however, explains : "Neither have I forgotten," i.e. to mention Thy Name and Kingship thereby[10].) 

MISHNAH III, IV 

III. Over anything whose growth is not from the earth, one says "...By Whose word all things exist." Over vinegar, fruit which falls unripe from the tree and locusts, one says "...By Whose word all things exist." R. Judah declares: No benediction is to be pronounced over anything which comes under the category of a curse[1]. 

IV. If there were several kinds of food before him, R. Judah says: Should there be among them one of the seven species[2], he pronounces the benediction over that. The Sages declare: He may say it over whichever of them he pleases. 

GEMARA

Our Rabbis have taught : Over anything whose growth is not food the earth, e.g. the flesh of cattle, beasts, birds and fish, one says "...By Whose word all things exist." Over milk, eggs and cheese, one says "...By Whose word." Over bread which has become mouldy, wine over which a film has formed, and cooked food which has gone bad[3], one says "...By Whose word." Over salt, brine, morils and truffles, one says "...By Whose word." That is to say that morils and truffles are not grown from the soil. There is, however, a teaching : He who vows not to eat fruits grown from the earth is forbidden to eat the fruits of the earth but is allowed morils and truffles; if he declares, "All that is grown from the earth shall be forbidden me," he is also prohibited from eating morils and truffles ! Abbai replied: These grow from the earth but do not derive their nutriment therefrom. But lo, the Mishnah reads : Anything whose growth is not from the earth! Read, "Anything which does not derive nutriment from the earth," 

Over fruit which falls unripe from the tree [nobelot].
 
What are nobelot? R. Zera and R. El'a [differ in their explanation]. One says: They are the fruit scorched by the sun; the other says : They are dates blown from the tree by the wind. Our Mishnah states : R. Judah declares : No benediction is to be pronounced over anything which comes under the category of a curse. That is quite right according to him who says nobelot means "Fruit scorched by the sun," for that may be called a kind of curse ; but according to him who says it means "Dates blown from the tree by the wind," how is this a kind of curse? [R. Judah's statement refers] to the remainder[1]. 

Another version : It is quite right according to him who says nobelot means "Fruit scorched by the sun" that over it we pronounce the benediction "...By Whose word"; but according to him who says [it means] "Dates blown from the tree by the wind" the benediction "...By Whose word" should rather be "...Who createst the fruit of the tree[2]" ! Nay, everybody agrees that nobelot without further qualification means "Fruit scorched by the sun"; where they differ is with reference to nobelot temarah. For there is a Mishnaic teaching: Those fruits with which, in case of doubt as to the tithe[3], the law deals leniently are: Shitin, Rimin, 'Uzradin[4], Benot Shuah, Benot Shikmah, Gofnin, Nispah and Nobelot Temarah. Shitin, Rabbah b. Bar Hannah said in the name of R. Johanan, are a species of figs. Rimin are lote[5]. 'Uzradin are crab-apples. Benot Shuah, Rabbah b. Bar Hannah said in the name of R. Johanan, are white figs. Benot Shikmah, Rabbah b. Bar Hannah said in the name of R. Johanan, are sycamore-figs. Gofnin are late grapes. Nispah is the caper-bush. Nobelot Temarah — R. El'a and R. Zera [differ in their explanation] — One says "Fruit scorched by the sun" ; the other says "Dates blown from the tree by the wind." It is quite right according to him who says [it means] "Fruit scorched by the sun," that is what he teaches, viz. "Those fruits with which, in case of doubt as to the tithe, the law deals leniently" — it is the doubt that exempts them [from the tithe], but if there is certainty[6], then they are subject. But according to him who says it means "Dates blown from the tree by the wind," how can they be subject [to the tithe] in the case of certainty, since they are public property[7]? With what are we here dealing? With a case where he has arranged them for storage; for R. Isaac[1] stated that R. Johanan said in the name of R. Eliezer b. Jacob : Gleanings, forgotten sheaves, and the produce of the corner of the field[2], if he[3] arranged them for storage, they become subject to the tithe. 

[[fol. 41 a.]] Others say: It is quite right according to him who maintains it[4] means "Dates blown from the tree by the wind" — then that is why he mentions here [in our Mishnah] nobelot without further specification[5] and there [in the Mishnaic quotation] he calls it [nobelot] temarah. But according to him who says [nobelot temarah] means "Fruit scorched by the sun," let him teach in both passages[6] either nobelot temarah or nobelot without further specification ! The question [remains unanswered]. 

IV. If there were several kinds of food before him, etc. 

'Ulla said : The difference of opinion arises when the benediction is the same for them ; for R. Judah holds that one of the seven species is to be given preference, whereas the Rabbis hold that the kind which is best liked should be given preference. Where, however, the benediction is not the same, all agree that he should first say it over that which he likes best and then say it over the others. 

Against this is quoted : If radishes and olives were before him, he pronounces the benediction over the radishes and he is exempt from saying it over the olives[7] ! With what are we here dealing? With the case where the radishes are the principal item[8]. If so, I will quote the continuation : R. Judah says : He pronounces the benediction over the olive, because it belongs to the seven species ! Does not R. Judah agree with the Mishnaic teaching : In the case of a food which is the principal thing and together with it is something accessory, the benediction is to be uttered over the former and there is no necessity for a benediction over the latter[9]? Shouldest thou declare that here also R. Judah is not in agreement, lo there is a teaching : R. Judah says : If the olive is only there on account of the radish, he pronounces the benediction over the radish and it is unnecessary over the olive ! We certainly deal here with the case where the radish is the principal item ; and where R. Judah and the Rabbis differ is in another matter. The text is defective and should read thus : If radishes and olives were before him, he says the benediction over the former and it is unnecessary over the latter. Of what does it speak here? When the radish is the principal item ; but should that not be so, all agree that he says the benediction over one and then over the other. Where there are two species, the benediction for which is the same, he says the benediction over any one he pleases R. Judah says : He utters it over the olive, because it is one of the seven species. 

R. Ammi and R. Isaac Nappaha[1] are at variance over this matter[2]. One declares that the difierence of opinion arises when the benediction is the same, for R. Judah holds that one of the seven species is to be given preference, whereas the Rabbis hold that the kind which is best liked is to be given preference. Where, however, the benediction is not the same, all agree that he says the benediction over one and then over the other. The second [Rabbi] declares that there is difference of opinion even where the benediction is not the same. It is quite right according to him who declares that there is difference of opinion where the benediction is the same; that is clear. But according to him who declares that they disagree where the benediction is not the same, in what do they differ? R. Jeremiah said : In which is to come first ; for Rab Joseph (another version : R. Isaac) said : Whatever is given precedence in the Scriptural verse must take precedence for the benediction ; as it is said, "A land of wheat and barley, and vines and fig-trees and pomegranates, a land of olivetrees and honey" (Deut. viii. 8)[3]. 

This teaching, however, conflicts with the statement of R. Hanan[4] who said: This whole verse only speaks of "standards[5]." "Wheat" — for there is a Mishnaic teaching : Whoever enters a plague-infected house with his garments upon his shoulders, his sandals and rings in his hand, he and they immediately become unclean[1]. If he was clothed in his garments, his sandals upon his feet and his rings upon his finger, he immediately becomes un-clean, but they remain undefiled until he tarries there a sufficient time to eat a peras[2] of wheaten-bread[3], but not barley-bread, reclining and eating it with a relish. "Barley" — for there is a Mishnaic teaching : The bone [of a dead person or animal] the size of barley defiles by touch and carrying, but does not defile in a tent[4]. "Vine" — it requires a fourth [of a Log] of wine for a Nazirite[5]. "Fig-tree" — to carry as much as a dried fig [from a private to a public court or vice versa] constitutes a breach of the Sabbath. "Pomegranate" — as we have the Mishnaic teaching : [[fol. 41 b.]] The vessels of house-owners[6] have the standard size of a pomegranate[7]. "A land of Olive-trees" — R. Jose b. R. Hannina said: [This means], a land where the standard for everything is the size of the olive. The standard for everything, dost imagine? Lo, there are the others just mentioned[8] ! Nay, [the meaning is], a land where the standard for most things is the size of the olive. "Honey" — one must have eaten as much as a large date on the Day of Atonement [to have incurred the penalty for breaking the fast]. But the other [Rabbi][9]? [He asks] : Are these standards explicitly stated in this verse ? No, they are ordained by the Rabbis, and this verse serves only as a support. 

Rab Hisda and Rab Hamnuna were sitting at a meal, when dates and pomegranates were set before them. Rab Hamnuna took and pronounced the benediction over the dates first. Rab Hisda said to him, "Does not the master agree with the statement of Rab Joseph (another version : R. Isaac), viz. : That which is given precedence in the verse (Deut. viii. 8) must precede for the benediction?" He replied, "'Dates[10]' is the second word after 'land,' 'pomegranate' the fifth word after 'land[1]'." Rab Hisda said to him, "Would that we had iron feet so that we could always [follow and] listen to thee!" 

It has been reported : If they set before them figs and grapes in the middle of a meal, Rab Huna declared that they require a benediction before partaking thereof but not after. Similarly said Rab Nahman : They require a benediction before partaking thereof but not after. But Rab Sheshet said : They require a benediction both before and after, because there is nothing which requires a benediction before partaking thereof which does not require one after it, bread offered as a dessert[2] being alone excepted. This is at variance with the statement of R. Hiyya who said : [The benediction over] bread exempts all other articles of food, and that over wine exempts all other kinds of beverage [from the necessity of another benediction]. Rab Pappa said : The Halakah is — Articles of food which are brought in connection with the meal[3], in the course of the meal, require a benediction neither before nor after; if they are not brought in connection with the meal[4], in the course of the meal, they require a benediction before but not after ; if brought after the meal, they require a benediction before and after. 

They asked Ben Zoma : Why is it said, "Articles of food brought in connection with the meal, in the course of the meal, require a benediction neither before nor after"? He replied : Because [the benediction over] the bread makes it unnecessary. If so, let the bread make [a benediction] unnecessary also for the wine ! It is different with wine, because it necessitates a benediction for itself[5]. 

Rab Huna ate thirteen rolls[6], three to a Kab in size, and said no Grace. Rab Nahman said to him, "Is there still hunger!" But everything which others fix as a meal requires Grace. 

Rab Judah was holding the wedding-feast for his son in the house of Rab Judah b. Habiba[1]. They set before him bread as dessert ; and when it came, he heard them say hammosi. He said to them, "What is the sisi I hear? Perhaps it is the benediction hammosi' that you have said ?" They replied, "It is ; for there is a teaching : R. Mona said in the name of R. Judah : We do pronounce hammosi over bread-dessert, and Samuel declared that the Halakah is in agreement with R. Mona." He said to them, "The Halakah is not in agreement with him." It is reported that they said to him, "But lo, the master has himself declared in the name of Samuel : The bread-wafers used as dessert may be utilised as an 'Erub and we say the benediction hammosi' over them!" 

[He replied,] "It is different there [with the 'Erub)] because one makes a meal of them ; but here where one does not make a meal of them, no [benediction is necessary]." 

Rab Pappa went on a visit to the house of Rab Huna b. Rab Nathan. After they had finished their meal, they set before them several things to eat. Rab Pappa took of them and ate. They said to him, "Does not the master hold that if one has finished [his meal], he must not eat anything further[3]?" He replied, "This has only been said when the table has been cleared." 

Raba[4] and R. Zera went on a visit to the house of the Exilarch. After the tray had been taken away from before them, there was sent to them from the Exilarch's house a gift [of fruit][5]. Raba ate it, but R. Zera did not. The latter said to him, "Does not the master hold that if the table has been cleared, it is forbidden to eat?" He replied, "We depend upon the Exilarch's tray[6]." 

Rab said : He who is accustomed [to anoint his hands] with oil [after finishing a meal], the oil impedes him[7] Rab Ashe said : When we were at the school of Rab Kahana, he said to us, "For instance we are accustomed to the use of oil, and the oil impedes us." But the Halakah is in agreement with none of these teachings, but with that which Rab Hiyya b. Ashe said in the name of Rab, viz.: There are three actions which have to be performed with dispatch : the putting on of hands[1] must be followed immediately by the act of slaughtering ; the Tefillah must follow immediately on the Ge'ullah[2] ; and the Grace after meals must follow immediately on the washing of the hands[3]. Abbai[4] declared : We also add[5] : A benediction [immediately alights upon him who entertains] disciples of the wise[6] ; as it is said, "The Lord hath blessed me for thy sake" (Gen. xxx. 27); or, if thou wilt, from this passage, as it is said, "The Lord blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake " (ibid. xxxix. 5). 

MISHNAH V, VI 

V. If a man said the benediction over wine before the meal, he is exempt from saying it over the wine after the meal. If he said it over the dainty[7] served before the meal, he is exempt from saying it over the dainty served after the meal. If he said it over the bread, he is exempt from saying it over the dainty; over the dainty, he is not exempt from saying it over the bread. Bet Shammai declare : Nor from saying it over a cooked dish. 

VI. If men were sitting [at the meal], each one says Grace for himself. If they were reclining[8], one may say it for all. If wine [[fol. 42 b.]] is set for them in the course of the meal, each one says the benediction for himself; after the meal, one may say it for all. The same one says the benediction over the perfume, although they do not bring the perfume until after the meal. 

GEMARA 

Rabbah b. Bar Hannah said in the name of R. Johanan : The teaching[9] applies only to Sabbaths and Festivals, for then a man arranges his meal with wine[10]; but on other days of the year, a benediction is to be said over each cup of wine. It has been similarly reported : Rabbah b. Mari[1] said in the name of R. Joshua b. Levi : The teaching applies only to Sabbaths and Festivals and the time when one comes from the bath-house and the meal after blood-letting, for then a man arranges his meal with wine; but on the other days of the year, a benediction is to be said over each cup of wine. 

Rabbah b. Mari visited the house of Raba on a week-day, and noticed him pronounce the benediction [over the wine] before the meal and again after it ; and he said to him, "That is correct, and so also said R. Joshua b. Levi." Rab Isaac b. Joseph visited the house of Abbai on a Festival and noticed that he pronounced the benediction over each cup. He said to him, "Does not the master agree with the opinion of R. Joshua b. Levi ?" He replied, "It only just occurred to me[2]." 

The question was asked : How is it if wine is brought in the course of the meal[3] — does it make the benediction over the wine after the meal unnecessary? Shouldest thou wish to quote our Mishnah : If a man said the benediction over wine before the meal, he is exempt from saying it over the wine after the meal — this is because both of them are for drinking ; but here, since one[4] is for steeping and the other for drinking, it is not so ; or perhaps that makes no difference ? Rab said : He is exempt [from repeating the benediction] ; but Rab Kahana said : He is not. Rab Nahman said: He is exempt; but Rab Sheshet said : He is not. Rab Huna, Rab Judah and all the pupils of Rab say : He is not[5]. Raba quoted against Rab Nahman : If wine is set for them in the course of the meal, each one says the benediction for himself ; after the meal, one may say it for all[6]! He replied : This is what he means to say[7], If no wine was set for them in the course of the meal, only after it, then one may say the benediction for all. If he said it over the bread, he is exempt from saying it over the dainty ; over the dainty, he is not exempt from saying it over the bread. Bet Shammai declare : Nor from saying it over a cooked dish. 

The question was asked : Are Bet Shammai in disagreement with the first clause of this teaching, or is it perhaps with the second clause? They are in disagreement with the first clause[1]; for the first Tanna declares : If he said it over the bread, he is exempt from saying it over the dainty, so how much more [is it unnecessary for him to say a benediction] over a cooked dish ; then Bet Shammai come to declare that not only does [the benediction over] the bread not exempt that over the dainty, but it does not even exempt that over a cooked dish ! Or is it perhaps with the second clause that Bet Shammai disagree? For it teaches : [Having said the benediction] over the dainty, he is not exempt from saying it over the bread ; it is [the benediction over] the bread from which he is not exempt, but he is exempt from that over the cooked dish ; and then Bet Shammai come to say : He is not even exempt from that over the cooked dish ! The question [remains unanswered]. 

VI. If men were sitting [at the meal], each one says Grace for himself. 

If they were reclining, then yes[2]; but if they were not reclining. no ! Against this I quote the following : If ten were journeying by the way, although they all partake of one loaf, each of them says Grace for himself ; should they sit down to eat, although each eats of his own loaf, one may say Grace for all. Note that he here states "they sit," i.e. although they are not reclining ! Rab Nahman b. Isaac said : [This Baraita refers to the case where] for instance men say, "Let us go and eat our meal in a certain place[3]." 

When Rab died, his disciples followed his cortege. On their return they said, "Let us go and have our meal by the River Danak[4]." After they had eaten, they sat on and the question was asked : Does our Mishnah intend that only when they recline [does one say the benediction for all] and not if they sit ; or is it perhaps that where people say, "Let us go and eat our meal in a certain place" this is to be regarded the same as reclining? They were unable [to answer the question]. Rab Adda b. Ahabah stood up, [[fol. 43 a.]] turned the torn part of his garment[1] to the rear and made a fresh tear, exclaiming, "Rab has died and we have not learnt [the regulations of] the Grace after meals!" In the meanwhile an Elder came and pointed out the disagreement between our Mishnah and the Baraita[2], and taught them : When men say, "Let us go and eat our meal in a certain place," it is the same as if they had reclined. 

If they were reclining, one may say Grace for all. 

Rab said : This teaching applies only to bread for which reclining is necessary, but for wine reclining is not necessary. R. Johanan, however, said : Even for wine likewise reclining is needed. (Another version : Rab said : This teaching applies only to bread where it is beneficial to recline, but with wine it is not beneficial to recline. R. Johanan, however, said : Even with wine it is likewise beneficial to recline.) Against this teaching is quoted : What is the procedure of reclining[3]? The guests enter and seat themselves upon stools and chairs until all are assembled. Then water is brought to them, and each washes one hand[4]. Wine is set for them, and each says the benediction for himself. They thereupon ascend [the couch] and recline, and water is brought before them ; and although each one has washed one hand, he again washes both hands[5]. Wine is brought to them[6], and although each has said the benediction for himself, one may now say it for all ! According to one version of Rab's statement, viz. : "This teaching applies only to bread for which reclining is necessary, but for wine reclining is not necessary," the first part [of this Baraita] is in disagreement[7]! It is different with guests, because it is their intention to move their position[8]. And according to the other version of Rab's statement, viz. : "This teaching applies only to bread where it is beneficial to recline, but with wine it is not beneficial to recline," the latter part [of the Baraita] is in disagreement[1] ! It is different there, because while it is beneficial to recline for the bread, it is at the same time beneficial to recline for the wine. 

If wine is set for them in the course of the meal. 

Ben Zoma was asked : Why is it stated : If wine is set for them in the course of the meal, each one says the benediction for himself; after the meal, one may say it for all ? He replied : Because the gullet is not empty[2]. 

The same one says the benediction over the perfume, etc. 

Since he teaches, The same one says the benediction over the perfume, it is to be inferred that there may be somebody more worthy than he ; why, then, [is it his privilege] ? Because he is the first to wash his hands at the conclusion of the meal. This supports the statement of Rab ; for Rab Hiyya b. Ashe said in the name of Rab : He who is the first to wash his hands at the conclusion of the meal has the privilege of saying Grace. Rab and R. Hiyya were sitting at table in the presence of Rabbi. Rabbi said to Rab, "Arise, wash thy hands." R. Hiyya noticed that Rab was trembling[3], and said to him, "O son of princes[4]! See it is for the privilege of saying Grace after meals that Rabbi tells thee [to wash]." 

R. Zera said in the name of Raba b. Jeremiah[5] : From what time may we say the benediction over the smell [of the perfume][6]? From the time its column of smoke ascends. R. Zera said to Raba b. Jeremiah, "But one has not yet smelt it!" He replied, "According to thy reasoning, one says the Grace before meals but has not yet eaten ! His intention is to eat, and so here likewise it is his intention to smell." 

R. Hiyya b. Abba[1] b. Nahmani stated that Rab Hisda said in the name of Rab (another version : Rab Hisda said in the name of Ze'iri) : Overall kinds of perfumes the benediction is "...Who Greatest fragrant woods," excepting musk which comes from a species of animal and its benediction is "...Who createst various kinds of spices." Against this teaching is quoted : We only say "...Who createst fragrant woods" over the balsam-trees of the house of Rabbi[2] and the balsam-trees of the Emperor's palace and over the myrtle-tree wherever it comes from ! This refutation [remains unanswered]. 

Rab Hisda asked Rab Isaac[3], "What is the benediction over balsam-oil?" He replied, "Thus said Rab Judah : It is '...Who createst the oil of our land '." Rab Hisda said to him, "Leave out Rab Judah, because the land of Israel is very dear to him ; what is the benediction generally?" He replied, "Thus said R. Johanan : It is '...Who createst fragrant oil'." Rab Adda b. Ahabah said: Over costum the benediction is "...Who createst fragrant woods," but not over the oil in which it is steeped. Rab Kahana said : [That is the benediction] even for the oil in which it is steeped, but not the oil with which it is ground. The men of Nehardea[4] said : [That is the benediction] even for the oil in which it is ground. 

[[fol. 43 b.]] Rab Giddel said in the name of Rab : Over jasmine[5] the benediction is "...Who createst fragrant woods." Rab Hananel said in the name of Rab: Over sea-rush the benediction is "...Who createst fragrant woods." Mar Zotra said : What is the Scriptural authority[6]? "She had brought them up to the roof, and hid them with the stalks of flax[7]" (Josh. ii. 6). Rab Mesharsheya said : Over the garden-narcissus the benediction is "...Who createst fragrant woods," but over the wild narcissus "...Who createst fragrant herbs." Rab Sheshet said : Over violets the benediction is "...Who createst fragrant herbs." Mar Zotra[8] said : He who smells the citron or quince should say "Blessed be He Who setteth a beautiful fragrance in fruits." Rab Judah said : He who goes out during the days of Nisan and sees the trees budding should say "Blessed be He Who has caused nothing to be lacking in His Universe and created therein beautiful creations and beautiful trees where-from men may derive pleasure." 

Rab Zotra b. Tobiah said in the name of Rab : Whence is it learnt that one should pronounce a benediction over a fragrant smell? As it is written, "Let every soul[1] praise the Lord" (Ps. cl. 6). From what is it that the soul, but not the body, derives enjoyment? Say it is a fragrant smell. 

Rab Zotra b. Tobiah also said in the name of Rab : The young men of Israel will in the future give forth a sweet fragrance like Lebanon ; as it is said, "His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive-tree, and his fragrance as Lebanon" (Hosea xiv. 7). 

Rab Zotra b. Tobiah also said in the name of Rab : What means that which is written, "He hath made everything beautiful in its time" (Eccles. iii. 11)? It teaches that the Holy One, blessed be He, makes every occupation agreeable in the eyes of those who follow it. Rab Pappa said : Hence the proverb, "Hang the heart of a palm-tree around a sow, and it will act as usual[2]." 

Rab Zotra b. Tobiah also said in the name of Rab : [Walking by the light of] a torch is equal to two[3]; by moonlight is equal to three. The question was asked : Is the light of the torch equal to two, including himself ; or perhaps it is equal to two excluding himself? Come and hear: [It is stated,] "By moonlight is equal to three." That is quite right if thou sayest it means including himself, well and good ; but if thou sayest it means excluding himself, why are four necessary? For lo, the teacher has said : To a single person an evil spirit appears and injures him ; to two it appears but does not injure them ; to three it does not appear at all ! Certainly it is to be concluded that the expression "torchlight is equal to two" means including himself. Draw that conclusion. 

Rab Zotra b. Tobiah also said in the name of Rab (another version : Rab Hanna b. Bizna in the name of R. Simeon Hasida ; still another version : R. Johanan said in the name of R. Simeon b. Johai) : It were better for a man to cast himself into the midst of a fiery furnace rather than cause the face of his fellow-creature to blanche in public[1]. Whence is this derived ? From Tamar ; as it is said, "When she was brought forth" etc. (Gen. xxxviii. 25)[2]. 

Our Rabbis have taught: If they set before him oil and myrtle[3], Bet Shammai declare : He first says the benediction over the oil and then over the myrtle ; Bet Hillel declare : He first says the benediction over the myrtle and then over the oil. Rabban[4] Gamaliel said : I will diecide — Oil we use for its fragrance and for anointing, whereas we use the myrtle only for its fragrance and not for anointing[5]. R. Johanan said : The Halakah is in accord with him who decided. Rab Pappa visited the house of Rab Huna b. Rab Ika[6]; they set before him oil and myrtle. He took and made the benediction first over the myrtle and then over the oil. Rab Huna said to him : Does not the master hold that the Halakah is in accord with the words of him who decided ? He replied : Thus said Raba : The Halakah is in accord with Bet Hillel. But it was not so, and he only did this to extricate himself. 

Our Rabbis have taught : If oil and wine are set before him, Bet Shammai declare : He should take hold of the oil in his right hand and the wine in his left, say the benediction over the oil and then over the wine ; Bet Hillel declare : He should take hold of the wine in his right hand and the oil in his left, say the benediction over the wine and then over the oil. And he should rub the oil upon the head of the attendant[7] ; but if the attendant be a disciple of the wise, he should rub it upon the wall, because it is a disgrace for a disciple of the wise to go into the street perfumed. 

Our Rabbis have taught : Six[8] things are a disgrace to a disciple of the wise : He should not go out into the street perfumed ; nor go out alone at night ; nor go out with patched sandals ; nor converse with a woman in the street ; nor recline in the company of 'Amme ha'ares ; nor be the last to enter the House of Study. Some declare that he should also not walk with a big stride, nor walk with an erect carriage. He should not go out into the street perfumed. R. Abha b. R. Hiyya b. Abba said in the name of R. Johanan[1] : This refers to a place where people are suspected of pederasty. Rab Sheshet said : They mean only with his garment [perfumed], but on his body [it is permitted] because it removes [the odour of] perspiration. Rab Pappa said : [To perfume] his hair is like [perfuming] his garment; but some declare that it is like [perfuming] his body[2]. 

He should not go out alone at night, because of the suspicion [it may arouse] ; and they mean only where he has no fixed hour [for going out at night], but if he have a fixed hour, it will be well known that he goes out as is his usual custom[3]. 

He should not go out with patched sandals. This supports the statement of R. Hiyya b. Abba who said : It is a disgrace for a disciple of the wise to go out with patched sandals[4]. But it is not so; for R. Hiyya b. Abba went out thus! Mar Zotra b. [5] Rab Nahman said : It means with a patch on top of a patch, and it refers only to the legging ; but as for the sole, we have no objection. And even in the case of the legging, it means only when walking by the way ; but as for wearing such in the house, we have no objection. It further refers to the days of Summer, but in the days of Winter we have no objection[6]. 

He should not converse with a woman in the street. Rab Hisda said : Even if it be his wife[7]. There is a teaching to the same effect : Even if it be his wife, or his daughter, or his sister, because everybody is not well acquainted with his female relations. 

He should not recline in the company of 'Amine ha'ares. What is the reason ? He may perhaps be induced to be drawn after them. 

He should not be the last to enter the House of Study; because such an one is called "a transgressor[8]." 

Some declare he should not walk with a big stride. For the teacher has said : A big stride takes away one five hundredth part of the light of a man's eyes. What is the remedy for if ? He may restore it [by drinking the wine of] Sanctification on the [Sabbath] night. 

He should not walk with an erect carriage. For the teacher has said: He who walks with an erect carriage, even a distance of four cubits, is as though he pushed against the feet of the Shekinah[1]; for it is written, "The whole earth is full of His glory" 

(Is. vi. 3). 

[[fol. 44a]] MISHNAH VII 

If they set before him salted food first and with it bread, he says the benediction over the salted food and this makes it unnecessary over the bread, because the bread is something accessory to it. This is the general rule : In the case of a food which is the principal thing and together with it is something accessory, the benediction is to be uttered over the former and there is no necessity for a benediction over the latter. 

GEMARA 
Is there any salted food which is the principal thing and the bread, accessory ? Rab Aha b. Rab 'Awira said in the name of Rab Ashe[2] : They refer to one who eats the fruits of Gennesareth[3]. Rabbah b. Bar Hannah said : At the time we were following R. Johanan to eat the fruits of Gennesareth, when we were a hundred in number we used each to take ten for him, and when we were ten we used each to take a hundred for him ; and a basket of the capacity of three Saot could not hold a hundred of them. But he ate them all and swore that he had tasted no food. No food, dost imagine? But say, [He meant that he had eaten no] satisfying meal. R. Abbahu ate so many of them that a fly would glide down his face[4]. R. Ammi and R. Assi ate so many of them that their hair fell out. R. Simeon b. Lakish ate so many of them that he began to rave. R. Johanan reported this to the household of the Prince, and R. Judah the Prince sent officials after him and brought him to his house. 

When Rab Dimai came [from Palestine] he said : Jannaeus the king[1] had a city on the king's mountain[2] from which they obtained sixty myriad basins of salted fish[3] for the hewers of the fig-trees from one Sabbath-eve to the next[4]. When Rabin came he said : Jannaeus the king had a tree on the king's mountain from which they took down forty Saot of young pigeons[5] monthly from three broods. When R. Isaac came he said : There was a city in the land of Israel named Gofnit[6] in which were eighty pairs of brothers of a priestly family married to eighty pairs of sisters of a priestly family[7] ; and the Rabbis searched from Sura to Nehardea[8] and could not find [a similar case] with the exception of the daughters of Rab Hisda who were married to Rammi b. Hamma and Mar 'Ukba b. Hamma ; but although the women belonged to a priestly family, the men did not. 

Rab said : A meal without salt is no meal[9]. R. Hiyya b. Abba said in the name of R. Johanan : A meal without some acrid substance[10] is no meal. 

MISHNAH VIII 

If one ate grapes, figs or pomegranates, he says after them the three benedictions. These are the words of Rabban Gamaliel ; but the Sages declare : One benediction which is an abstract of three. R. 'Akiba says : Even if one eats [nothing but] boiled vegetables and makes a meal of it, he pronounces thereover the three benedictions. If one drinks water to slake his thirst, he says the benediction "...By Whose word all things exist "; R. Tarphon says : "...Who createst many living beings and their wants." 

GEMARA 

What is Rabban Gamaliel's reason[1]? Because it is written, "A land of wheat and barley and vines and fig-trees and pomegranates" (Deut. viii. 8), and it is written, "A land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness" (ibid. v. 9), and it is written "And thou shalt eat and be satisfied, and bless the Lord thy God" (ibid. v. lO)[2]. And the Rabbis[3]? [The reference to] the "land"[4] interrupts the subject-matter[5]. But for Rabban Gamaliel likewise [the reference to] the "land" interrupts the subject-matter[6] ! He requires that to exclude the case of one who chews wheat[7].
 
R. Jacob b. Iddi said in the name of R. Hannina : Over any food which belongs to the five species[8], before partaking thereof one says the benediction "...Who createst various kinds of foods," and afterwards one benediction which is an abstract of three. 

Rabbah b. Mari said in the name of R. Joshua b. Levi : Over any food belonging to the seven species[9], before partaking thereof one says the benediction "...Who createst the fruit of the tree," and afterwards one benediction which is an abstract of three. 

Abbai asked Rab Dimai : What is the one benediction which is an abstract of three? He replied : For the fruit of the tree it is[10]: "[Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe,] for the tree and the fruit of the tree and for the produce of the field; for the desirable, good and ample land which Thou didst give as an heritage unto our fathers, that they might eat of its fruits and be satisfied with its goodness. Have mercy, O Lord our God, upon Israel Thy people, upon Jerusalem Thy city, upon Thy Sanctuary and altar. Rebuild Jerusalem, Thy holy city, speedily in our days ; lead us up thither and make us rejoice in its rebuilding[1] ; for Thou art good and beneficent unto all." For the five species it is : "[Blessed... universe] for the sustenance and the nourishment, and for the produce of the field[2]," etc. And the benediction is concluded : "[Blessed art Thou, O Lord,] for the land and for the sustenance[3]." 

In the case of fruit[4] how should the benediction conclude ? When Rab Dimai came he said : Rab concluded on the New Moon thus, "Blessed [art Thou, O Lord] Who sanctifiest Israel and the beginnings of the months[5]." So how should it be concluded in this case of fruit ? Rab Hisda said : "[Blessed art Thou, O Lord,] for the land and its fruits." R. Johanan said: "For the land and for the fruits[6]." R. 'Amram[7] said : There is no contradiction, Rab Hisda's wording being customary with us [in Babylon] and R. Johanan's with them [in Palestine]. Rab Nahman b. Isaac objected : They eat and we make the benediction[8] ! Nay, the wording should be reversed ; Rab Hisda said : "For the land and for the fruits" and R. Johanan said : "For the land and its fruits." 

Rab Isaac b. Abdemi said in the name of our teacher[9] : Over [[fol. 44b.]] an egg and various kinds of meat, before partaking thereof one says the benediction "...By Whose word all things exist" and afterwards "...Who createst many living beings" etc. ; but not over vegetables[10]. R. Isaac declared : Even over vegetables, but not over water. Rab Pappa said : Even over water. Mar Zotra acted in accord with Rab Isaac b. Abdemi, and Rab Shimi b. Ashe[11] in accord with R. Isaac. (A mnemonic for thee is : One in accord with two and two in accord with one[1].) Rab Ashe said : When I think of it, I act in accord with them all[2].
 
We have a Mishnaic teaching : Everything that requires a benediction after it requires one before it ; but there are things which require a benediction before but not after. This is quite right for Rab Isaac b. Abdemi, since it is to exclude vegetables, and for R.Isaac to exclude water ; but for Rab Pappa what is it to exclude ? It excludes the commandments[3]. But for the sons of the West[4] who on removing the Tefillin say the benediction, "[Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe] Who didst sanctify us with Thy commandments and commanded us to observe Thy statutes," what is it to exclude ? Fragrant odours. 

R. Jannai said in the name of Rab[5] : Any food [whose minimum standard is the size of] an egg, the egg is superior to it [as nourishment]. When Rabin came he said : Better is a light-roasted[6] egg than six measures of fine flour. When Rab Dimai came he said[7]: Better is a light-roasted egg than six [measures of fine flour] and a hard-baked egg than four. Of a boiled egg [it is said], any food [whose minimum is the size of] an egg, the egg is superior to it [as nourishment] with the exception of meat. 

R. 'Akiba says : Even if one eats boiled vegetables, etc. 

Is there any boiled vegetable which is to be regarded as nourishment? Rab Ashe said: It refers to cabbage-stalks.
 
Our Rabbis have taught : Milt is good for the teeth but bad for the bowels ; horse-beans are bad for the teeth but good for the bowels. All raw vegetables make the complexion pale ; anything not fully grown makes the body shrink ; every living being[8] restores the soul and everything near to the soul[9] restores the soul. Cabbage [is good] as nourishment and beet as a remedy ; but woe to the body[10] through which vegetables keep constantly passing[11]. 

The master said above, "Milt is good for the teeth but bad for the bowels." What is the remedy? Let him chew it and then throw it away. "Horse-beans are bad for the teeth but good for the bowels." What is the remedy? Let him boil them well and swallow them. "All raw herbs make the complexion pale." R. Isaac said : This refers only to the first meal after blood-letting. R. Isaac also said : It is forbidden to converse with him who has eaten [raw] herbs before the fourth hour of the day[1]. For what reason ? Because of the evil odour. R. Isaac also said : It is forbidden for a man to eat raw herbs before the fourth hour of the day. Amemar, Mar Zotra and Rab Ashe were sitting [at table], and they set before them raw herbs before the fourth hour. Amemar and Rab Ashe ate, but not so Mar Zotra. They said to him, "What is thy opinion ? Is it because R. Isaac declared : It is forbidden to converse with him who has eaten [raw] herbs before the fourth hour of the day on account of the evil odour ? Behold we have eaten, and still thou talkest with us!" He replied, "I agree with the other statement of R. Isaac, viz. : It is forbidden for a man to eat raw herbs before the fourth hour of the day." 

"Anything not fully grown makes the body shrink." Rab Hisda said : Even a young kid worth a Zuz ; and it only refers to that which is not a fourth [of its full natural size], but if it be a fourth, we have no objection. "Every living being restores the soul." Rab Pappa said : Even the small fishes from the swamps. "Everything near to the soul restores the soul." Rab Aha b. Jacob said : This is the neck. Raba[2] said to his attendant, "When thou bringest me a piece of meat, take the trouble and obtain it from a place near to where the benediction is pronounced[3]." "Cabbage is good as nourishment and beet as a remedy." Is the cabbage good as food but not as a remedy ? Lo, there is a teaching : Six things cure a man from his sickness and their remedy is [an efficacious] remedy, viz.: Cabbage, beet, a decoction of dry poley[4], the maw, the womb and the large lobe of the liver! But say : Cabbage is good also as nourishment[5]. "Woe to the body through which vegetables keep constantly passing." But it is not so! For lo, Raba[6] said to his attendant, "If thou seest vegetables in the market, never ask me, With what wilt thou wrap thy bread?" Abbai said : [It means vegetables] without meat; and Raba said : Without wine[1]. It has been reported: Rab said: [It means vegetables] without meat; Samuel said: Without wood[2]; and R. Johanan said : Without wine. Raba asked Rab Pappa the brewer, "We break [the harmful effects of vegetables] by means of meat and wine ; but you who do not use much wine, how do you break it ?" He replied, "With chips of wood[2]." For example, Rab Pappa's[3] wife, when cooking it, broke [its harmful effects] with eighty twigs of Persian trees. 

Our Rabbis have taught : A small salted fish sometimes kills on the seventh, the seventeenth and twenty-seventh, and some say the twenty-third[4] day. This applies only to the case where it has been roasted but not roasted [thoroughly] ; but if it has been well-roasted, there is no objection. And when it has been well-roasted, it only applies to the case where one does not drink beer after it ; but if he drinks beer after it, there is no objection. 

If one drinks water to slake his thirst, etc. 

What does this intend to exclude[5] ? Rab Iddi b. Abin said : [[fol. 45 a.]] To exclude him whom a piece of food chokes[6]. 

R. Tarphon says : "...Who createst many living beings and their wants." 

Raba b. Rab Hanan[7] said to Abbai (another version : to Rab Joseph) : How is the Halakah? He replied : Go and see how the people act[8]. 

May we return unto thee : What benediction do we say !
