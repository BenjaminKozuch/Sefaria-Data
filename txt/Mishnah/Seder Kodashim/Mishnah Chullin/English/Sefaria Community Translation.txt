Chapter 1

Anyone [may] slaughter -  and his slaughter is valid - except a deafmute, a <i>shoteh</i> (a person who exhibits signs demonstrating a lack of ability to think clearly) or a minor, lest they spoil the slaughter. But all who slaughter while others watch them, their slaughter is valid. The slaughter of a non-Jew is a <i>nevelah</i> (an improperly slaughtered animal of a permitted species) renders impure through lifting. One who slaughters at night, and so too a blind person who slaughters, his slaughter is valid. One who slaughters on Shabbat, or on Yom Kippur, even though he is liable for death, his slaughter is valid.
If one slaughters with a hand sickle, a flint stone, or with a reed, his slaughter is valid. All [may] slaughter, they may slaughter at any time, and they may slaughter with anything  except a reaping sickle, a saw, teeth, or a finger nail, because they strangle. One who slaughters with a reaping sickle along the direction [of the teeth], Beit Shammai invalidate, but Beit Hillel validate. If its teeth were smoothed, behold it is like a knife.
One who slaughters through the ring of the windpipe and left on it a thread's breadth around the whole of it [the circumference], his slaughter is valid. Rabbi Yose ben Rabbi Yehuda says, "[Even] a thread's breadth around the majority of it."
One who slaughters from the sides, his slaughter is valid. One who performs <i>melikah</i> (slaughtering method used for bird sacrifices, employing the thumbnail instead of a knife) from the sides, his <i>melikah</i> is invalid. One who slaughters from the back of the neck, his slaughter is invalid. One who performs <i>melikah</i> from the back of the neck, his <i>melikah</i> is valid. One who slaughters from the throat, his slaughter is invalid. One who performs <i>melikah</i> from the the throat, his <i>melikah</i> is invalid, for the whole back of the neck is valid for <i>melikah</i>, and the whole throat is valid for slaughtering. As a result, [that which is] valid regarding slaughter is invalid regarding <i>melikah</i> and [that which is] valid regarding <i>melikah</i> is invalid regarding slaughter.
[That which is] valid regarding pigeons is invalid regarding turtle-doves. [That which is] valid regarding turtle-doves is invalid regarding pigeons. [At] the beginning of yellowing [of the feathers] with either this or that, they [become] invalid [as sacrifices].
[That which is] valid for the <i>parah [adumah]</i> (a red heifer whose ashes whose ashes are added to specially drawn water, the sprinkling of which purifies those rendered impure from corpses) is invalid for the <i>eglah [arufah]</i> (a calf whose neck is broken to atone for an unsolved murder). [That which is] valid for the <i>eglah</i> is invalid for the <i>parah</i>. [That which is] valid for <i>kohanim</i> (member of the priestly caste, a subgroup of tribe of Levi, which is uniquely responsible for maintaining and carrying out the sacrificial services in the Temple) is invalid for levites. [That which is] valid regarding levites is invalid regarding <i>kohanim</i>. [That which is] pure for earthenware vessels is impure for all the [other] vessels. [That which is] pure for all the [other] vessels is impure for earthenware vessels. [That which is] pure for wooden vessels is impure for metal vessels. [That which is] pure for metal vessels, is impure for wooden vessels. The [conditions] which obligate for bitter almonds [regarding tithes] exempt for sweet ones. Those which obligate for sweet almonds exempt for bitter ones.
The <i>tamad</i>, while it has not yet fermented, is not purchased with the money of <i>ma'aser [sheni]</i> (the second tithe of produce, which must be taken to Jerusalem and consumed there) and invalidates a  <i>mikveh</i> (water collected by natural means used to cleanse ritual impurity). From when it has fermented it may be purchased with the money of <i>ma'aser [sheni]</i>, and does not invalidate a <i>mikveh</i>. Brothers who are partners, when they are obligated for the <i>kolbon</i> (a surcharge added to the half a shekel given to the Temple due to exchanging a full shekel), they are exempt regarding <i>ma'aser behema</i> (the tithe of every tenth animal from the flock or cattle, which is brought as a sacrifice). When they are obligated for <i>ma'aser behema</i> they are exempt for the <i>kolbon</i>. Any place there is a right of sale (for a father with his daughter), there are no fine (for raping or seducing the daughter).  And any place there is a fine, there is no  right of sale. Any place there is <i>mi'un</i> (the refusal to remain in a marriage by a minor,orphaned girl who was married off by her mother or brothers; the marriage is ended without a divorce), there is no <i>chalitzah</i> (the ceremony performed to release a widow of a childless man from the obligation of Levirate marriage).  And any place where there is <i>chalitzah</i>, there is no <i>mi'un</i>. When the cornet is sounded [on the eve of Shabbat] no <i>havdalah</i> is said, and when <i>havdalah</i> is said, the cornet is not sounded. When a festival falls out on the eve of the Shabbat the cornet is sounded, and <i>havdalah</i> is not said. If [it falls out] on the day after Shabbat, <i>havdalah</i> is said, but the cornet is not sounded. How is <i>havdalah</i> said [when a festival falls out on the day after Shabbat]? [Blessed art thou, etc.] "who makes a distinction between holy and holy". R. Dosa says, "who makes a distinction between the greater and lesser [degrees of] holiness."

Chapter 2

One who slaughters one [of the trachea or esophagus] for a bird, and both for cattle, his slaughter is valid. The majority of one [of the trachea or esophagus] is like [all of] it. Rabbi Yehuda says, "[Not] until he cuts the jugular veins." [If he cut] one half of one for a bird, and one and a half for cattle, his slaughter is unfit. [If he cut] the majority of one for a bird, and the majority of two for cattle, his slaughter is valid.
One who slaughters two heads in one, his slaughter is valid. When two hold the knife and slaughter, even if one [held it] at the top and one at the bottom, their slaughter is valid.
If he decapitated the head in one blow, it is invalid. If he was slaughtering and he decapitated the head in one blow, if the knife has a neck's width [outside of the neck], it is valid. If he was slaughtering and cut off two heads in one blow, if the knife has a neck's width [outside of the cut necks], it is valid. What case is being discussed? At a time when he extends [the knife] but does not bring it back [down the throat], or he brings it back but does not extend. But, if he extended and brought it back, any amount [of knife], even with a surgeon's knife, is valid. A knife that falls and slaughters, even if it slaughtered in its [proper] way, [the slaughter] is invalid, for it is said "Then you shall slaughter and then you shall eat." (Deuteronomy 27:7) That which you slaughter you eat. If the knife fell, and he picked it up; or his clothes fell and he picked them up; or he sharpened the knife and became weary; then his fellow came and slaughtered: if he delayed the amount of time it takes to slaughter, [the slaughter] is invalid. Rabbi Shimon said, "If he delayed the amount of time it takes to investigate [the knife]."
He cut the esophagus and tore the trachea; or cut the trachea and tore the esophagus; or cut one of the them and left it until it dies; or he hid the knife under the second and ripped it, Rabbi Yishbav says, “It is a <i>nevelah</i> (an improperly slaughtered animal of a permitted species).” Rebbi Akiva says, “It is a <i>tereifah</i>  (an animal with a mortal condition such that it would die within one year). A general principle said by Rabbi Yishbav in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua: “Anything invalidated in its slaughtering is a <i>nevelah</i>; anything where its slaughtering is proper, but another issue cause it to become invalid is a <i>terefah</i>.” Then Rabbi Akiva agreed with him.
One who slaughters cattle, a wild animal, or a bird, and no blood came out, they are valid are are eaten with unclean hands for they are not made fit to contract impurity by blood. ...
One who slaughters a gravely ill animal, Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says, “As long as it struggles with its fore and hind leg.” Rabbi Eliezer says, “It is sufficient if it squirts [blood].” Said Rabbi Shimon, “Even one who slaughters at night and the next day gets up and finds the walls covered in blood, it is valid, for it squirted [blood] and is like the principle of Rebbi Eliezer.” The Sages say, “Until it struggles with either its fore or hind leg, or until shakes its tail, whether for small cattle or big cattle.” Small cattle which extended its fore leg but did not withdraw it is invalid, for that is only the leaving of its life. What case is being discussed? When it is previously held to be gravely ill. But if it was previously held to be healthy, even if did not have one of these signs, it is valid.
One who slaughters for a non-Jew, his slaughtering is valid. And Rabbi Eliezer declares it invalid. Said Rabbi Eliezer, “Even if  he slaughtered it so that the non-Jew will eat from the edge of its liver, it is invalid, for the usual thought of a non-Jew is towards  idolatry.” Said Rabbi Yose, “These matters are [solved by] an a fortiori argument. Just as in a place where thought invalidates for <i>mukdashim</i> everything only follows the work, in a place where thought does not invalidate for <i>chulin</i> should it not be the rule that everything only follows the slaughtering?”
One who slaughters for the sake of mountains, for the sake of valleys, for the sake of seas, for the sake of rivers, for the sake of deserts, his slaughter is invalid. [If] two grasp the knife and slaughter, one for the sake of one from all of these and one for the sake of something fitting, his slaughter is invalid.
We may not slaughter into seas, nor into rivers, nor into vessels. But one may slaughter into a pool of water, and onto vessels [when] on a boat. We do not slaughter into a pit at all, but one makes a pit within his house so that the blood will go into it. But in the marketplace one may not do as such so as to not imitate the heretics.
One who slaughter for the sake of an <i>olah</i> (offering that is entirely burnt), for the sake of other sacrifices, for the sake of an <i>ashma talui</i> (an offering brought to expiate a sin one is unsure of committing), for the sake of the <i>pesach</i> sacrifice, for the sake of a thanksgiving offering, his slaughtering is invalid; and Rabbi Shimon validates. [If] two hold the knife and slaughter, one for the sake of one of these and one for the sake of something fitting, his slaughter is invalid. One who slaughters for the sake of a sin offering, for the sake of a guilt offering, for the sake of a first born offering, for the sake of <i>ma’aser</i>, for the sake of <i>temurah</i>, his slaughter is valid. This is the general principle: anything which is vowed or voluntarily offered, when one slaughters for its sake it is forbidden. For that which is neither vowed or voluntarily offered, when one slaughters for its sake it is fit.

Chapter 3

These are the <i>terefot</i> (an animal with a mortal condition such that it would die within one year) for cattle: a puncture of the esophagus; and a split [widthwise] of the trachea; the membrane of the brain is perforated; the heart chamber is perforated; the spine is broken and its chord is split; the liver is removed and none of it remains; the lung which is punctured or missing - Rebbi Shimon says, "Only when it is punctured through the bronchial tubes;" the stomach was pierced; the abomasum (the final stomach) was pierced; the gall-bladder was pierced; the small intestines were pierced; the inner rumen (the first stomach) was pierced; or if the majority of the outer was ripped - Rabbi Yehuda says, "[For] the larger [animals] a <i>tefach</i> (a specific unit of length), and the smaller [animals] the majority); the omasum or reticulum (stages three and two in the stomach) which were punctured to the outside; fallen from a roof; most of its ribs were fractured; and clawed by a wolf. Rabbi Yehuda says, "Clawed by a wolf for small cattle and clawed by a lion for large cattle. Clawed by a hawk for a small bird and clawed by a large bird for a large bird." This is the general rule: anything where something similar to it cannot live is a <i>terefah</i>..
These are acceptable for cattle: the trachea was perforated or if it was split [legthwise]. Up to how much can it lack? Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says, "Up to an Italian <i>issar</i> (a specific unit of money)." The skull is chipped but the membrane of the brain is not perforated; the heart is perforated but not through to its chamber; the spine is broken but its chord is not split; the liver is removed but an olive's size of it remains; the omasum and reticulum which we perforated from this to the other; the spleen is removed; the kidneys are removed; the lower jaw is is removed; its womb is removed; dried up [lungs] at the hands of Heaven. The flayed [animal], Rabbi Meir declares valid, but the Sages invalidate.
These are the <i>terefot</i> for a bird: a puncture of the esophagus; a split [widthwise] of the trachea; a weasel hit it on the head in a place that makes it a <i>terefah</i>; the gizzard is perforated; the small intestines are perforated; it fell into a fire and its intestines were scorched - if they are green, they are invalid, if they are red they are valid; trampled on, torn on a wall, or cattle ran over it and it jerks and then waits twenty-four hours and one slaughtered it, it is valid.
The following are valid for a bird: the trachea was perforated or it was split [lengthwise]; a weasel hit it on its head in a place which does not make it a <i>terefah</i>; the crop was perforated - Rebbi says, "Even if it was removed;" its insides came out but they were not perforated; its wing was broken; it leg was broken; its wing feathers were plucked. Rabbi Yehuda says, "If the down was removed, it is invalid."
Congestion of blood, one that inhaled smoke, one that became sick from cold, one that ate oleander; one that ate chicken feces or drank poor water is fit. [If] it ate poison or a snake bit it, it is permissible in regards to [the category of] <i>terefah</i>, and forbidden in regards [to the category of] endangering lives.
The signs of cattle and a wild animal are stated from the Torah, but the signs of a bird are not stated. But the Sages said, "Any bird which attacks [prey] is impure. Any that has an extra digit, a crop, and gizzard that peels [away] is pure." Rabbi Eliezer ben Rebbi Tzadok says, "Every bird which parts its toes is impure."
And for locusts, any which has four legs, four wings, and jointed legs, and its wings cover the majority of it [is valid]. Rabbi Yose says, "And [if] its name is 'locust.'" And for fish, any which has a fin and scales. Rabbi Yehuda says, "Two scales and one fin." These are they [types] of scales: those attached to it. And fins: the ones by which it swims. 

Chapter 4

[If] an animal has difficulty giving birth, and the fetus protruded its fore-leg and withdrew it, [the fetus] is permitted for eating. [If] it protruded its head, even if it withdrew it, behold it is as if it was born. A cut piece from the fetus in its womb is permitted for eating; from the spleen or kidney is forbidden for eating. This is the general rule is: anything which is part of its [the animal giving birth’s] body is forbidden. That which is not of its body is permitted.
An animal pregnant with its firstborn which is having difficulty giving birth, one [may] cut limb by limb [from the fetus] and cast it to the dogs. [If] the majority of it protruded, it must be buried and [the mother] is exempt from [laws regarding] the firstborn. 
An animal whose fetus died within its womb and the shepherd placed his hand inside and touched it, whether it is an impure animal or pure animal, he is pure. Rabbi Yose the Galilean says, “For an impure [animal], he is impure, but for a pure [animal], he is pure.”  A woman whose fetus died in her womb and the midwife placed her hand inside and touched it, the midwife is impure with a seven day impurity, and the mother is pure until the fetus comes out.
“An animal that has difficulty giving birth, and the fetus protruded its fore-leg, someone cut it off, and afterward slaughtered its mother, the flesh [removed from the fetus] is pure. [If] someone slaughtered its mother and afterwards cut [the fore-leg off], the flesh [has the impurity level] of touching a <i>nevelah</i> [an improperly slaughtered animal of a permitted species],” in the words of Rabbi Meir. The Sages say, "[The impurity level] of touching a slaughtered <i>terefah</i> [an animal with a mortal condition such that it would die within one year]. Just as we find for a <i>terefah</i> that its slaughtering purifies it, so too the slaughtering of an animal purifies the [protruding] limb.” Rabbi Meir said to them, "Not so, for if the slaughtering of a <i>terefah</i> renders clean that which is part of its body, [but] does it render clean the limb which is not of its body?” From where is it derived for a <i>terefah</i> that its slaughtering purifies it? An unfit animal is forbidden for eating [and] so too a <i>terefah</i> is forbidden for eating. Just as an impure animal is purified by its slaughter, is a <i>terefah</i> not purified by its slaughter? No. If you say [something] about an unfit animal which did not have a moment of validity, would you say [as such] about a <i>terefah</i> which had a time of validity? Take away what [the argument] you brought. Behold, if it is born as a <i>terefah</i> from the womb, from where would we derive this? [Rather], no. If you say about an unclean animal that for its kind is not [affected] by slaughtering, would you say it for a <i>terefah</i> whose kind [affecting] by slaughtering? Born alive at eight [months], its slaughtering does not render it pure, for its kind is not [affected] by slaughtering.
"One who slaughtered an animal and found within it an eight month old fetus alive or dead, or a nine month old dead fetus, one tears it up so the blood comes out. If one found a nine month old live fetus, it requires slaughtering, and is under the obligation of it and its offspring (the prohibition against killing an animal and its child on the same day)," in the words of Rabbi Meir. But the Sages say, "The slaughtering of the mother purifies it [the fetus]." Rabbi Shimon Shazuri says, "Even [if the fetus reached the age of] eight years and is plowing in the field, the slaughtering of its mother purifies it." [If] one ripped apart [an animal] and found in it a nine-month old [fetus], it requires slaughter, for its mother was not slaughtered.
An animal whose legs were cut off from the knee and below is fit; from the knee and above it is unfit, and so too when the junction of the sinews is interrupted. [If] the bone was broken, if most of the flesh is extant, its slaughter purifies it. But if not, its slaughter does not purify it.
[If] one slaughtered an animal and found a placenta inside of it, a hearty person may eat it. And it does not contract impurity as food, nor as the impurity of <i>nevelot</i>. [If] one regarded it [as edible], it contracts impurity as food, but not the impurity of <i>nevelot</i>. A placenta, some of which protruded, is forbidden to be eaten. It [the protruding placenta] is the sign of an offspring for a woman and the sign of an offspring for an animal. [For] an animal which has never given birth and miscarried a placenta, [the placenta] is cast to the dogs. For <i>mukdashim</i> [animals or food which are holy and not available for general consumption] it is buried. And we do not bury it at a cross roads and we do not hang it up in a tree, due [to the prohibition against following] the ways of the Amorites..

Chapter 5

<i>Oto ve'et beno</i> [the prohibition against killing an animal and its offspring on the same day] applies whether in the land [of Israel] or outside the land, within the Temple and not within the Temple, with <i>chulin</i> [animals or food permitted for general consumption] or <i>mukdashim</i> [animals or food which are holy and not available for general consumption]. How [does this work]? One who slaughters <i>oto ve'et beno</i> as <i>chulin</i> outside [of the Temple courtyard], both [slaughters] are valid, and the [slaughterer of the] second receives forty lashes. <i>Kodashim</i> [animals or food which are holy and not available for general consumption] outside [of the Temple courtyard]: the first [slaughterer] is liable for <i>karet</i> [Divinely imposed punishment consisting in severance from Heaven and/or the Jewish people], both [of the animals] are invalid, and both [slaughterers] receive forty lashes. <i>Kodashim</i> inside [the Temple courtyard]: the first [animal] is fit and [the first slaughterer] exempt, and the second [slaughterer] receives forty lashes and [the slaughter] is unfit.
<i>Chulin</i> and [then] <i>kodashim</i>  outside: the first is fit and is exempt, and the second receives forty and is unfit. <i>Chulin</i> and  <i>kodashim</i> inside, both are invalid and the second receives forty. <i>Kodashim</i> and <i>chulin</i> inside the first is fit and is exempt, and the second receives forty and is unfit. <i>Chulin</i> outside and inside, the first is fit and is exempt, and the second receives forty and is unfit. <i>Kodashim</i> outside and inside, the first is liable for <i>karet</i>, both are unfit, and both receive forty. <i>Chulin</i> inside and outside, the first is unfit and exempt, and the second receives forty and is fit. <i>Kodashim</i> inside and outside, the first is fit and exempt, and the second receives forty and is unfit.
One who slaughters [as part of <i>oto ve'et beno</i>] and it is found <i>terefah</i> [an animal with a mortal condition such that it would die within one year], one who slaughters for idolatry, one who slaughters the <i>parah adumah</i> [a red heifer, sacrificed and burned,  whose ashes are added to specially drawn water, the sprinkling of which purifies those rendered impure from corpses], or a <i>shor haniskal</i> [an animal stoned for killing a person by goring or similar means, which is forbidden from consumption even if slaughtered before the stoning], or an <i>eglah arufah</i> [a calf whose neck is broken by elders of the closest town to atone for an unsolved murder], Rabbi Shimon exempts and the Sages obligate. One who slaughters [as part of <i>oto ve'et beno</i>] and it becomes a <i>nevelah</i> [an improperly slaughtered animal of a permitted species] by his hand, one who [kills by] stabbing, one who tears off [the trachea or esophagus] is exempt from [violation of] <i>oto ve'et beno</i>. Two who purchased an animal and its offspring, whoever purchased first slaughters first. If the second went ahead, he is gains the right. One who slaughtered a cow and after that its two offspring, he receives eighty [lashes]. One who slaughtered its two offspring and after that slaughtered it, receives forty. One who slaughtered it and its grand daughter, and after its daughter, receives forty. Sumkhus says, in the name of Rabbi Meir, "He receives eighty." At four periods during the year one who sells an animal to his fellow needs to inform him [either], "Its mother I sold for slaughter," [or], "Its offspring I sold for slaughter." These are them: the eve of <i>shemini atseret</i>, the eve of the first day of <i>pesach</i>, the eve of <i>shavuot</i>, and the eve of <i>rosh hashanah</i>. And in the words of Rabbi Yose HaGelili, even the eve of <i>yom kippur</i> in the Galilee. Said Rabbi Yehuda, "When? At a time when [the seller] doesn't have a gap [between the sales]. But if he has a gap, he does not need to inform him [the buyer]." And Rabbi Yehuda agrees when one sells the mother to a groom and the offspring to the bride that one needs to inform him, since it is known that both will slaughter on one day. 
During these four periods we force the butcher to slaughter against his will. Even an ox worth one thousand <i>dinarim</i> [a specific unit of money], and he only has a buyer for one <i>dinar</i>, we force him to slaughter. Therefore, if it dies, the death [is a monetary loss] for the purchaser. But for the other days of the year, this is not so, and therefore if it dies, the death [is a monetary loss] for the seller.
The one day spoken about for <i>oto ve'et beno</i>, the day follows after the night. This Shimon ben Zoma expounded, "It says in the story of Creation,'One day' (Genesis 1:5), and it says for <i>oto ve'et beno</i>, 'One day' (Leviticus 22:28). Just as for the 'one day' mentioned in the story of Creation the day follows after the night, so too for the 'one day' mentioned in <i>oto ve'et beno</i> the day follows after the night.

Chapter 6

[The law of] covering the blood [after the slaughter of fowl or wild animals] applies in the land [of Israel] and outside of the land, within the Temple and not within the Temple, for <i>chulin</i> [animals or food permitted for general consumption] but not for <i>mukdashim</i> [animals or food which are holy and not available for general consumption]. It applies for wild animals and fowl, whether in possession or not in possession. And it applies to a <i>koi</i> [an animal whose domesticated status is ambiguous], since it is in doubt. And we do not slaughter it on a holiday. And if one did slaughter it, we do not cover its blood.
One who slaughters and it is found to be a <i>terefah</i> [an animal with a mortal condition such that it would die within a year], one who slaughters for idolatry, one who slaughters <i>chulin</i> inside [the Temple courtyard] or <i>kodashim</i> [animals or food which are holy and not available for general consumption] outside [of the Temple courtyard], or a wild animal or bird which was stoned [for killing a person by goring or similar means, which is forbidden from consumption even if slaughtered before the stoning], Rabbi Meir obligates [the covering of the blood], and the Sages exempt. One who slaughters and it became a <i>nevelah</i> [an improperly slaughtered animal of a permitted species] by his hand,  one who [kills by] stabbing, and one who tears off [the trachea or esophagus] is exempt from having to cover..
A deaf-mute, a <i>shoteh</i> [a person who exhibits signs which demonstrate mental deficiency], or a minor who slaughtered and others watched them, are obligated to cover. [If they slaughtered] among themselves, one is exempt [from having to] cover. So too in the matter of <i>oto ve'et beno</i> [the prohibition against killing an animal and its offspring on the same day], where they slaughtered and others watched them, it is forbidden to slaughter [the mother or the offspring] after them. Among themselves, Rabbi Meir permits slaughtering after them, but the Sages prohibit. But they agree that if one slaughtered, one does not receive forty [lashes].
