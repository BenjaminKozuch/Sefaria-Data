Daf 1b



Daf 2a

The Megillah is read on the eleventh, the twelfth, the thirteenth, the fourteenth, and the fifteenth [of Adar], never earlier and never later.
Cities which have been walled since the days of Joshua ben Nun read on the fifteenth; villages and large towns read on the fourteenth, except that villages move the reading up to the day of gathering.
How so?
If the fourteenth [of Adar] falls on Monday, the villages and large towns read on that day and the walled places on the next day.
