....viz., that David did not kill Shimei from whom was descended Mordecai who provoked Haman.
‘And how a Benjamite repaid me’, viz., that Saul did not slay Agag from whom was descended Haman who oppressed Israel. 
R. Johanan said: 
He did indeed come from Benjamin. Why then was he called ‘a Jew’? Because he repudiated idolatry. 
For anyone who repudiates idolatry is called ‘aJew’, as it is written, There are certain Jews1 etc.
