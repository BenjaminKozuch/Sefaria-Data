Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a

MISHNAH: The Megillah is read on the eleventh, the twelfth, the thirteenth, the fourteenth, and the fifteenth [of Adar], never earlier and never later.
Cities which have been walled since the days of Yehoshua ben Nun read on the fifteenth. Villages and large towns read on the fourteenth. The villages, however may [sometimes] push the reading forward to the court day.
How does this work?
If [the fourteenth of Adar] falls on Monday, the villages and large towns read on that day, and the walled places on the next day.
If it falls on Tuesday or Wednesday, the villages push the reading forward to the court day. The large towns read on the day itself, and the walled place on the next day.
If [the fourteenth falls] on Thursday, the villages and large towns read on that day and the walled places on the next day.
If it falls on Friday, the villages push the reading forward to the court day, and the large towns and walled places read on the day itself.
If it falls on Shabbos, the villages and large towns push the reading [of the Megillah] forward to the court day and the walled places read [the Megillah] on the next day.
If it falls on Sunday, the villages push the reading [of the Megilla] forward to the court day. The large towns read on the same day, and the walled cities [read] on the following day. 
GEMARA: "The Megillah is read on the eleventh."
How can this be derived?.
[How can you ask,] ‘Where can this be derived’?
Surely it is as we state further on,
‘The Sages made a concession to the villages, allowing them to push the reading forward to the Court day, so that [they should have leisure to] supply food and water for their brethren in the large towns’?
What we mean [by our question] is this:
Let us see now. All these dates were laid down by the Men of the Great Assembly.  For if you should [deny this and affirm] that the Men of the Great Assembly laid down only the fourteenth and fifteenth, [is it possible that] the [later] Rabbis should have come and annulled a regulation made by the Men of the Great Assembly
seeing that we have learnt
‘One Bais Din cannot annul the ordinances of another unless it is superior to it in number and in wisdom’? Obviously, therefore, all these days must have been laid down by the Men of the Great Assembly, [and therefore we ask], where are they hinted to [in the Tanach]?
Rav Shimon bar Abba said in the name of R' Yochanan:
It says, (Esther 9:31) ‘To confirm these days of Purim in their times.’ [which indicates that] they laid down many ‘times’ for them. 
But this text is required for its literal meaning?
If that were the case, it [the Tanach] could have simply stated ‘at the [appointed] time’. What then is implied by ‘their times’? A large number of ‘times’!
But still I may say that [the expression ‘their’times’] is required,
to indicate that the time of one is not the same as the time of the other?
If that where the case, it [the Tanach] should say [simply], ‘their time’. Why does it say ‘their times’? So that you may infer from this:  All of them [the days]. 
But cannot you say,
that ‘their times’ means ‘numerous times’?
The expression ‘their times’ is to be interpreted in the same way as we should interpret ‘their time’:  Just as ‘their time’ would indicate two [days], so ‘their times’ indicates two [in addition]. 
But why not make these the twelfth and thirteenth?
For the reason given [elsewhere] by Rav Shmuel bar Yitzchak:
The thirteenth is a time of assembly for all[the community], and no special indication is required for it in the text [the Tanach]
We may say here that the thirteenth day is a time of assembly and no special indication is required for it in the text. 
But why not say that the sixteenth and seventeenth are meant?
[As it says] (Esther 9:27) ‘And it shall not pass’.
But R' Shmuel bar Nachmani says:
It [the Tanach] says (Esther 9:22) ‘As the days wherein the Jews had rest from their enemies.’  [The expression] ‘the days’ [would have sufficed] and we have ‘as the days’, to include the eleventh and the twelfth.
But cannot I say the twelfth and thirteenth?
Said Rav Shmuel bar Yitzchak:
The thirteenth is a time of assembly for all, and does not require special indication [in the text]. 
But cannot I say the sixteenth and the seventeenth?
It is written, (Esther 9:27) ‘and it shall not pass’.
Why did R' Samuel bar Nachmani not derive the rule from the expression ‘in their times’?
He does not accept the distinction [made above between] ‘time’, ‘their time’ and ‘their times’.
And why did Rav Shimon bar Abba not derive the rule from the expression ‘as the days’?
He can say to you:
This is meant to make the rule apply to future generations. 
Rava bar Bar Chanah said in the name of R' Yochanan
This [rule stated in the Mishnah] is the ruling of R. Akiva - the anonymous authority, who draws the distinction between ‘time’, ‘their time’ and ‘their times’. 
The Megilla is only to be read on the proper day. 
The following was adduced in refutation of this:
R' Yehuda said: 'When does this rule apply? When the years are properly fixed and Israel resides upon their own soil.'
But in these days, since people reckon from it, the Megillah is to be read only on the proper day.
Which opinion is R’ Yehuda following?
Shall I say he follows the opinion of R’ Akiva? This cannot be, because [according to him] the regulation is in force in these days also.
It must be then that he follows the Rabbis, and [even according to them]  we read [on the other days] at any rate when the years are properly fixed and Israel reside on their own soil!
Is this not a refutation of R’ Yochanan?
It is.
Rava bar Bar Chunah said in the name of R' Yochanan
'This rule follows the ruling of R’ Akiva - the anonymous authority.'
But the Sages say:
'In these days, since people reckon from it, we read it only on the proper day.'
It has been taught to the same effect
Rabbi Yehuda Says:
'When does this rule hold good? When the years are properly fixed and Israel reside upon their own soil, but in these days, since people reckon from it, it is read only on the proper day.'
Rav Ashi noted a contradiction between the two statements of R' Akiva.

Daf 2b



Daf 3a



Daf 3b

This teaches that he spent the night in the 'depths' of halakhah.
And Rav Shumel bar Unya said:
Torah study is greater than offering the daily sacrifices, as it says:  "I have come now".
There is no difficulty.
This is for many and that is for one.
And that of the one is light?
For it is taught:
During a festival, women may sing a dirge, but may not clap.
Rabbi Yishmael says:
If they are close to the bier they may clap.
On Rosh Chodesh, Chanukah, or Purim they may sing dirges and clap on any of these [days], but they may not wail.
Rabbah bar Huna said:
The festival does not come before a Torah scholar, and not any of Chanukah or Purim.
The honor of Torah of which you speak:  Honor of Torah of an individual is heavy; study of Torah by an individual is light.
Rava said:
It is clear to me;
[that of Temple] service and Megillah reading, reading the Megillah is preferable; [this is] from Rabbi Yose bar Chanina.
[Of] Torah study and Megillah reading, reading the Megillah is preferable since those of the house of Rabbi relied [on Rabbi Yose].
[Of] Torah study and the Mitzvah of the Dead (burying an unattended corpse), the Mitzvah of the Dead is preferable, as it was taught:
Torah study is ceased to bring out the dead [for burial] and to bring in a bride [to the place of her wedding].
[Of Temple] service and the Mitzvah of the Dead, the Mitzvah of the Dead is preferable from [the phrase] "or for his sister" (Numbers 6:7).
For it was taught:
"Or for his sister".  What does [it] teach?
Here is one who was going to slaughter his Pesach offering or going to circumcise his son and he heard that a relative of his had died.  Should he defile himself?  You said:
He should not become defiled.
Then if he should not defile himself for his sister, should he also not defile himself for an unattended corpse?  Thus ["for his sister"] teaches:
He should not defile himself for his sister, but he should defile himself for an unattended corpse.
Rava asks:
[Between] reading the Megillah and the Mitzvah of the Dead, which one of these is preferable?
Reading the Megillah is preferable because it spreads the miracle?  Or perhaps the Mitzvah of the Dead is preferable because it honors life?
After inquiring, [Rava] answered it:
The Mitzvah of the Dead is preferable.
For Master said:
Honoring life is so great that it overrides a negative deed that is in the Torah.
Our text says:  Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:
A wall city and all that is near it and all that is seen with it is included with the walled city.
It was taught:
A nearby [town] even though it is not seen, and a visible [town] even though it is not near.
We understand seen though not near.  It is found, for example, with dwelling places on top of a hill.
But near though not visible?  How is that found?
Rabbi Yirmiyah said:
One that is situated in a wadi.
Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:
A (walled) city that was initially settled [without walls] and then was surrounded [by a wall] is treated like a village.
What is the reason?  Because it is written (Leviticus 25:29):  "If a man shall sell a residence in a walled city"; that is, it was surrounded [by a wall] then settled, and not that it was settled and then surrounded.
Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:
A (walled) city in which there are not ten men of leisure is treated like a village.
What does this impart to us?
It teaches us:
What is a large city?  Any in which there are ten men of leisure; fewer than this and it is a village.
It was necessary for him [to teach about] a (walled) city even though [people] happen to come from outside it.
Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:
A (walled) city that was destroy and subsequently (re)settled is treated like a (walled) city.
What is 'destroyed'?
If you say its walls were destroyed, [if it was] (re)settled (walls rebuilt) then 'yes', [if] not (re)settled then 'no'.
And this was taught:  Rabbi Eliezer bar Yose says:
(Leviticus 25:30) "That has a wall".  Even though it does not have [one] now, if it had one before [it is treated as though walled].
Rather,
What is 'destroyed'?  That its ten men of leisure were 'destroyed'.
Rabbi Joshua ben Levi said:

Daf 4a

Lod and Ono and Gai HeHarashim were surrounded by a wall in the days of Joshua bin Nun.
And it was Joshua who built them?
But it was Elpaal who built them as it is written (I Chronicles 8:12):  "The sons of Elpaal were Ever, Misham, and Shamed; he built Ono and Lod and their dependencies."
But, according to your reasoning, Asa built them, as it is written (II Chronicles 14:5):  "Asa built (fortified cities that belonged to Judah)."
Rabbi Elazar said:
These [cities] were surrounded by a wall from the days of Joshua bin Nun.  They were laid waste in the days of the concubine of Gibeah.  Elpaal came [and] built them.  Again they fell down, and Asa came and repaired them.
Also, [reading] precisely, as it is written (II Chronicles 14:6):  "And he said to Judah, 'let us build these cities...'".  The principle is that they were originally cities.  Learn from this.
And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:
Women are bound in the reading of the Megillah since they were in the same miracle.
And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:
[If] Purim occurs on Shabbat, they ask and they study on the subject of the day.
Why the topic of Purim?
Even to Yom Tov (festival day) also, as it was taught:
Moses established for the Israelites that they should ask and study on the subject of the day -- 
the halakhah of Pesach on Pesach, the halakhah of Shavuot on Shavuot, and the halakhah of Sukkot on Sukkot.
It was necessary for him [to state] Purim.
What might you have said?
We should prohibit [lessons on Purim] because of Rabbah.  This informs us.
And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:
A person is bound to read the Megillah at night and to repeat it during the day, as it is written (Psalm 22:3):  "My God, I call out in the day and You do not answer, at night and there is no silence for me."
They thought this [means]
to read it (the Megillah) at night and to teach its Mishnah during the day.
Rabbi Yirmiyah said to them:
It was explained to me by Rabbi Chiya bar Abba.
As people say:
I will go through this explanation and I will repeat it.
It was also stated:  Rabbi Chelbo said in the name of Ulla [of] Biri:
A person is bound to read the Megillah at night and to repeat it during the day as it is said (Psalms 30:13):  "In order that Glory may sing to You and not be silent, Hashem my God, I will thank you for ever."
Except that the villages may move forward [the reading] to the day of gathering.
Rabbi Hanina said:
The sages were 'light' with the villages in moving forward to the day of gathering when they distribute water and food to their brothers that are in the (walled) cities.

Daf 4b

Is this to say the ordinances are for the (walled) cities?
But we have been taught:
If it (Purim) occurs on Monday, villages and large cities read it on that day. So if it is, should they move forward to the day of gathering? (the previous Thursday)
That would be the tenth.
And the Rabbis did not ordain the tenth.
Come and hear:
If it (Purim) occurs on Thursday, villages and large cities read it on that day.
So if it is, should they move forward to the day of gathering, which is the eleventh? (the previous Monday)
From a day of gathering to [another] day of gathering we do not shift.
Come and hear.  Rabbi Yehudah said:
When?  In a place in which gatherings are on Monday and Thursday.  But a place that does not have gatherings on Monday and Thursday there is no reading it (the Megillah) except in its [proper] time.
If you think the ordinance is for the (walled) cities because there are not gatherings on Monday and Thursday; do the (walled) cities suffer loss?
Do not say 'since they distribute water and food', but say
'because they distribute water and food to their brothers who are in (walled) cities'.
How so?  If it occurs on Monday, villages and large cities read it on the day, etc.  What changed in the first portion that it is arranged according to the month, and what changed at the last portion that is is arranged by day?  Since it would reverse them (the days), the portion is arranged by day.
If it falls on Friday, etc.  Our Mishnah follows whom?
Either Rabbi or Rabbi Yose.
Which [saying of] Rabbi?  It was taught:
If it falls on Friday, villages and large cities move forward to the day of gathering and cities surrounded by a wall read it [the Megillah] on that day.
Says Rabbi:
I say that cities do not postpone from their [regular] place, but both of these read it on that day.
What is the reason for the first teaching?
As  is written (Esther 9:27):  "In each and every year."  Since every year cities [read] before walled [cities], here as well cities before walled [cities].
But say:
"In each and every year".  Since every year cities do not postpone from their [regular] place, then here cities did not postpone from their place.
Here it is different because it is not possible.
And what is Rabbi's reason?
"In each and every year".  Since every year cities do not postpone from their [regular] place, then here cities did not postpone from their place.
But say:  "In each and every year".  Since every year cities [read] before walled [cities], then here also cities [read] before walled [cities].
Here it is different because it is not possible.
What Rabbi Yose [statement]?  It was taught:
If it falls on Friday, walled [cities] and villages move forward to the day of gathering, and large cities read it on that day.
Rabbi Yose says:
Walled [cities] are not before cities, but both of these read it on that day.
What is the reason for the first teaching?
It is written (Esther 9:27):  "In each and every year".  Since each and every year cities [read] on the fourteenth, and the time for [cities] is not like the time for [walled cities], then here, cities [read] on the fourteenth, and this time is not like the time of [walled cities].
But say:
"In each and every year":  since each and every year walled [cities] are not before cities, then here walled [cities] are not before cities.
Here it is different because it is not possible.
What is the reason of Rabbi Yose?  "In each and every year":  since each and every year walled [cities] are not before cities, then here walled [cities] are not before cities.
But say:
"In each and every year":  since each and every year the time for this is not like the time for that, then here the time for this is not like the time for that.
Here it is different because it is not possible.
Does Rabbi think that cities do not shift to the day of gathering?
But it has been taught:
If [Purim] falls on Shabbat, villages move forward to the day of gathering and large cities read on Friday and walled cities [wait] for tomorrow (Sunday).
Rabbi says:
I say that since cities shift from their [regular] place, they shift to the day of gathering.
How is this now?
There, their time is Shabbat, and since they shift (for Shabbat) they can shift [further].
But here their time is Friday.
Whose [statement] does Rabbi Chelbo in the name of Rabbi Huna follow?
[When] Purim falls on Shabbat, everyone shifts to the day of gathering.
Everyone shifts; can you think that?
But there are walled [cities] that do it the next day (Sunday).
Rather, everyone who shifts (at all) shifts to the day of gathering.
Whom?  According to Rabbi.
In any event, all of them confirm that we do not read the Megillah on Shabbat.  What is the reason?
Rabbah said:
Everyone is obligated in reading the Megillah (and in sounding a shofar), but not everyone is expert in reading the Megillah.  [It is] a decree lest he take it (a scroll) in his hand and go to an expert to learn, and carry it four cubits in a public domain.
And it is the reason for the shofar and the reason for the lulav.
Rav Yosef said:
Because the eyes of the poor are raised at the reading of the Megillah.
It was also taught in this manner:
Even though they said that villages move forward to the day of gathering, they collect it (gifts for the poor) on that day and apportion it on that day.
"Even though they said..."?
On the contrary!  It is because they said...
Rather,
since they said that villages move forward to the day of gathering, they collect it on that day and apportion it on that day because the eyes of the poor are lifted at the reading of the Megillah.
But

Daf 5a

rejoicing only applies at its (proper) time.
Rav said:
The Megillah [is read] in its (proper) time; it is read even if alone.  But if not in its time, [only] with ten.
Rav Assi said:
Whether in its time or not in its time, [only] with ten.
There was such a case, and Rav troubled himself to [comply with the ruling] of Rav Assi.
Who said this?  Rav?
Didn't Rav Yehuda son of Rav Shmuel bar Shelat say in the name of Rav:
Purim that occurs on Shabbat -- Friday is its time?
Friday is its time?
But Shabbat is its time!
But was this not what he was saying:
When not [read] in its (proper) time, it is [just like] in its time.  Just as in its time [it can be read] even if alone, then when not in its time [it can be read] even if alone?
No, concerning the reading of the Megillah, [only] with ten.
But what about 'Friday is its time?'  To exclude [the opinion of] Rabbi, who said:  Because cities shift from their places, they shift to the day of gathering.  This comes to teach us that Friday is their (proper) time.
Mishnah.  What is a 'large city'?
Any in which there are ten men of leisure.
Less than that, and it is a village.
Regarding these, [the sages] said: we move forward, but we do not move backward.
But the time of [bringing] wood for the priests, the Ninth of Av [fast], the Festival Offering, and the Assembly move backward and do not move forward.
Even though they said to move forward and to not move backward, it is permitted with a funeral, a fast, and gifts to the poor.
Rabbi Yehudah said:
When [may they move forward]?  A place in which they gather on Monday and Thursday.  But a place in which they do not gather on either Monday or Thursday, they do not read it except in its (proper) time.
Gemara.  It was taught:
Ten men of leisure who are at the synagogue.
Because of these they said:  move forward, but do not move backward.
What is the reason?
Rabbi Abba said in the name of Shmuel:
The verse says (Esther 9:27):  "And it shall not pass...".
Rabbi Abba said in the name of Shmuel:
From where [do we learn] that we do not count days for [reckoning] years?  As it says (Exodus 12:2):  "For the months of the year."  You count months for years, but you do not count days for years.
And the rabbis of Caesaria said in the name of Rabbi Abba:
From where [do we learn] that we do not reckon hours for the months?  As it says (Numbers 11:20):  "Until a month of days".  You reckon days for months, but you do not reckon hours for months.
But the time of [bringing] wood for the priests, the Ninth of Av [fast], the Festival Offering, and the Assembly move backward and do not move forward:
The Ninth of Av [because] we do not move punishment forward.  The Festival Offering and the Assembly are not moved forward because the time of their obligation has not arrived yet.
It was taught:
The Festival Offering and the entire time of the Festival Offering is moved backward.
The Festival Offering is understandable, because if it falls on Shabbat we move it backward until after Shabbat.
But what is 'the time of the Festival Offering'?
Rav Oshaya said:  This is what he said:
The Festival Offering [occurring] on Shabbat, and the sighting of the burnt offering -- even if it is on [the first day of the] Festival, its (proper) time -- we move the Festival Offering backward.
Who [said this]?  It is Beit Shammai.  For we learned:
[Beit Shammai says]:  One may bring well-being offerings (sh'lamim) on a Festival, but one may not lay hands (s'michah) upon them; no burnt offerings.  But Beit Hillel says:
One may bring well-being offerings and burnt offerings and lay hands upon them.
Rava said:
The Festival Offering may move backward for the entire time of the Festival Offering, but not more.
As we have learned:  
One who does not sacrifice on the first day of the Festival may offer a sacrifice during all of the Festival, even on the last day of the Festival.
If the Festival passed and one did not offer a sacrifice, he does not incur an obligation after it.
Rav Ashi said:
The Festival Offering may move backward during the entire time of the Festival; even Shavuot, which is just one day, may move backward.
As we have learned:
They agree that if Shavuot occurs on Shabbat, the day of slaughter is after Shabbat.
Rabbi Elazar said in the name of Rabbi Chanina:
Rabbi planted a plant on Purim,

Daf 5b

and he bathed at the marketplace of Tzippori on the Seventeenth of Tammuz, and he sought to abolish the Ninth of Av, but they did not agree with him.
Rabbi Abba bar Zavda said in front of him:
Rabbi, the matter was not like this.
Rather,
the Ninth of Av happened to occur on Shabbat, and they shifted it to after Shabbat.  Rabbi said:
Because it has been shifted, let it be [completely] shifted (abolished for the year), but the Sages did not agree.
He read to him (Ecclesiastes 4:9):  "Two are better than one".
And how could Rabbi plant a plant on Purim?
But Rabbi Yosef taught:
Rejoicing and feasting and a festival.  'Rejoicing' teaches that mourning is prohibited.  'Feasting' teaches that fasting is prohibited.  And 'festival' teaches that it is prohibited to do work.
Rather, 
Rabbi was from an open (unwalled) area and [observed] on the fourteenth, and it was the fifteenth when he planted.  Is this so?
But Rabbi was in Tiberias, and Tiberias was surrounded by a wall in the days of Joshua bin Nun.
Rather, Rabbi was in an area [that observed] on the fifteenth, and it was on the fourteenth that he planted.
But was it clear to him that Tiberias was surrounded by a wall in the days of Joshua bin Nun?
It was Hezekiah who read in Tiberias on the fourteenth and on the fifteenth.  He doubted whether it was surrounded by a wall in the days of Joshua bin Nun or not.
For Hezekiah it was doubtful, for Rabbi it was clear.
But [even] if it was clear to him, is it permitted [to plant]?
But it is written in the Scroll of Fasting:
"The fourteenth day and the fifteenth day are the Days of Purim on which there is no mourning."
And Rava said:
It was not necessary except to prohibit the same things on one day as on the other.
These are the words of mourning and fasting, but for work:  one day and no more.
Is this so?
But wasn't it Rav who saw a certain man who was sowing flax on Purim and he cursed him and the flax did not sprout?
There, he was [sowing] on [his] day [of observance].
Rabbah son of Rava said:
You may even say 'on his day'.  They accepted mourning and fasting upon themselves; work they did not accept upon themselves.
Originally it was written (Esther 9:19):  "Rejoicing and feasting and a festival".  Later it was written (Esther 9:22):  "To make them days of feasting and rejoicing".  But 'festival' was not written.
But then Rav... For what reason did he curse that man?
Things that are permitted, others have a custom of prohibiting them.  But in Rabbi's place, it was not the custom.
And if you choose, say:
It was absolutely the custom, and Rabbi planted a 'plant of rejoicing'.
As we learned:
If these [days] pass and they are not answered, they reduce their business in building and planting, in betrothing and marrying.
And it was taught about this:
'Building' [means] 'building for rejoicing'; 'planting' [means] 'planting for rejoicing'.
What is 'building for rejoicing'?  It is one who builds a wedding house for his son.
What is 'planting for rejoicing'?  It is one who plants a royal garden.
The previous text:  Hezekiah read in Tiberias on the fourteenth and on the fifteenth.  He doubted whether [Tiberias] was surrounded by a wall in the days of Joshua bin Nun or not.
Did he really doubt the situation of Tiberias?
For it is written (Joshua 19:35):  "And the fortified cities are Zidim-zar, Hamat, Rakat, and Kinneret."  And it is established that Rakat is Tiberias.
We have the reason that it was doubtful to him:
Because on one side was a 'wall' of the Sea [of Galilee].
If so, why was it doubtful to him?
For certain, that is not a wall,
since it was taught:
(Leviticus 25:30):  "Which has a wall":  not a wall of roofs (houses).  "Surrounded":  excludes Tiberias which has the sea for its wall.
Regarding the houses of a walled city, it was not doubtful to him; however, he doubted the subject of reading the Megillah.
What is 'open' and what is 'surrounded' in the collected writings of the reading of the Megillah?  Because these are exposed and those are not exposed.  And [Tiberias] is also exposed.  Or here:
Because these are shielded and those are not shielded.  And [Tiberias] is also shielded.
Because of this, it was doubtful to him.
Rav Assi read the Megillah in Hutzal on the fourteenth and on the fifteenth [because] he doubted whether it was surrounded by a wall in the days of Joshua bin Nun or not.
There are some who say that Rav Assi said:
This Hutzal, that is of the house of Benjamin, was surrounded by a wall in the days of Joshua.
Rabbi Yochanan said:
When I was young, I said something that I asked of the elders,

Daf 6a

and it was found that I was in agreement [with them].
Hamat is Tiberias.  And why was it called Hamat?  Because of the 'hot springs' of Tiberias.
Rakat is Tzippori.  And why was it called Rakat?  Because it lies above like the bank of a river.
Kinneret is Ginosar.  And why was it called Kinneret?  Because the sweetness of the fruit is like the sound of a lute (or harp).
Rava said:  
Who is there that says Rakat is not Tiberias?
But when a man dies here (Babylonia), there (Tiberias) they mourn for him like this:
"He is great in Sheshach (Babylonia), and he has a name in Rakat."
And when the coffin is taken up there, they mourn him like this:
"Lovers of the remains, dwellers in Rakat, come out and receive the slain of the depths."
When the soul of Rabbi Zera rested, the mourner opened [the eulogy] on him:
The land of Shinar conceived and bore him, but the land of beauty raised up her beloved.  Woe to her, said Rakat, because her precious instrument has been lost.
But (Rabbah) Rava said:
Hamat is the 'hot springs' of Gerar.  Rakat is Tiberias.  Kinneret is Ginosar.  And why was [Tiberias] called Rakat?  Because even the worthless [people] in it are filled with commandments like a pomegranate.
Rabbi Yermiyah said:
Rakat is its name.  And why was it called Tiberias?  Because it sits in the navel (center) of the Land of Israel.
(Rava) Rabbah said:
Rakat is its name.  And why was it called Tiberias?  Because its appearance is good.
Zeira said:
Kitron is Tzippori.  And why was it called Tzippori?  Because it sits on top of the mountain like a bird.
And Kitron is Tzippori?
This Kitron was in the allotment of Zebulun, as it was written (Judges 1:30):  "Zebulun did not disinherit the residents of Kitron or the residents of Nahalol."
And Zebulun was dissatisfied by his measure, as was said (Judges 5:18):  "Zebulun is a people that ground its soul to death...".  What was the reason?  Because "...Naftali was upon the heights of the field."
Said Zebulun before the Holy One, Blessed Be He:
Oh, Great One of the Universe:
To my brothers You have given fields and vineyards, and to me You have given mountains and hills; to my brothers You have given lands, and to me You have given lakes and rivers.
Hashem said to him:
All of them will need you on account of the snails (chilazon), as it was said (Deuteronomy 33:19):  "They shall call peoples to the mountain [because of] the hidden things stored up in the sand."
Rav Yosef taught:
'Hidden things' are the snails (chilazon).  'Stored up' refers to pickled fish(?).  'Sand' is white glass.
He said before Him:
Great One of the Universe:  Who will inform me?
Hashem said to him:
(Deuteronomy 33:19) "There they will offer sacrifices of righteousness."  This sign will be for you:
Anyone who takes from you without compensation will not benefit in his business in any way.
Now, if you reason that Kitron is Tzippori, why was [Zebulun] dissatisfied with his measure?
Because Tzippori is a better section.
And if you say that milk and honey does not flow in it, then Resh Lakish said:
I myself have seen milk and honey flow through Tzippori, and it was sixteen mil by sixteen mil.  (A mil is about 2,000 cubits -- trans.)
And if you say
that it is not as large as the measure of his brothers, then Rabbah bar bar Chanah said in the name of Rabbi Yochanan:
I myself have seen milk and honey flow through all of the land of Israel, and it extends from Be Kubi to fort of Tulbankni, twenty-two parasangs in length and six parasangs in width.  (A parsang is four mil -- trans.)
Even so, fields and vineyards were preferable to him.
Also, evidence [comes from] that which is written (Judges 5:18):  "Naftali was upon the heights of the field."  Learn from this.
Rabbi Abahu said:
(Zephaniah 2:4) "Ekron will be uprooted."  This is Caesaria, daughter of Edom, which sits among the sands.  It was a peg driven into Israel in the days of the Greeks.  But then the Hasmonean dynasty strengthened and prevailed over them, and they called it 'the captured tower of Shir'.
Rabbi Yose bar Hanina said:  Why was it written (Zechariah 9:7):  "I will remove his blood from his mouth and his vermin from between his teeth, and He also remains as our God."?  'I will remove his blood from his mouth'.  This is their High Place.  'Vermin from between his teeth'.  This is their temple for oracles.  'And He also remains as our God.'  These are the synagogues and houses of learning that are in Edom.
(Zechariah 9:7)  "And he will be like a chief in Judah, and in Ekron like a Jebusite."  These are the theaters and circuses that are in Edom, which, in the future, will be where the officers of Judah will teach Torah in public.
Rabbi Yitzhak said:
Leshem is Pamias.  'Ekron will be uprooted.'  This is Caesaria, daughter of Edom, which was a metropolis of kings.
There are those who say 
that kings grew up in it, and there are those who say
that king were appointed from that place.
Caesaria and Jerusalem.  If a person says to you
the two of them were burned down, do not believe [him].  [If] the two of them are settled, do not believe [him].
[If] Caesaria was burned down and Jerusalem is settled, [or] Jerusalem was burned down and Caesaria is settled, believe [him].
As it was said (Ezekiel 26:2):  "Let me be filled with the one who was burned down."
If this one is filled, that one is burned down.
If that one is filled, this one is burned down.
Rav Nachman bar Yitzhak said from this case:
(Genesis 25:23) "One people will be stronger than the other people.
Rabbi Yitzhak said:
Why was it written (Isaiah 26:10):  "Let favor be shown to the wicked, yet he will not learn righteousness."
Said Yitzhak before the Holy One, Blessed Be He:
'Oh, Great One of the Universe, let favor be shown to Esau.'
Said He:
'He is wicked.'
[Yitzhak] said to Him:
'[Esau] has not learned righteousness.'
[Hashem] said to him:
(Isaiah 26:10):  "In the land of uprightness he will deal wrongfully."
[Yitzhak] said to Him:
If so, "he will not behold the majesty of Hashem".
Rabbi Yitzhak said:
Why was it written (Psalms 140:9):  "Grant not, Hashem, the desires of the wicked; his muzzle do not take off, so that they become exalted, selah."
Said Jacob before the Holy One, Blessed Be He:
'Oh, Great One of the Universe, do not grant to Esau, the wicked one, the desire of his heart.'
'Do not take off his muzzle.'  This is 

Daf 6b

Germania of Edom, who, if in any way would go forth, would burn down the entire world.
Rabbi Hama bar Hanina said:
There are three hundred crowned ones in Germania of Edom, and there are three hundred sixty-five prefects in Rome.
And every day there is one [from one group] who encounters one [from the other group], and one slays his fellow, and they would be troubled to raise up a [new] king.
Rabbi Yitzhak said:  If a person says to you,
'I have labored but I did not find', do not believe [him].  [If he says,] 'I did not labor, but I have found', do not believe [him].  [If he says,] 'I have labored and I have found', believe [him].
This is so in the matter of the words of Torah, but with worldly affairs ['finding' requires] assistance from heaven.
And for words of Torah, one may not say this except for sharpening [the mind].  But preserving what one has learned [requires] assistance from heaven.
Rabbi Yitzhak said:
If you see a wicked [man] who is in his hour of laughter, do not contend with him, as is said (Psalms 37:1):  "Do not make yourself angry with evil ones."  And more than that, his paths will be successful, as is said (Psalms 10:5):  "His paths prosper all the time."  And more than that, his judgement will be declared correct, as is said (Psalms 10:5):  "His judgements are far above, out of his sight."  And more than that, he will see [the downfall] of those who hate him, as is said (Psalms 10:5):  "As for all of those who distress him, he will blow at them".
Is this so?
Didn't Rabbi Yochanan say in the name of Rabbi Shimon be Yochai:
It is permitted to contend with the wicked in this world, as is said (Proverbs 28:4):  "Those who abandon Torah will praise wickedness, and those who keep Torah will contend with them"?
And it was taught:  Rabbi Dostai bar Maton said:
It is permitted to contend with the wicked in this world.  And if a person whispers saying, 'Do not make yourself angry with evil ones, and do not become zealous at wrong-doers' -- he whose heart destroys him says this.
But,
'Do not make yourself angry with evil ones' to be like evil ones.  And 'do not become zealous at wrong-doers' to be like wrong-doers.
And it says (Proverbs 23:17):  "Do not let your heart be jealous of those who sin, etc."
There is no difficulty.
This one is about one's own affairs, and that one is about the affairs of heaven.
Or, if you desire, say:
'This one and that one are [both] about one's own affairs', but there is no difficulty.
This one is about one who is perfectly righteous, and that one is about one who is not perfectly righteous.
As Rav Huna said:
Why is it written (Habakkuk 1:13):  "Why do you gaze at treacherous ones and keep silent as the wicked one swallows up one more righteous than he?"  One can swallow up one more righteous than he, but the perfectly righteous he cannot swallow.
Or, if you desire, say:
'In his hour of laughter'; [the situation] has changed.
Ulla said:
Italia of Greece is the great city of Rome.
It is three hundred parsangs by three hundred parsangs.  There are 365 markets (shuks) in it, corresponding to the number of days in the solar [year].  The smallest [market] of them all is the poultry sellers', and it is sixteen mil by sixteen mil.
The king dines each day in one of them.
And one who dwells in it, even though he was not born in it, takes a portion from the king's palace, and the one who was born in it, even though he does not dwell in it, takes a portion from the king's palace.
There are three thousand bathhouses in it, and five hundred windows allow the smoke to rise outside to the wall.
One of its sides is [by the] sea, one of its sides is [by] mountains and hills, one of its sides is a partition of iron, and one of its sides is a sand-field and glens.
Mishnah.  [If] they had read the Megillah in the first Adar, then a leap year was proclaimed that year, they read it [again] in the second Adar.
There is no [difference] between first Adar and second Adar except reading the Megillah and gifts for the poor.
Gemara.  But regarding the order of [Torah] portions, this (Adar I) and that (Adar II) are equal.
Whose Mishnah is this?
Not the First Tanna nor Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yose nor Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.
For it was taught:
[If] they had read the Megillah in the first Adar, then a leap year was proclaimed that year, they read it [again] in the second Adar.  Because all of the commandments which are performed in the second [Adar] are performed in the first [Adar], except reading the Megillah.
Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yose says:
There is no reading it [again] in the second Adar because all commandments that are performed in the second [Adar] are performed in the first [Adar].
Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says in the name of Rabbi Yose:
Even so, they [must] read it [again] in the second Adar because all commandments that are performed in the second [Adar] are not performed in the first [Adar].
This (Adar I) and that (Adar II) are equal regarding the prohibition of mourning and fasting.
Isn't Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel [the same as] the First Tanna?
Rav Pappa said:
There is [disagreement] between them [regarding] the order of [Torah] portions.
The First Tanna avers
that initially [they should be read] in the second [Adar], but if they were done in the first [Adar] they are done, apart from reading the Megillah which, even though they had read it in the first [Adar], they [must] read it [again] in the second [Adar].  And Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yose avers
that even the Megillah should initially be read in the first [Adar].
And Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel avers
that even the order of [Torah] portions, if they were read in the first [Adar], are read [again] in the second [Adar].
Who is [the author]?
If it is First Tanna, gifts are a difficulty.  If it is Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yose, reading the Megillah is also a difficulty.
If it is Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, the order of [Torah] portions is a difficulty.
In reality, it is the First Kamma.  He taught the reading of the Megillah and the law of gifts for the poor, because the one is tied to the other.
And if you choose, say:
In reality, it is Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.  Our Mishnah is lacking [something], and this is what it teaches:
There is no [difference] between the fourteenth of the first Adar and the fourteenth of the second [Adar] except reading the Megillah and gifts [for the poor].  But regarding mourning and fasting both are equal.
However, it does not refer to the order of [Torah] portions.
Rabbi Chanina bar Avin said in the name of Rabbi Yochanan:
The law (halakhah) is that of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, who said it in the name of Rabbi Yose.
Rabbi Yochanan said:
The two of them expounded one verse:
"In each and every year." (Esther 9:21)
Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yose averred:
'In each and every year.'  Just as each and every year Adar adjoins Shevat, then here Adar adjoins Shevat.  And Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel averred:
'In each and every year.'  Just as each and every year Adar adjoins Nissan, then here Adar adjoins Nissan.
We understand the reason that Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yose avers -- that there is no passing over of the commandments.  But what is the reason of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel?
Rabbi Tavi said:  Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel's reason is that adjoining redemption (of Purim) to redemption (of Passover) is preferable.
Rabbi Elazar said:
The reason of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel is that it is written (Esther 9:29):  "To confirm this second letter of Purim."
It is necessary to write:

Daf 7a

'the second' and it is necessary to write:  'in each and every year'.  For if it was from 'each and every year' [only], I might have said this is a difficulty.   Thus this informs us that
'the second' [is necessary].
And if it informed us of 'the second' [only], I might have said from the beginning 'the first and the second'.  Thus we are informed by:
'in each and every year.'
And what does Rabbi Eliezer son of Yose do with 'the second'?
He chooses it for the [lesson] of Rav Shmuel bar Yehudah.  Because Rav Shmuel bar Yehudah said:
In the beginning [Purim] was instituted in Shushan, and only later on [was it instituted] throughout the entire world.
Rav Shmuel bar Yehudah said:
Esther sent to the sages:
'Appoint me for the generations.'
They sent to her:
'You will make zealous the protests against us among the nations.'
She sent to them:
'I am already written about in the Chronicles of the Days of the Kings of Medea and Persia.'...
Rav and Rav Chanina and Rabbi Yochanan and Rav Chaviva taught:
(In all of Order Moed, in all places where there is this pair, Rabbi Yochanan disappears and Rabbi Yonathan enters.)
Esther sent to the sages:
'Write [about] me for the generations.'
They sent to her:
(Proverbs 22:20):  "Did I not write for you three times?"  Three times and not four.
Until they found for it a verse written in the Torah (Exodus 17:14):  "Write this as a memorial in a book."  'Write this' [refers to] what is written here and in Deuteronomy (Mishneh Torah).  'As a memorial' [refers to] what is written in the Prophets.  'In a book' [refers to] what is written in the Megillah.
Like the Tannaim:
'Write this' [refers to] what is written here.  'Memorial' [refers to] what is written in Deuteronomy.  'In a book' [refers to] what is written in the Prophets.  [These are] the  words of Rabbi Yehoshua.
Rabbi Elazar HaModai says:
'Write this' [refers to] what is written here and in Deuteronomy.  'Memorial' [refers to] what is written in the Prophets.  'In a book' [refers to] what is written in the Megillah.
Rav Yehudah said in the name of Shmuel:
[The scroll of] Esther does not defile the hands.
Is it to say that Shmuel avers that Esther was not composed with the Holy Spirit?
Didn't Shmuel say:
'Esther was composed with the Holy Spirit?'
It was composed to be read, but not composed to be written.
They objected:
Rabbi Meir says:
Ecclesiastes does not defile the hands, and [opinion] is  divided concerning Song of Songs.
Rabbi Yose says:
Song of Songs defiles the hands, and [opinion] is divided concerning Ecclesiastes.
Rabbi Shimon says:
Ecclesiastes is from the lenient [rulings] of Beit Shammai and the strict [rulings] of Beit Hillel, but Ruth, Song of Songs, and Esther do defile the hands.
He (Shmuel) said this in accordance with Rabbi Yehoshua.
It was taught:  Rabbi Shimon ben Menasia says:
Ecclesiastes does not defile the hands since it is just the wisdom of Solomon.
They said to him:
Is this alone what [Solomon] said?
Has it not already been said (I Kings 5:12):  "And he spoke three thousand proverbs."?  It also says (Proverbs 30:6):  "Do not add onto his words."
Why 'it also says'?
So that if you say:
The command he said is good, so if he desired he wrote, and if he did not desire he did not write.
Come and hear:  do not add onto his words.
Rabbi Eliezer taught in a Berayta
Esther was written through divine inspiration, as it says (Esther 6:6) "Haman said to himself."
Rabbi Akiva says
Esther was written through divine inspiration, as it says (Esther 2:15) "Esther found favor in the eyes of all who saw her."
Rabbi Meir says
Esther was written through divine inspiration, as it says (Esther 2:22) "The matter became known to Mordechai."
Rabbi Yose ben Durmaskit says:
Esther was composed with the Holy Spirit as is said (Esther 9:10):  "But they did not stretch out their hand toward the booty."
Shmuel said:
If I had been there, I would have made a statement preferable to all of them, as is said (Esther 9:27):  "They established and they accepted."  They established above that which they accepted below.
Rava said:
For all of them there is something objectionable in them except for that of Shmuel; in his there is nothing objectionable.
That of Rabbi Eliezer, his reasoning was that there was no person with whom the king agreed like [Haman], so that when he spoke expansively, he was thinking about himself as he spoke.
That of Rabbi Akiva:  perhaps like Rabbi Elazar, who said:
It teaches that to each and every person she was disguised as one of his own nation.
And that of Rabbi Meir:  perhaps like Rabbi Hiyya bar Abba, who said:
Bigtan and Teresh were two [men] of Tarsis.
And that of Rabbi Yose ben Durmaskit: perhaps soldiers were sent.
That of Shmuel:  sufficient and there is no objection in it.
Ravina said:
It is the same as that which people say:
One pungent pepper is better than a basket full of melons.
Rav Yosef said from this:
(Esther 9:28):  "And these days of Purim will not pass by from the midst of the Jews."  Rav Nahman bar Yitzhak says from this:
"And their remembrance will not cease from their descendants."
And gifts for the poor.
Rav Yosef taught:
(Esther 9:22)  "And sending portions, each to his neighbor."  [This means] two portions for one man.
(Esther 9:22)  "And gifts for the poor."  Two gifts for two persons.
Rabbi Yehuda Nesiah sent to Rabbi Oshaia the flank of a calf that was born third and a bottle of wine.  [Rabbi Oshaia] sent to him:

Daf 7b

You have fulfilled with us, our Rabbi, [the commandment of] sending portions each to his neighbor and gifts for the poor.
Rabbah sent to Mari bar Mar through Abaye a basket filled with dates and a full cup of the flour of dried grain.
Abaye said to him:
Now Mari will say:
If a peasant becomes the king, he does not set down the bowl from his neck.
He sent back to him a basket filled with ginger and a full cup of long peppers.
Abaye said:
Now Master (Rabbah) will say:
I sent to him something sweet and he sent back to me [something] pungent.
Abaye said:
When I went out of Master's house, I was sated. When I arrived there, they brought me sixty plates of sixty types of food and I ate sixty portions of them.
And the last dish they called 'pot roast' and afterward I wanted to chew the plate.
Abaye said:
This is what people say:
'A poor person is hungry and does not know it.'
Or also:
'One can [always] extend [himself] for sweet things.'
Abaye bar Avin and Rabbi Hanina bar Avin used to exchange their meals with each other.
Raba said:
 A man is obligated to mellow oneself [get drunk] until he does not know the difference between 'cursed is Haman' and 'Blessed is Mordechai.'
Raba and Rabi Zeira made a Seudat Purim together. They became mellowed and then Raba arose and slaughtered Rabi Zeira.
The next day he prayed for [divine] mercy and he returned to life. 
The next year, he [Raba] said to him [Rabi Zeira]
"Come and let us make a seudat purim together."  
He [Rabi Zeira] replied, 
"Not every single time does a miracle occur."
Rava said:
[If] one eats a Purim feast at night, he has not fulfilled his obligation.  What is the reason?  It is written (Esther 9:22):  "Days of banquets and rejoicing."
Rav Ashi was sitting before (Rav Kahana).  It grew late and the Rabbis had not come.
He said to him:
What is the reason the Rabbis have not come?
Perhaps they are busily engaged with a Purim feast?  He said to him:
Is it not possible to eat [the feast] at night?
He said to him:
Did Master not hear what Rava said?
A Purim feast that is eaten at night does not fulfill his obligation.
He said to him:
(Rava said that?)
[He said to him:
yes.]
He repeated [the saying] forty times after him until he had put it in his 'pouch' (memory).
Mishnah.  There is no difference between a festival (yom tov) and Shabbat except [regarding] food preparation.
Gemara.  But on the subject of ancillaries for food preparation, this (festival) and that (Shabbat) are equal.
The Mishnah does not follow Rabbi Yehudah.  For it was taught:
There is no difference between a festival and Shabbat, except food preparation.  Rabbi Yehudah permits even ancillaries for food preparation.
What is the reason that the First Tanna?  Scripture says (Exodus 12:16):  "that".  But not 'ancillaries'.
But Rabbi Yehudah (said):
(Exodus 12:16) "for you".  'For you' [means] all that is necessary for you.
Isn't it written 'for you' for the other one also?
[He could answer]:  For you and not for star worshipers; for you and not for dogs.
But isn't it written 'that' for the other one also?
'That' is written and 'for you' is written.  Here it is with the ancillaries that are possible to do the day before a festival.  There it is with ancillaries that are not possible to do the day before a festival.
Mishnah.  There is no difference between Shabbat and Yom Kippur except for this one (Shabbat) a premeditated violation [is punished] by human hands, and for that one (Yom Kippur) a premeditated violation [is punished] by Karet ("cutting off" by a 'divine court').
Gemara.  But on the subject of compensation, this one and that one are equal.
Whose Mishnah [is this]?  It is by Rabbi Nehunia ben Hakanah.
For it was taught:  Rabbi Nehunia ben Hakanah was doing Yom Kippur like Shabbat regarding compensation.
One who [violates] Shabbat will pay with his life but is exempt from compensation; also on Yom Kippur one pays with his life but is exempt from compensation.
We learned in that case:
All whose penalty is Karet who were punished by lashes are exempt from the penalty of Karet, as is said (Deuteronomy 25:3):  "...and your brother will be lashed before your eyes."  As soon as he has been lashed, behold, he is like your brother.  [These are] the words of Rabbi Hanania ben Gamliel.
Rabbi Yochanan said:
The colleagues of Rabbi Hanania ben Gamliel disagreed with him [in this matter].
Rava said:
They said in the school of Rav:
We learned that there is no difference between Yom Kipper and Shabbat except that for this one a premeditated violation [is punished] by human hands and for that one a premeditated violation [is punished] by Karet. 
But if this is so, this one and that one are [both punished] by human hands.
Rav Nahman said:
Whose opinion is this?  It is Rabbi Yitzhak, who said:
Lashes are not a payment for Karet.
As was taught:  Rabbi Yitzhak says:
Those who owe Karet are part of the general principle.  Why is Karet brought out [specially in the case of lying] with his sister?  To judge with Karet and not lashes.
Rav Ashi said:
You can even say that the Rabbis [concur].  For this one, the chief [punishment for] a premeditated violation is in human hands, and for that one, the chief [punishment for] a premeditated violation is with Karet.

Daf 8a

Mishnah.  There is no difference between one who is prohibited by a vow from benefiting from his fellow and one who is prohibited by a vow from [benefiting] from his food, except for setting foot [on his property] and utensils that a person does not use for [preparing] food.
Gemara.  But regarding utensils with which a person prepares food, this one and that one are equal.
'Setting foot': But people are not sensitive [about others setting foot on their property].
Rava said:
Whose opinion is this?  Rabbi Eliezer, who said:
Customary benefits are prohibited to one who is prohibited by a vow from any benefit.
Mishnah.  There is no difference between vow-offerings and generosity-offerings except that vow-offerings obligate one with [providing] surety (for the vowed animal), but generosity-offerings do not obligate one with surety.
Gemara.  But regarding not delaying, this one and that one are equal.
They taught in that case:
What is a vow-offering?  One who says, 'behold, I am raising up a burnt (olah) offering'.
What is a generosity-offering?  One who says, 'behold, this one is a burnt offering'.
And what is [the difference] between vow-offerings and generosity-offerings?
Vow-offerings that die or are stolen or are lost obligate [one to provide] surety (to provide a substitute).  Generosity-offerings that die or are stolen or are lost do not obligate [one to provide] surety.  From where is this thing?
As the Rabbis taught:
(Leviticus 1:4)  "And it will be accepted for him to atone upon him."  Rabbi Shimon says:
That which is 'upon him' obligates him for surety.  That which is not upon him does not obligate him for surety.
What does this imply?
Rabbi Yitzhak bar Avdimi said:
Since he said 'upon me', which is like he was carrying it upon his shoulder.
Mishnah.  There is no difference between a zav who sees two discharges and one who sees three except an offering.  (A zav is a male who experiences a genital discharge of something other than semen.  -- trans.)
Gemara.  But regarding [the defilement of] a couch or a seat and counting seven days, this one and that one are equal.
From where is this thing?
The Rabbis taught:
Rabbi Simai says:
That which is written (Leviticus 15:2) counted two [discharges] and they called [the zav] 'unclean'.  (Leviticus 15:3) Three and they called [the zav] 'unclean'.
In what manner is this?
Two [discharges] to be unclean and three to bring an offering.
Now, say two [discharges] to be unclean and not bring an offering; three to bring an offering but not to be unclean.
Say:
before, he did not see three, he saw [only] two, and say
two to bring an offering and not to be unclean, then three to be unclean.
Do not let this rise up in your mind, for it was taught:
(Leviticus 15:15):  "The priest shall atone for him before Hashem from his discharge."  In some cases, zavs bring an offering and in some cases zavs do not bring an offering.
In what manner is this?
[If] he saw three [discharges] he brings [an offering], [only] two and he does not bring.
'Or he does not', rather,
he saw two [so] he brings [an offering]; he saw three [so] he does not bring.
Say,
before, he did not see three, he saw [only] two.
[The saying of] Rabbi Simai is necessary, and 'from his discharge' is necessary.
For if, from [the saying of] Rabbi Simai I might have stated an objection.  Therefore, we learn from 'from his discharge'.
And if, with 'from his discharge', I would not understand how many sightings [of discharge].  We learn this from Rabbi Simai.
And now that you have said 'from his discharge' is to be expounded, (Leviticus 15:13):  "When the zav has been cleansed from his discharge..."  How do you expound it?
That one is required for that which was taught:
And 'when the zav has been cleansed' for when his discharge has ended.  ['From his discharge'], and not from [both] his discharge and his leprosy (tzaraat).
"From his discharge he shall count" (Leviticus 15:13):  This teaches about the zav who sees two [discharges], so that he requires a count of seven [days].
Can this not be deduced?
If he defiles a couch or a seat, is he not required to count seven [days]?

Daf 8b

[That a woman] observes a day corresponding to a day is evidence that defilement of a couch or seat does not require counting seven [days].
So then you should not be astonished about this, that even though he defiles a couch or a seat he is not required to count seven [days].  The teaching says "from his discharge he shall count".  In some cases, 'from his discharge he shall count' teaches about the zav who sees two [discharges], that he is required to count seven [days].
Rav Pappa said to Abaye:
What changes this 'from his discharge' that it includes 'a zav who sees two [discharges]'?  And what changes this 'from his discharge' that it excludes 'a zav who sees two [discharges]'?
He said to him:
If your mind reasons that this is to exclude that expression, a verse would be silent about it.
And then you will say that this brings in the decision '[a woman who] observes a day corresponding to a day is evidence.
And then you will say:
This one is required for 'from his discharge' and not for leprosy.  If so, let the verse write:  "And when the zav has been cleansed", then remain silent.  Why do I have 'from his discharge'?
It teaches about the zav who sees two [discharges], that he is required to count [seven].
Mishnah.  There is no difference between a potential leper and a confirmed leper except letting one's hair grow and rending a garment.
There is no difference between one cleansed from potential [leprosy] and one cleansed from confirmed [leprosy] except shaving and [offering] birds.
Gemara.  But regarding being sent out [from the camp] [and defilement] this one and that one are equal.
From where is this thing?
As Rav Shmuel bar Yitzhak taught standing near Rav Huna:
(Leviticus 13:6):  "And the priest will pronounce him clean, it is a sore (other than leprosy); and he shall wash his clothes, and he is clean."  He was clean from the start regarding letting hair grow and rending a garment.
Rava said to him:
But according to this, regarding a zav it is written (Leviticus 15:13):  "And he shall wash his clothes and be clean."  In that case, what does 'clean from the start' [mean] here?
Rather,
He is cleansed now from defiling earthenware vessels by shaking them.  Even if he sees another [discharge], he does not defile retroactively.  Here also, [the leper] is cleansed [now from defiling by coming in retroactively].
Rather, Rava said:
From here (Leviticus 13:45):  "And the leper in whom the affliction rests...", [which means] the one whose leprosy is contingent on his body rather than on days.  This excludes one whose leprosy is not contingent on his body, but on days.
Abaye said to him:
But according to this, (Leviticus 13:46):  "All the days that there is an affliction in him he is defiled" [means that] one whose leprosy is contingent on his body is the one who is required to be sent out.  One whose leprosy is not contingent on his body is not required to be sent out.
And thus you may say that here also.  However, it was taught:
There is no difference between a potential leper and a confirmed leper except letting hair grow and rending a garment.  But regarding sending out and defiling by coming in, this one and that one are equal.
He said to him:
'The days' [means] 'all the days'.  [This] includes a potential leper being sent out.
If so, what is the reason for not shaving or [offering] birds?
For it is taught:
There is no difference between being cleansed from potential [leprosy] and being cleansed from confirmed [leprosy] except shaving and [offering] birds.
Abaye said:
A verse (Leviticus 14:3) says:  "The priest will go out to the outside of the camp, ... and behold, the affliction of the leper has been healed."  [This means] one whose leprosy is contingent on healing.  This excludes one whose leprosy is not contingent on healing, but on days.
Mishnah.  There is no difference between scrolls, tefillin, and mezuzahs except that scrolls may be written in any language, while tefillin and mezuzahs may not be written [in anything] but Assyrian script (i.e., Hebrew).  (Assyrian script is the familiar Hebrew square character script.  -- trans.)
Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:
Even with scrolls, they did not permit that they be written [in any foreign language] but Greek.
Gemara.  But [regarding] sewing with sinews and defiling the hands, this one and that one are equal.
'But scrolls may be written in any language', etc.
But this is a contradiction.
Hebrew text that is written in Aramaic, or Aramaic text that is written in Hebrew, or if one wrote in [old] Hebrew [script]:  there is no defilement of the hands until one writes it in Assyrian script upon a scroll with ink.
Rava said:
There is no difficulty.

Daf 9a

Here it is in our characters.  There it is in their characters.
Abaye said to him:
Why did you raise up 'in their characters'?  Why argue about Hebrew that is written in Aramaic or Aramaic that is written in Hebrew?
Even Hebrew that is written in Hebrew and Aramaic that is written in Aramaic also [are not valid].  For it is taught there [that there is no defilement] 'until one writes it in Assyrian script upon a scroll in ink'.
But there is no difficulty.
This [teaching] is by the Rabbis; that [teaching] is by Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.
If this is [the teaching of] Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, there is Greek.
But there is no difficulty.
Here [we are dealing] with scrolls [of Scripture], there [we are dealing] with tefillin and mezuzahs.
What is the reason [for] tefillin and mezuzahs?  Because of that which is written in it (Deuteronomy 6:6):  "...and they shall be...", [which means that] they must be original.  What [cases] are there about Aramaic that has been written in Hebrew?
Certainly, there is [Aramaic in the] Torah (Genesis 31:47):  "Hill of Testimony" (Yegar Sahaduta).
But here [in the case of tefillin and mezuzahs], what Aramaic is there?
But there is no difficulty.
Here [we are dealing] with the Megillah, there [we are dealing] with scrolls [of Scripture].
What is the reason [for] the Megillah?  that which is written in it (Esther 8:9):  "According to their writing and according to their language."  What [cases] of Aramaic that has been written in Hebrew are there?
Rav Pappa said:
(Esther 1:20):  "And the 'decree' of the king shall be heard."  Rav Nachman bar Yitzhak said:
(Esther 1:20):  "And all of the women shall give 'honor' to their husbands."
Rav Ashi said:
This was taught concerning the remaining scrolls [of scripture].  And that is from Rabbi Yehudah.
For it was taught:
Tefillin and mezuzahs may not be written in anything but Assyrian script, but our Rabbis permitted Greek.
But it is written:  "And they shall be".
Rather, say
scrolls may be written in any language, and our Rabbis permitted Greek.
'[Our Rabbis] permitted'.
This implies that the First Kamma prohibited [Greek].
Rather, say
our Rabbis did not permit that they be written in anything but Greek.
And it was taught:  Rabbi Yehudah said:
Even when our Rabbis permitted Greek, they did not permit [it for] anything but a Torah scroll, because of the case of Ptolemy the King.
For it was taught:
[This is] the case of Ptolemy the King, who gathered seventy-two elders and entered them into seventy-two houses, and he did not reveal to them for what he gathered them.
He then met each of them individually and he said to them:
"Write for me the Torah of Moses your teacher [in Greek]."
The Holy One, Blessed Be He put counsel into the heart of each one, and all of them harmonized to one understanding.
