Daf 7b


Raba said, A man is obligated to mellow oneself [get drunk] until he does not know the difference between 'cursed is Haman' and 'Blessed is Mordechai.'
Raba and Rabi Zeira made a Seudat Purim together. They became mellowed and then Raba arose and slaughtered Rabi Zeira. The next day he prayed for [divine] mercy and he returned to life. 
The next year, he [Raba] said to him [Rabi Zeira] "Come and let us make a seudat purim together."  
He [Rabi Zeira] replied, "Not every single time does a miracle occur."
