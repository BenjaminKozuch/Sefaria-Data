Daf 17a

R. Simeon said: They14  remained in the Camp. For when the Holy One, blessed be He, ordered Moses: Gather unto me seventy of the elders of Israel, Eldad and Medad observed, 'We are not worthy of that dignity.' Thereupon the Holy One, blessed be He, said, 'Because you have humbled yourselves, I will add to your greatness yet more greatness.' And how did He add to their dignity? — In that all [the other prophets] prophesied and ceased, but their prophesying did not cease. And what did they prophesy? — They said, 'Moses shall die and Joshua shall bring Israel into the land.'
Abba Hanin said on the authority of R. Eliezer: They prophesied concerning the matter of the quails,15  [saying], 'Arise, quail; arise, quail.'
R. Nahman said: They prophesied concerning Gog and Magog.16  as it is said, Thus saith the Lord God: Art thou he of whom I spoke in old time by My servants the prophets of Israel, that prophesied in those days for many years17  that I would bring thee against them? etc.18  Read not 'shanim' [years] but 'shenayim' [two].19  And which two prophets prophesied the same thing at the same time? — Say, they are Eldad and Medad.
The Master said: 'All the other prophets prophesied and ceased, but they prophesied and did not cease.' Whence do we infer that the others ceased? Shall we say, from the verse, They prophesied 'velo yasafu' [but they did so no more]?20  If so, what of the passage. With a great voice, velo yasaf?21  Does that too mean, it went on no more?22  But that must be interpreted, It did not cease!23  — But here24  it is written, And they prophesied,25  whereas there26  it is stated, [they] were prophesying,27  i.e., they were still continuing to prophesy.
Now, according to the statement [that they prophesied] that Moses would die, [Joshua's request,] My Lord Moses, forbid them, is understandable; but on these two other views,28  why [did he say], My Lord Moses, forbid them29  — Because their behaviour was not seemly, for they were like a disciple who decides questions in the very presence of his teacher. Now, according to these two other opinions [the wish expressed by Moses,] Would that all the Lord's people were prophets29  is reasonable; but on the view [that they prophesied] that Moses would die, was he then pleased therewith? — They did not complete their prophecy in his presence. How was Moses to 'forbid them' [as Joshua requested]? He [Joshua] said to him: Lay upon them public cares, and they will cease [prophesying] of themselves.30
