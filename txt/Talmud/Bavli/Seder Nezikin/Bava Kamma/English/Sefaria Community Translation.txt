MISHNAH: [If] one brings his straw [or thatch] into the public domain for fertilizer and another was damaged by them, he is responsible for the damage. And [furthermore], anyone who first [takes possession] of them is entitled [to the straw]. Rabbi Simeon son of Gamaliel says, anyone who destroys [objects] in the public domain, thereby causing damage is responsible to pay, and anyone who first [takes possession] of them is entitled. [If] one turns over dung in the public domain and another is damaged by it, he is responsible for the damage. 
GEMARA: Can we say that this Mishnah is not like Rabbi Yehudah? That Rabbi Yehudah teaches, "At the time of taking out [foilage to become] fertilizer, people take out their fertilizer to the public domain and heaps it all there for thirty days so that it will be trampled upon by the feet of people and the feet of animals. And it was due to this condition that Joshua caused [Israel] to inherit the land. It's possible to say that even Rabbi Yehudah agrees that if damage was caused [the owner of the fertilizer] should compensate for the damage. But there is a teaching that Rabbi Yehudah said:"In regards to a Chanukkah candle, he is exempt because he had permission [to place it in the public domain]." Is it not the case that this permission comes from the courthouse? No, but the permission comes from the mitzvah, that it's taught "Rabbi Yehudah said: 'in regards to a Chanukkah candle, he is exempt because he had permission [to place it in the public domain] of a mitzvah. Come and hear: In all the cases where they said that it is permissible to [place] nuisances in the public domain, if they caused damages they [the one who placed the nuisances] are obligated to compensate, and Rabbi Yehudah exempts them. Rav Nachman said: "Our Mishnah is not during the time of taking out [foilage to become] fertilizer, and it is Rabbi Yehudah [who wrote it]. Rav Ashi said:

"His straw and his thatch" [The mishnah] teaches because they are slippery.

The rabbis taught: A person may not take stones from his domain into the public domain. A story is told of a person who was clearing stones from his domain into the public domain, and a certain pious person found him. He said to him, "Why are you clearing out a domain that does not belong to you into a domain that belongs to you?" He scoffed at him. After a time that person had to sell his field, and he was walking in that public area, and he stumbled on one of the stones. He said, "That pious person spoke well when he said to me , why are you clearing stones from a domain that is not yours to a domain that is yours."

MISHNAH: A spark that escapes from under a hammer and causes damage, [the one who caused the spark] is liable. A camel that was loaded with flax and was passing through the public domain and the flax entered into a store and was lit by a candle of the store owner and lit the building on fire, the owner of the camel is liable. The store owner who places his candle outside of his shop is liable. Rabbi Yehudah said:"In regards to a chanukkah candle he is exempt."
GEMARA: Ravina said in the name of Rava: "Learn from the words of Rabbi Yehudah that the mitzvah to place [Chanukkah candles] is within ten [tefachim, hand-breadths]. That if you would have thought that [the mitzvah] was for above ten [hand-breadths] why would Rabbi Yehudah [maintain that the one who places a] Chanukkah candle [that does damage] is exempt? Why should [the plaintiff] not say [against] him "You should place it above the camel and it's rider!" Rather, no. Learn from this that the mitzvah is to place it within ten. But this is not always so. You could say that even above ten! And what about your argument that "You should have placed it above the camel and it's rider?" That since it's in regards to being busy with a mitzvah, to that extent the rabbis could not make it troublesome. Rav Kahana said that Rav Natan the son of Meneyomi raised an opinion in the name of Rabbi Tanchum "A chanukkah candle that is placed above twenty cubits is invalid, like a sukkah and an alleyway."
