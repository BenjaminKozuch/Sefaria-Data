Daf 19a

Raba said: One should always study that part of the Torah which is his heart desires, as it is said: But his desire is in the Torah of Hashem. Raba also said: At the outset, the Torah is ascribed to the Holy One, blessed be He, but at the end, the Torah is ascrobed to him [who studies it], for it is said: But his desire is in the Torah of Hashem, and in his [own] Torah does he meditate day and night.
