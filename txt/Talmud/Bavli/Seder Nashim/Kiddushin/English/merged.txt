￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Rabban Johanan b. Zakkai used to expound this verse as precious stone. Why was the ear singled out from all the other limbs of the body? The Holy One, blessed be He, said: This ear, which heard my Voice on Mount Sinai when I proclaimed, For unto me the children of Israel are servants, they are my servants, and not servants of servants, and yet this [man] went and acquired a master for himself — let it be bored! R. Simeon b. Rabbi too expounded this verse as a precious stone. Why were the door and doorpost singled out from all other parts10 of the house? The Holy One, blessed be He, said: The door and the doorpost, which were witnesses in Egypt when I passed over the lintel and the doorposts and proclaimed, For unto me the children of Israel are servants, they are my servants,11 and not servants of servants, and so I brought them forth from bondage to freedom, yet this [man] went and acquired a master for himself — let him be bored in their presence!

Rav Safra said in the name of R Yehoshua ben Chananya: "What is implied by that which is written: and you shall teach them thoroughly to your children?
Do not read v'shinantam, rather v'shilashtam. A man should always divide the years of his life into thirds, spending a third of them studying Scripture, a third studying Mishnah and a third studying Talmud.
But, who knows the length of one's life?
Rav Safra's teaching is indicating the division of days.

"It is not fitting for artisans to stand for Torah scholars while they are doing their work".
Is it really not?
But we are taught:
"All the artisans of Jerusalem would stand before them and greet them,
'Our brothers from so-and-so, come in peace!'"
Rabi Yochanan said,
"Before them [the artisans] stand, but not before Torah scholars."
Rabi Yosi bar Avin said,
"Come and see how precious a mitzvah is at its proper time, because [the artisans] stand before them, but not before Torah scholars."
Perhaps there is different because if so [if you would not greet them], you would cause them to stumble [sin] in the future [because they will be discouraged from coming]!

Rav Yehudah said in the name of Shmuel: The verse (Numbers 25, 12) says, “And therefore say, behold I give to him my covenant of peace—shalom.” When he is shalem (whole/complete) and not when he is chaser (missing something/diminished). But hey, the Torah  wrote “shalom”! Said Rav Nachman: The “vav” of shalom is (written) broken.

...how do we know that the issue [of a Gentile woman] takes her status?...because Scripture says, "neither shalt thou make marriages with them" (Deuteronomy 7:3) How do we know that her issue bears her status? — R. Johanan said on the authority of R. Simeon b. Yohai, Because Scripture says, "For he will turn away thy son from following me" (ibid): thy son by an Israelite woman is called thy son, but thy son by a heathen is not called thy son. Rabina said: This proves that thy daughter's son by a heathen is called thy son. Shall we say that Rabina holds that if a heathen or a [non-Jewish] slave cohabits with a Jewess the issue is mamzer? — [No.] Granted that he is not [regarded as] fit, he is not mamzer either, but merely stigmatized as unfit. Now, that [verse] refers to the seven nations! whence do we know it of other nations? — Scripture saith, ‘For he will turn away [thy son],’ which includes all who may turn [him] away. That is well according to R. Simeon, who interprets the reason of Scripture.11 But on the view of the Rabbis,12 what is the reason?13 — Scripture saith, and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, [etc.],14 whence it follows that before that kiddushin with her is invalid. We have thus found that kiddushin with her is not recognised. How do we know that her child is as herself? — Scripture saith, If there be to a man [two wives] . . . and they bare to him [children]:15 where we read ‘if there be’,16 we also read: ‘and they bare to him’;17 but where we do not read: ‘If there be’, we do not read: ‘and they bare to him’. If so, is not a [heathen] bondmaid likewise? — Yes, it is even thus. Then what is the purpose of ‘the wife and her children shall be her master's’? —

Pelimo used to say every day, ‘An arrow in Satan's eyes!’35 One day — it was the eve of the Day
of Atonement — he disguised himself as a poor man and went and called out at his door; so bread
was taken out to him. ‘On such a day,’ he pleaded, ‘when everyone is within, shall I be without?’
Thereupon he was taken in and bread was offered him. ‘On a day like this,’ he urged, ‘when
everyone sits at table,36 shall I sit alone!’ He was led and sat down at the table. As he sat, his body
was covered with suppurating sores, and he was behaving repulsively.37 ‘Sit properly,’ he rebuked
him....

(35) Cf. supra 30a top. [= I defy you! being absolutely free from impure thoughts. In the Bible, Satan has the general connotation of adversary (v. I Kings V, 18; I Sam. XXIX, 4; Ps. CIX, 4), and at first he is not regarded as a distinct being. In Job, however, he does appear so, viz., as the celestial prosecutor; but even then, he cannot act independently, but requires God's permission. It is only later that he appears as an independent agent (I Chron. XXI, 2). The early portions of the Talmud mention him very rarely. but gradually belief in him spread. the popular concepts possibly forcing their way upwards from the lower classes. V. J.E. art. Satan.]
(36) Lit., ‘at the tray’.
(37) Wriggling, or perhaps scratching himself.




























 Rav Kahana said:
"Men on the outside and women on the inside we are not concerned about yichud; men on the inside and women on the outside -we are concerned about yichud."
In a beraita it was taught the opposite.
Abayei said:
"Now that Rav Kahana said this, and the beraita teaches the opposite, I will act stringently."
Abayei would arrange pottery. Rava would arrange reeds.
Avin said:
"The weakest part of the year [is the] festival."
Those captive women who arrived at Naharda', they brought them up to the [attic of] the house of Rav Amram the Pious, and removed the ladder from before them.
As one of them was passing [before the opening], a light fell upon the opening [because of her great beauty]. Rav Amram took the ladder that ten were not able to move, and moved it by himself. He went and ascended;
when he got halfway up the ladder he spread [his feet to steady himself], and raised his voice:
 "Fire in the house of Amram!"
The rabbis came. 
They said to him:
"You have embarrassed us!"
He said to them: 
"It is better you should be embarrassed in the house of Amram in this world and you will not be embarrassed because of him in the World to Come."
He made (the evil inclination) swear to leave him, he left him as a pillar of fire;
he said to him:
 "Look, you are fire and I am flesh, and I am better than you."




















Daf 81b


Every time Rabbi Chiya bar Abba fell upon his face (in the Tachanun prayer) he used to say, ‘The Merciful save me from the Yetzer Ha'Rah. One day his wife overheard him. ‘Let me see,’ she reflected, ‘it is so many years that he has separated from me: why then should he say that?’ One day, while he was studying in his garden, she adorned herself with a scarf and strolled in front of him.  ‘Who are you?’ he asked. ‘I am Cheruta, and have returned today,’ she replied. He desired her. Said she to him, ‘Bring me that pomegranate from the uppermost branch.’ He jumped up, went, and brought it to her. When he re-entered his house, his wife was firing the oven,whereupon he went and sat in it. ‘What is this?’ she asked. He told her what had happened.‘It was I,’ she told him; but he paid no heed to her until she gave him proof. ‘Nevertheless,’ said he, ‘my intention was evil.’ That righteous man fasted all his life, until he died from that very death.
