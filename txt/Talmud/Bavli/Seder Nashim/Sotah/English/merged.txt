Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a

A man who warns his wife - R' Eliezer says, he must warn her before two witnesses, but he can make her drink the bitter water of the Sotah ceremony on the evidence of one witness or his own testimony. R' Joshua says, he must warn her before two witnesses and can make her drink only on the testimony of two witnesses. How does he warn her? He says to her before two witnesses, "Do not speak with a certain man." And if she speaks with him, she is still permitted in her house (to have sexual relations with her husband) and permitted to eat the Terumah. If she meets with him secretly in a house and stays with him long enough to become impure, she is forbidden to her husband and forbidden to eat the Terumah. And if her husband dies, she performs the Chalitza ceremony and does not contract a Levirate Marriage to one of his male relatives.
Gemara: let's examine this: the Tanna just finished teaching Nazir; why is the Tanna now teaching Sotah? In accordance with Rebbi, as it is taught in a baraisa, "Rebbi says, why is Parshas Nazir juxtaposed with Parshas Sotah? To tell you that anyone who sees a Sotah in her destruction should abstain himself from wine." The Tanna, then, should teach Sotah and then teach Nazir! Since the Tanna taught Kesubos and taught [in it Perek] HaMdir, he taught Nedarim; and since he taught Nedarim, he taught Nazir, which is similar to Nedarim; and then he taught Sotah in accordance with Rebbi.

Daf 6a






















...These [women] are prohibited from eating terumah:
...A [woman] who says [to her husband] I have been unclean to you and one with whom a witness comes and says that she is unclean, and one that says that they will not drink [the 'cleansing water'], and one whose husband does not wish to give her to drink and one who slept with her husband on the road. 

Daf 6b



Daf 7a




...What should he [the husband] do with her?
...He takes her to the local court where two Torah students would be given [for the journey] lest they sleep together on the road.
...Rabbi Yehuda says:
Her husband can be trusted to be around her. 



































...They bring the woman up to the Highest Court [beis din] in Jerusalem and the Court tries to worry her [into admitting guilt]. The same way that they worry witnesses in other capital court cases. 
...They say to her
...Daughter
...Wine is the cause of deeds, being light causes deeds, immaturity causes deeds, [and] bad neighbors cause deeds.
...Do it for The Great Name written in holiness [and admit to the crime] so that [the name] not be erased in the water. 
...They tell her of things she does not deserve to hear about, [not] her nor her fathers family. 
...If [she] said "I am unclean" she writes a document of [כתובה] and leaves. 
...And if she says "I am clean" they take her to the East gate, which was the other direction of the [נקנור] gate, this is where they give adulteresses [the waters] to drink, and make clean women who gave birth, and make clean [somebody who has leprosy].   
...A Kohen takes her clothes, if they are ripped they are ripped and if they are shredded they are shredded until he makes her heart bare and then he undoes her hair. 
...Rabbi Yehudah Says
...If her heart was beautiful he would not make it bare and her hair was beautiful he would  not undo it. 
...If she had white clothes [she is] dressed in black if she was wearing gold...

Daf 7b

...bibs, nose rings or finger rings they remove them to make her ugly
After a rope is brought made of palm and it is tied to her heart, whomever wants to watch can watch, except for her slaves and servants because their presence would make brave her heart.
And all women are allowed to watch; as it says: and all women shall see it and will not imitate your crime. 

Daf 8a



Daf 8b

...The two statements by the rabbinate don't contradict.  
...here, what is the reason? Because it says: And all the women will be rebuked. There is no greater rebuke than this.
...And if you say, "let us do both" [it will be even better as a form of rebuke]. R' Nachman says in the name of Rava bar Avuha: 
...Scripture says; and love your friend like yourself [and we can learn from this] you should choose for him the most favorable type of death. 
...Let us say this [above] is of R'Nachman; a dispute among the tannaim
...No, we can say that they accept R'Nachman
...And they dispute the following: ...
...[this] master holds that
...one's shaming is more significant than the injuring of his body and [the other] master 
...holds that injuring of ones body is more significant to him than his shaming.
...[mishnah] If she was dressed in white...
...it was taught
...if black suited her, they would dress her in unbecoming clothing.
...[mishnah] if she was wearing gold adornments [jewelry]...
...it is plain
...If they [go as far as they do to] make her ugly 
...Is it necessary [to include this]?
...You could have said; "with these she is even more shamed" like people say:
..."He is lacking clothing, and [still] wearing shoes" informs [the mishnah].
...[mishnah] After a rope of palm is brought...
...R'abba asked of Rav Huna
...The palm rope; what is it; essential or not for Sotah?
...[is it] so that her clothes will not slip off her? And [if so] wouldn't a small belt be enough? Or maybe it is brought because of what was said by this master:


















...The same way he measures out his measures so to it is measured for him [by Hashem] 
She decorated herself for the sin and Hashem disgraced her.  She revealed herself [to do the] in sin and Hashem revealed her. As she first sinned with her thigh and after with her belly, so the thigh is punished first and the belly [after], and the rest of [her] body is not free. 

...Rav Yosef says:
...Even though the way [of punishment] has become nullified the  [rule of] measure [for measure punishment] has not become nullified.
...As R'Yosef says: the same was taught by R'Chiyah in a baraisa:
...From the day of the destruction of the beis hamikdash, even though the sanhedrin stopped, the four types of capital punishments have not become nullified. 
Surely they have become nullified
But 
...instead the four types of capital punishment have not become nullified
...one who deserves [to be] stoned; either falls from a roof or is crushed by wild animals. 
...one who deserves [to be] burnt; either falls into a fire or is bit by a [venomous] snake. 
...One who deserves [to be] beheaded; either is give to somebody in authority or bandits happen upon them.
...One who deserves [to be] asphyxiated; either is drowned in a river or dies of [a disease that constricts the throat] 
...It was taught; Rebbe used to say:

Rabbi Yitzhak said:
One should always stand in awe of the community.  Indeed, the Kohanim (Priests) stood with their faces toward the people and their backs to the Shechinah (Divine Presence).
