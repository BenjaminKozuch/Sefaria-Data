Chapter 1

The principle impurities: the <em>sheretz</em> [one of eight creeping creatures, whose identities are debated, and whose carcasses transmit ritual impurity upon contact], semen, that which is rendered impure by a dead body, the <em>metzora</em> [victim of a Divinely inflicted skin disease] while he is in his days of counting, a small amount of purifying water that is not enough to perform the sprinkling ceremony -  can render persons and vessels impure through touch, and pottery vessels through the air, but they do not render impure when they are carried.
Higher than these: the <em>nevelah</em> [an animal which died without proper slaughter] and purifying water of which there is enough to perform the sprinkling ceremony, as they render impure a person through carrying and clothing through touch, and without clothes [on an unclothed area of a person], by touch.
Higher than these: one who has intercourse with a <em>niddah</em> [a woman who is menstruating or has menstruated, but has not yet immersed], for he renders impure the bottom [layer] of what lies beneath him in like degree to the top. Higher than this: the abnormal genital discharge of a <em>zav</em> [man with an abnormal genital discharge], his spittle, his semen, and his urine, and the blood of the menstruant, for they convey impurity both by contact and by carrying. Higher than these: the impurity of a saddle, for it conveys impurity even to what lies beneath a heavy stone. Higher than a saddle: what one lies upon, since contact with it is equal to carrying it. Higher than what one lies upon: a <em>zav</em>; for a <em>zav</em> conveys impurity to what he lies upon, while what he lies upon does not convey the same level of impurity to that upon which it lies.
Higher than the <em>zav</em> is the <em>zavah</em> [a woman with an abnormal genital discharge], for she conveys impurity to one who has intercourse with her. Higher than the <em>zavah</em>: the <em>metzora</em>, for he renders impure by entering. Higher than the <em>metzora</em>: bone the size of a barley grain, for it coneys seven-day impurity. More severe than all of these: a corpse, for it conveys <em>ohel</em> impurity ["tent" impurity; i.e., it renders objects and persons within the same overshadowed area impure], which nothing else can do. 
Ten degrees of impurity are derived from a person: the one whose atonement is incomplete [who has not brought a required sacrifice] is prohibited to eat <em>kodesh</em> [portions of offerings assigned to the priests], but permitted to eat <em>terumah</em> [portion of crops, wine, etc. required to be given to a priest] and <em>ma'aser</em> [tithes]. Should he become a <em>tevul yom</em> [immerses in the day and becomes pure upon nightfall], he is forbidden to eat <em>kodesh</em> and <em>terumah</em>,  but permitted to eat <em>ma'aser</em>. Should he have a nocturnal emission, he is prohibited in all three. Should he have intercourse with a <em>niddah</em>, he transmits impurity to the bottom layer lying beneath him as he does to the top. Should he become a <em>zav</em> and has see two appearances [of discharge], he transmits impurity to the bed and the chair and needs to immerse in running water, but he is exempt from [bringing] an offering. If he sees a third [appearance], he is bound [to bring] an offering. Should he become a quarantined [suspected] <em>metzora</em>, he transmits impurity by entering [a house], but is exempt from loosening [hair], from tearing [of clothing], from shaving, and from the [offering of the] birds. But if he is declared a <em>metzora</em>, he is obligated in all of them. If a limb without enough flesh on it is separated from him, it transmits impurity through contact and through carrying, but it does not transmit impurity in a tent. And if there is enough flesh on it, then it transmits impurity through contact, and through carrying and in the tent. The measure of flesh that is sufficient is enough to bring up a scab. R. Yehuda says, If there is enough [flesh] in one place to surround it with the thread of the woof, it is able to bring up a scab. 
There are ten degrees of holiness. The land of Israel is holier than any other land. Wherein lies its holiness? In that from it are brought the <em>omer</em> [barley offering brought on the second day of Passover], the first fruits, and the two loaves [offered on Shavuot], which may not be brought from any other land.
The walled cities are still more holy, in that they must send forth the <em>metzoraim</em> from their midst, and they may carry around a corpse therein as far as necessary, but once it is taken out, they may not bring it back.
Inside the wall [of Jerusalem] is more holy than these, because there the less holy [offerings] and the second tithe are eaten. The Temple Mount has greater sanctity, because men and women with discharges, menstruating women, and women who have given birth may not enter there. The outer wall of the Temple courtyard has higher sanctity, because gentiles and people contaminated with corpse impurity may not enter there. The women's courtyard has higher sanctity, because a <em>tevul yom</em> may not enter there, but they are not liable for a sin offering for doing so. The Israelites' courtyard has higher sanctity, because one who lacks atonement may not enter there, and is liable for a sin offering for doing so. The priests' courtyard has higher sanctity, because the Israelites may not enter there except at the time of their [ritual] requirements: the laying on of hands, the slaughter, and the wave-offering. 
Between the porch and the altar has still higher sanctity, because [priests] with blemishes and loosened hair may not enter there. The sanctuary has higher sanctity, because no one may enter there who has not washed their hands and feet. The holy of holies has greater sanctity than these, because no one may enter there except the High Priest on the Day of Atonement at the time of the service. Rabbi Yose said: In five ways [the area] between the porch and the altar is equal to the sanctuary because [priests] with blemishes, loosened hair, who have consumed wine, and who have not washed their hands and feet may not enter there, and they separate themselves from between the porch and the altar at the time of [the offering of the] incense. 

Chapter 2



Chapter 3

The measure of [a hole in] a clay vessel to make it pure, if it is used for foods, its measure is with olives. If it is used for liquids, its measure is with liquids. If it is used for this [foods] and for that [liquids], they impose the stringent ruling on it, with olives. 
Concerning a jug, its measure [of a hole large enough to render it ritually pure] is with dried figs, [these are] the words of Rabbi Shimon. Rabbi Yehudah says, with nuts. Rabbi Meir says, with olives. Concerning a stew pot and a cooking pot, their measure is with olives. Concerning an [oil] cruse and a pitcher, their measure is with oil. Concerning a jug [for oil or wine], its measure is with water. Rabbi Shimon says, concerning these three, [their measure] is with seeds. Concerning a lamp, its measure is with oil. R. Eliezer says "with a small peturah."  Concerning a lamp whose spout has been taken, it is clean. And one [made] of clay whose spout is burned by the wick, it is clean.   
A jug which had a hole which was repaired with pitch, and it was then broken: if there is in the place of the pitch [an area large] enough to hold a <em>revi'it</em>, it is still impure because it did not lose the status of a vessel.  If it was made of earthenware and it was pierced and repaired with pitch, even if it holds a <em>revi'it</em> it is pure because it lost the status of a vessel. 
A jar that is broken, and it is plastered with dung, even if when the dung is removed the shards will fall apart, [can become] impure because it retains the status of a vessel. If it was broken and shards from it are stuck together, or shards are brought from another place and plastered with dung, even if when the dung is removed the shards remain together, it is pure, because it has lost the status of a vessel. If there is a shard that can hold a <em>revi'it</em>, the whole [vessel] is susceptible to impurity by contact, and [what is] opposite from it is made impure through the air. 
If an intact clay vessel is plastered, Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Shimon [declare] it susceptible to impurity. The Sages say, if an intact clay vessel is plastered, it is not subject to impurity. And an unsound vessel  may become impure [if plastered].  And so also for the [clay] lining of a gourd. 
The pulp used to line large jars is subject to ritual impurity through touch.  The stopper of a jar is not [considered] connected [to the jar].  Whatever touches the plaster of the oven [may become] impure. 
If a vessel for heating water is plastered with potter's clay or kaolin, whatever touches the clay is subject to impurity, but whatever touches the kaolin is not subject to impurity. A kettle that was perforated and repaired with pitch, Rabbi Yose [declares it] pure because it is not able to hold hot water as [it can hold] cold [water]. And so he says with regard to vessels of pitch. Vessels of copper plastered with pitch, they are pure. But if [they are] for wine, they are subject to impurity. 
A jar which was perforated and repaired with more pitch than needed, whatever touches the [pitch that is] necessary may become impure.  [Whatever touches] the extra pitch remains pure. Pitch that drops on a jar, whatever touches it is pure. A funnel [made of] wood or of clay which is plugged with pitch, Rabbi Eliezer ben Azariah declares it subject to become impure. Rabbi Akiva declares it subject to become impure if it is of wood, but not if it is of clay. Rabbi Yose declares both of them pure. 

Chapter 4

A piece of pottery, which cannot stand because of its handle or because it has a pointed bottom, is pure [i.e., not susceptible to ritual impurity]. If the handle broke off or the point was broken off, it is pure. Rabbi Yehudah says it is impure [i.e., capable of contracting ritual impurity]. A jug which lost a piece but can still contain with its sides, or became divided like two troughs - Rabbi Yehudah says it is pure, but the Sages say it is impure.  
A jug which broke and cannot be carried while holding half a <em>kav</em> of dried figs is pure. A defective vessel which cracked and can no longer hold liquids, even though it can still hold food, is pure, because a broken utensil cannot be considered to become further broken. 
What is considered a defective vessel?  Any whose handles were broken off. If it had hollow knobs, if it can hold olives it can become impure by touching and can make things opposite it impure through the air. If it cannot hold olives it can become impure by touching but does not make things opposite it impure.  If it was laying on its side like a <em>katedra</em> chair - if it can hold olives, it can become impure by touching and can make things opposite it impure through the air; if it cannot hold olives, it can become impure by touching but does not make things opposite it impure through the air. The bottom of a pointed vessel and the bottom of Sidonian cups, even though they cannot rest without support, they are impure because they were made this way. 
An earthenware vessel that has three lips, if the inner one extends, everything is pure; if the outer one extends, everything is impure.  If the middle one extends, from it to the inside is impure, and from it to the outside is pure.  If they were all even, Rabbi Yehudah says the middle one is divided, but the Sages say the entire vessel is pure. When does an earthenware vessel become susceptible to impurity? When it is fired in the kiln, and this completes its work. 

Chapter 5

An oven's minimum size [to be able to become ritually impure] is four  <em>tefachim</em> [in height] and its remainder [that remains impure when it is broken] is four <em>tefachim</em>; the words of Rabbi Meir. The Sages say, this is only true regarding a large oven; regarding a small oven, however, it beginning [point] is any [size] and its remainder is a majority [of its size] once its manufacture has been completed. What is the completion of its manufacture? Once it is kindled enough to bake a sponge cake in it. Rabbi Yehudah says, once it is kindled enough to bake a sponge cake [as] in an old oven.
A stove's minimum size [to become ritually impure] is three [<em>tefachim</em> in height] and its remainder [that remains impure when it is broken] is three [<em>tefachim</em>, once its manufacture is complete. What is the completion of its manufacture? When it is kindled enough to cook the easiest-cooking of eggs on it, scrambled and placed in a pot. A <em>kupach</em> [small stove or brazier] that is made to bake has the same measurement requirements as an oven. If it was made to cook, its measurement requirements are that of a stove. A stone that protrudes a <em>tefach</em> from the oven or a distance of three fingers from a stove is connected. If it protrudes from a <em>kupach</em> made for baking, the measurement is that of the oven. If from a <em>kupach</em> made to cook, its measurement is that of a stove. Rabbi Yehudah says, they did not say tefach except [when the protrusion is] between the oven and the wall. If there were two ovens next to each other, give each one a <em>tefach</em> and the rest is pure.
The rim of a stove is pure. The surrounding brickwork of an oven, when it is [at least] four Tefachim (Mishnaic length) tall, becomes impure through [an impure object's] touch or through [the object] in its air[space]. Less than this, it is pure. If it is attached [to the oven], even if on three stones, it is impure. The holder for an oil jug, the holder for a spicebox or the holder of a light on a stove, become impure through [an impure object's] contact [with the stove] but are not impure through its air[space]. These are the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yishmael says they are pure.
An oven that was heated from its outside, or that was that was heated without intent to complete it, or that was heated [while still] in the craftsman's house, is susceptible to impurity. There was a story that a fire fell on the ovens of Kfar Signa, and the story came to Yavneh, and Raban Gamliel ruled them susceptible to impurity.
The extension on a householder's oven [a thick rim on top] is pure. But that of a baker's oven is impure because he rests a spit on it. Rabbi Yochanan Hasandlar says: [It is impure] because he bakes with it [by placing dough on the inside of the rim] when he is pressured. Similarly, the extension of an olive cooker's cauldron is impure. But that of a dyer's cauldron is pure.
An oven half filled with earth - the part from the earth downwards contracts impurity by contact; the part from the earth upwards contracts impurity [also] from its air-space. If the oven is placed over the mouth of a cistern or over that of a cellar and a stone is placed at its side:  Rabbi Yehudah says: if when heated from below it becomes also heated above it is susceptible to impurity. But the Sages say: since it was heated in any case it is susceptible to impurity.   
An oven which contracted impurity - how is it purified?  It is divided into three parts and the plastering is scraped off so that [the oven] touches the ground. Rabbi Meir says: it is not necessary to scrape off the plastering nor is it necessary for [the oven] to touch the ground. Rather he reduces it within to a height of less than four <em>tefachim</em>.  Rabbi Shimon says: it must be moved [from its position]. If it is divided into two parts, one large and the other small, the larger remains impure and the smaller becomes pure. If it is divided into three parts one of which was as big as the other two together, the big one remains impure and the two small ones become pure. 
If [the oven] is cut up by its width into rings that are each less than four <em>tefachim</em> in height, it is pure.  If it is subsequently plastered over with clay, it becomes susceptible to impurity when it is heated to a degree that is enough for baking sponge cakes.  If he distanced the plastering, and he put sand or gravel between it and the oven sides — of such an oven they said, "A menstruant as well as a ritually pure woman may bake in it and it remains ritually pure."  
An oven which came cut up in sections from the craftsman's house and hoops are made for it and put on it, is pure. If it contracts impurity, and then the hoops are removed, it is pure. If he put them back on, it remains pure. If it is plastered with clay, it becomes susceptible to impurity, and there is no need to heat it since it was once heated. 
If an oven is cut into rings, and sand is placed between the rings,   Rabbi Eliezer says it is pure. But the sages say it is susceptible to impurity. This is the oven of Akhnai. Arabian vats, which are holes dug in the ground and plastered with clay - if the plastering can stand by itself it is susceptible to impurity; otherwise, it is not susceptible.  This is the oven of Ben Dinai. 
An oven of stone or of metal is pure [according to the rules applied to ovens], but [the metal one] is subject to impurity as a metal vessel. If a hole was made in it, or if it was damaged or cracked, and lined with plaster or with a rim of clay, it is subject to impurity. What must be the size of the hole [for it to be pure]? It must be big enough for the flame to come through.  The same applies also to a stove: a stove of stone or of metal is not subject to impurity [according to the laws for a stove]. But [the metal one] is subject to impurity as a metal vessel. If a hole was made in it or if it was damaged or cracked but he made props for it, it is impure. If he lined it with clay, whether inside or outside, it remains pure.  Rabbi Yehudah says: if [the lining was] inside, it is subject to impurity; but if outside, it remains pure. 

Chapter 6

One who puts three props into the ground and joins them [to the ground] with clay so that he can set a pot on them, [the structure] is susceptible to impurity. If he set three nails in the ground so that he could set a pot on them, even though he made a place on the top for the pot to rest, [the structure] is not susceptible to impurity. One who makes a stove of two stones, and joins them [to the ground] with clay, it is susceptible to impurity. Rabbi Yehudah says it is not susceptible to impurity unless he makes a third stone or he places it against a wall.   If one stone [was joined] with clay and the other was not joined with clay, it is not susceptible to impurity.  
A stone on which he placed [a pot] on it and on an oven, or on it and on a double stove, or on it and on a stove, is susceptible to impurity. [If he set the pot] on it and on another stone, on it and on a rock, or on it and on a wall, it is not susceptible to impurity. And such was the stove of the Nazirites in Jerusalem which was set up against a rock. The stove of the butchers: when the stones are placed side by side, if one of the stoves contracted impurity, the others do not become impure.   
Three stones on which two ovens are made: if one of the outer ones became impure, the half of the middle one that serves the impure one is impure, but the [half of it] that serves the pure one remains pure.  If he removed the pure one, the middle one is completely transferred to the impure one. If he removed the impure one, the middle one is completely transferred to the pure one. If the two outer ones become impure, if the middle stone was large, one outer stone is assigned a part of it that suffices for the support of a pot and the other outer stone a part of it that suffices for the support of a pot, and the remainder is pure. But if it was small, all of it is impure. If he removes the middle stone, if he can set a big pot on it [the stove], they [the outer stones] are impure. If he put it back, they all are pure. If he plastered it [the middle stone] with clay, it becomes susceptible to impurity when it is heated to a degree that suffices for the cooking of an egg.  
Two stones upon which a stove is made that become impure: if he put a stone near the outer side of the one and another stone near the outer side of the other, [the inner half] of each [of the inner stones] remains impure while [the outer] half of each [of these stones] is pure. If he removed the pure stones, the others return to their impurity. 

Chapter 7

The fire-basket of a householder which was decreased in size to less than three <em>tefachim</em> is susceptible to impurity, because when it is heated from below a pot above would still boil. If [it was decreased in size] further, it is not susceptible to impurity. If [subsequently] a stone or gravel was put into it, it is still not susceptible to impurity. If it was plastered over with clay, it may contract impurity from that point onward. This was Rabbi Yehudah's reply regarding the oven that was placed over the mouth of a cistern or over that of a cellar.   
A hob that has a receptacle for pots is not subject to impurity under the laws of a stove, but subject to impurity as a receptacle. Whatever touches its sides does not become impure under the laws of a stove.  Its wide side: Rabbi Meir holds it to be pure, but Rabbi Yehudah holds it to be impure. The same law applies also when one turns over  a basket and makes a stove upon it. 
A double stove which was split into two parts along its length is not subject to impurity.  [If it is split along] its breadth, it is subject to impurity. A one-pot stove which was split into two parts, by its length or by its width, is not susceptible to impurity. The extension around a stove, whenever it is three finger-breadths high, contracts impurity by contact and also through its air-space, but if it is less than this it contracts impurity through contact and not through its air-space. How do they determine the air-space ? Rabbi Yishmael says: He puts a spit from above to below and through that distance it contracts impurity through the air-space. Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya'acov says: If the stove contracted impurity, the extension is also impure, but if the extension becomes impure, the stove does not become impure. 
If it [the extension] was detached from the stove, if it is three finger-breadths high it contracts impurity by contact and through its air-space; if it was lower or if it was smooth, it is not subject to impurity. If the clay tripod of a stove is three finger-breadths high, it contracts impurity by contact and through its air-space. If it is lower, all the more so does it contract impurity, even if [its props] were four in number.    
If he removed one of them [i.e. the props of the tripod], the remaining ones contract impurity by contact but not through air-space; the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Shimon says that they are not subject to impurity.  If he made two props, one opposite the other, they contract impurity by contact and through air-space; the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Shimon says that they are pure. If they were more than three finger-breadths high, the parts that are three finger-breadths high and below contract impurity by contact and through air-space, but the parts that are more than three finger-breadths high contract impurity by contact and not through air-space; the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Shimon says that they are pure. If they extend beyond the rim [of the stove], the parts which are within three finger-breadths [of the rim] contract impurity by contact and through air-space, and those parts that extend out more than three finger-breadths contract impurity by contact but not through air-space; the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Shimon says that they are pure.  
How do they measure them [the three finger-breadths at issue]? Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: he puts the measuring-rod between them, from the measuring-rod and outwards is pure; from the measuring-rod and inwards, including the place of the measuring-rod itself, is impure. 

Chapter 8

An oven which they partitioned with boards or hangings, and in it was found a <em>sheretz</em> [one of a number of species of reptiles and rodents] in one compartment, the entire oven is impure. If a hive is broken and its gap stopped up with straw, and it was suspended within the air-space of an oven while a <em>sheretz</em> was within it [the hive], the oven becomes impure. If a <em>sheretz</em> was within the oven, any food within the hive becomes impure. But Rabbi Eliezer says that it is pure. Rabbi Eliezer said: If it affords protection in the case of a corpse, which is more consequential, should it not afford protection in the case of an earthenware vessel, which is less consequential? They said to him: If it affords protection in the case of a corpse, it is because tents may be divided; should it also afford protection in the case of an earthenware vessel, which may not be divided? 
If the hive was complete, and so too in the case of a basket or a skin-bottle, and a <em>sheretz</em> was within it, the oven remains pure.    If the <em>sheretz</em> was in the oven, any food in the hive remains pure. If a hole was made in it: A vessel that is used for food must have a hole large enough for olives to fall through. If it is used for liquids the hole must be large enough for liquids to pass through it. And if it is used for either, they place upon it the greater restriction: the hole need only be large enough for liquids to pass through it.   
Netting placed over the mouth of an oven and slightly sinking into it, and having no frame: If a <em>sheretz</em> was in it, the oven becomes impure; if the <em>sheretz</em> was in the oven, the food in the netting becomes impure, since only vessels afford protection against an impurity in an earthen vessel. If a barrel full of pure liquids is placed beneath the bottom of an oven, and a <em>sheretz</em> is in the oven – the barrel and the liquids remain pure. If it was inverted, with its mouth over the air-space of the oven, and a <em>sheretz</em> was in the oven, the liquid that clings to the sides of the barrel remains pure.  
A pot which was placed in an oven—if a <em>sheretz</em> was in the oven, the pot remains pure, since an earthenware vessel does not impart impurity to vessels. If it contained dripping liquid, it [the liquid] contracts impurity and the pot also becomes impure. It is as if this one says, "That which made you unclean did not make me unclean, but you have made me unclean." 
If a rooster swallowed a <em>sheretz</em> and fell within the air-space of an oven, the oven remains pure. If the rooster died, the oven becomes impure. If a <em>sheretz</em> was found in an oven, any bread in it contracts second degree impurity since the oven is of the first degree.  
If a leavening pot with a tightly fitting lid was put in an oven, and there was some leaven and a <em>sheretz</em> within the pot, but there was a partition of inedible bread between them, the oven is impure but the leaven is pure. But if there was was an olive's bulk of a corpse [in the pot] both the oven and the house are impure, but the leaven remains pure. If in the partition [in the leaven pot] there was an opening of one handbreadth, all become impure. 
If a <em>sheretz</em> was found in the eye-hole of an oven or of a double stove or of a single stove: If it was outside the inner edge, [the oven or stove] is pure. If it [the oven] was in the open air, even if it was an olive's bulk of corpse, it is pure. If there was [in the eye-hole] an opening of one handbreadth, it is all impure. 
If [<em>sheretz</em>] was found in the [place in a stove] where wood is put - Rabbi Yehudah says: If it was within the outer edge, [the stove] becomes impure. But the Sages say: If it was outside the inner edge [the stove] remains pure. Rabbi Yose says: If it was found beneath the spot where the pot is placed and inwards, [the stove] becomes impure, but if it is beneath the spot where the pot is set and outwards, it remains pure. If it was found on the place where the bath-keeper sits, or where the dyer sits, or where the olive-boilers sit, [the stove] remains pure. It only becomes impure when [the <em>sheretz</em>] is found in the enclosed part and inwards. 
A pit [smelting furnace] which has a place on which a pot may be set is subject to ritual impurity. And so also an oven of glass-blowers, if it has a place on which a pot may be set, it is subject to impurity. The furnace of lime-burners, or of glaziers, or of potters is not subject to impurity.  A large oven: If it has a rim, it is subject to impurity. Rabbi Yehudah says: If it has coverings. Rabban Gamliel says: if it has edges.   
If a person who came in contact with one who has contracted corpse impurity had food or liquids in his mouth, and he put his head into the air-space of an oven that was pure, they cause the oven to become impure. If a person who was ritually pure had food or liquids in his mouth, and he put his head into the air-space of an oven that was impure, [the food and drink] become impure. If a person was eating a pressed fig with impure hands, and he put his hand into his mouth to remove a small stone: Rabbi Meir declares [the fig] to be impure. But Rabbi Yehudah declares it pure. Rabbi Yose says: If he turned it over [in his mouth] it [the fig] is impure, but if he did not turn it over [the fig] is pure. If the person had a coin in his mouth, Rabbi Yose says: if he kept it there to relieve his thirst, it becomes impure.  
If [an impure] woman had milk dripping from her breasts, and it fell into the air-space of an oven, the oven becomes impure, since a liquid conveys impurity regardless of whether one wanted it there or not. If she was sweeping [the oven] out, and a thorn pricked her and she bled, or if she burnt herself and put her finger into her mouth, the oven becomes impure.   

Chapter 9

A needle or a ring which was found in the floor of an oven, and they can be seen but they don't stick out into the oven, if one bakes dough and it touches them, the [oven] is unclean.
Regarding which dough did they speak?
With regard to edium dough.
If they are found in the plaster of an oven with a tightly fitting lid:
If the oven is unclean, they are unclean, 
If the oven is clean, they are clean.
If they are found in the stopper of a jar:
If on the sides, they are unclean.
If opposite the mouth, they are clean.
If they can be seen in it, but they do not enter its airspace, they are clean.
If they sink into it, and there is [plaster] underneath them as thick as garlic peel, they are clean.

A jar that was full of clean liquids, with a siphon in it, and it had a tightly fitting cover and it was in a tent in which there was a corpse: 
Bet Shammai says: both the jar and the liquids are clean but the siphon is unclean.
And Bet Hillel says: the siphon also is clean. 
Bet Hillel changed their mind and ruled in agreement with Bet Shammai. 

A creepy crawly thing which was found beneath the bottom of an oven, the oven remains clean, for I can say that it fell there while it was still alive and that it died only now.   
A needle or a ring which was found beneath the bottom of an oven, the oven remains clean, for I can say that they were there before the oven arrived. 
If it was found in the wood ashes, the oven is unclean since there is nothing upon which to base an assumption [of cleanness].

A sponge which had absorbed unclean liquids and its outer surface became dry and it fell into the air-space of an oven, the oven is unclean, for the liquid would eventually come out. 
And the same with regard to a piece of turnip or reed grass.   
Rabbi Shimon declares [the oven] clean in both these cases. 

Potsherds that had been used for unclean liquids which fell into the air-space of an oven, if the oven was heated, it becomes unclean, for the liquid would eventually come out.   
And the same with regard to fresh olive peat, but if it was old, the oven remains clean.
If it was known that liquid comes out, even after three years, the oven becomes unclean. 

Olive peat or grape skins which had been prepared in cleanness, and unclean persons trod upon them and afterwards liquids came out from them, they remain clean, since they had originally been prepared in conditions of cleanness.   
A spindle hook which was sunk into the spindle, or the iron point into the ox goad, or a ring into a brick, and all these were clean, and then they went into a tent in which there was a corpse, they become unclean.   
If a zav shifted them they become unclean.   
If they then fell into the air-space of a clean oven, they cause it to be unclean.   
If a loaf of terumah came in contact with them, it remains clean.

Netting which placed over the mouth of an oven, forming a tightly fitting lid, and a split appeared between the oven and the netting, the minimum size [to allow impurity to enter] is that of the circumference of the tip of an ox goad that cannot actually enter it.   
Rabbi Judah says: one into which [the tip] can actually enter.   
If the netting was split, the minimum size is the circumference of the tip of an ox goad that can enter it.   
Rabbi Judah says: even if it cannot enter.   
If the split was round they do not regard it as straight, and still the minimum size must be the circumference of the tip of an ox goad that can actually enter.

An oven into which a hole  had been put in its "eye", the minimum size [for it to leave the category of being tightly closed] is the circumference of a spindle staff that can enter and come out while burning [without being extinguished].   
Rabbi Judah says: one that is not burning.   
If the hole was at its side, the minimum size must be that of the circumference of a spindle staff that can enter and come out while it is not burning.   
Rabbi Judah says: while burning.   
Rabbi Shimon says: if the hole is in the middle its size must be large enough so that it can actually enter, but if it was at the side it need be able to actually enter. 
And similarly he used to say concerning the stopper of a jar which was pierced: the minimum size is the circumference of the second knot in an rye stalk. If the hole was in the middle the stalk it must be able to enter, and if at the side it need not be able to enter. 
And similarly he used to say concerning large stone jars whose stoppers became pierced. The minimum size is the circumference of the second knot in a reed. If the hole was in the middle the reed must be able to enter it, and if it was at the side the reed need not be able to enter it. 
When is this so? When the jars were made for wine, but if they were made for other liquids, if they have even the smallest hole, they are unclean.   
When is this so? When the holes were not made by a person, but if they were made by a person, if they have even the smallest hole, they are unclean.   
If [a different vessel] was pierced [the rule ] is as follows: if the vessel was used for food, it must be large enough to let olives can fall out; if for liquids, one that lets out liquids; 
If for both, they impose the greater restriction [with regard to the issue of] a tightly fitting cover [the size of the hole need only be] one that admits a liquid. 


Chapter 10

The following vessels protect their contents when they have a tightly fitting cover:  those made of cattle dung, of stone, of clay, of earthenware, of sodium carbonate, of the bones of a fish or of its skin, or of the bones of any animal of the sea or of its skin, and wooden vessels that are always clean. 
They protect whether the covers close their mouths or their sides, whether they stand on their bottoms or lean on their sides. 
If they were turned over with their mouths downwards they afford protection to all that is beneath them to the deep. 
Rabbi Eliezer declares this unclean. 
These protect everything, except that an earthen vessel protects only foods, liquids and earthen vessels.   

How do they tightly fit the cover?   
With lime or gypsum, pitch or wax, mud or excrement, crude clay or potter's clay, or any substance that is used for plastering. 
One may not make a tightly fitting cover with tin or with lead because though it is a covering, it is not tightly fitting. 
One may not make a tightly fitting cover with swollen fig-cakes or with dough that was kneaded with fruit juice, since it might cause it to become unfit.  
If he did make a tightly fitting cover [from such material] it protects.

A stopper of a jar that is loose but does not fall out:
Rabbi Judah says: it protects.
But the sages say: it does not protect. 
If its finger-hold was sunk within the jar and a creepy crawly thing was in it, the jar becomes unclean.
If the creepy crawly thing was in the jar, any food in it becomes unclean.

A ball or coil of reed grass which he placed over the mouth of a jar: if its sides were plastered, it does not protect unless it was also plastered above or below.   
The same is true with regard to a patch of cloth.   
If it was of paper or leather and bound with a cord, if he plastered it from the sides, it protects.

A jar whose outer layer had been peeled off but its pitch [lining] remained intact,   
And similarly pots of fish brine which were sealed up with gypsum at a level with the brim:
Rabbi Judah says: they do not protect.
But the sages say: they do protect.

A jar which had a hole in it and wine lees stopped it up, they protect it.   
If he stopped it up with a vine shoot [it does not protect] until he plasters it at the sides.   
If there were two vine shoots, [it does not protect] unless he plastered it at the sides and also between the one shoot and the other. 
If a board was placed over the mouth of an oven, it protects if he plastered it at the sides.  
If there were two boards [it does not protect] unless he plastered at the sides and also between the one board and the other. 
If they were fastened together with pegs or with bamboo joints there is no need for them to be plastered in the middle. 

An old oven which was within a new one and netting was over the mouth of the old [new] one:
If the old one were to be removed the netting would drop, it is unclean;   
But if it not, it is all clean.   
A new oven was within an old one and netting was over the mouth of the old one—if there was not a handbreadth of space between the new oven and the netting,  all the contents of the new one are clean.   
[Earthenware] pans one placed within the other and their rims were on the same level, and there was a creepy crawly thing in the upper one or in the lower one, that pan alone becomes unclean but all the others remain clean.   
If [they were perforated] to the extent of admitting a liquid, and the creepy crawly thing was in the uppermost one, all become unclean.
If in the lowest one, that one is unclean while the others remain clean.   
If the creepy crawly thing was in the uppermost one and the lowest projected above it, both are unclean.   
If the creepy crawly thing was in the uppermost one and the lowest projected above it, any one that contained dripping liquid becomes unclean.


Chapter 11

Metal vessels, whether they are simple or form a receptacle, are susceptible to impurity. 
If they break they become clean.  
If they were re-made into vessels they revert to their former impurity. 
Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: this does not apply to every form of impurity but only to that contracted from a corpse.

Every metal vessel that has a name of its own is susceptible to impurity, except for a door, a bolt, a lock, a socket under a hinge, a hinge, a clapper, and the [threshold] groove under a door post, since these are intended to be attached to the ground. 

One who makes vessels from iron ore, from smelted iron, from the hoop of a wheel, from sheets, from plating, from the bases, rims or handles of vessels, from chippings or filings, they are clean.  
Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri says: even from those made of pieces of vessels. 
From pieces of vessels, from pieces of old vessels, or from nails that were known to have been made from vessels, are unclean.  
From ordinary nails: 
Bet Shammai says: they are unclean,   
And Bet Hillel says that they are clean.

Unclean iron which he smelted together with clean iron: if the greater part was from the unclean iron, [the vessel made from the mixture] is unclean; if the greater part was from the clean iron, the vessel is clean. 
If each was half, it is unclean.   
The same law also applies to a mixture of cement and cattle dung.   
A door bolt is susceptible to impurity, but [one of wood] that is  covered with metal is not susceptible to impurity.   
The clutch and the crosspiece [of a lock] are susceptible to impurity. 
A door-bolt: 
Rabbi Joshua says: he may remove it from one door and hang it on another on Shabbat.

But the sages says that only the scorpion-bit  is susceptible to impurity, 
When they are joined together it is all susceptible to impurity.

All women's ornaments are susceptible to impurity: a golden city (a tiara), a necklace, ear-rings, finger-rings, a ring whether it has a seal or does not have a seal, and nose-rings. 
A necklace which has metal beads on a thread of flax or wool and the thread broke, the beads are still susceptible to impurity, since each one is a vessel in itself. 
A thread of metal and the beads were of precious stones or pearls or glass, and the beads were broken while the thread alone remained, it is still susceptible to impurity. 
The remnants of a necklace [are susceptible] as long as there is enough for the neck of a little girl. 
Rabbi Eliezer says: even if only one ring remained it is susceptible, for they hang it around the neck.

If an earring was shaped like a pot at its bottom and like a lentil at the top and it fell apart, the pot-shaped section is susceptible to impurity because it is a receptacle, while the lentil shaped section is susceptible to impurity in itself.   
The hook is clean. 
If it was in the shape of a cluster of grapes and it fell apart, they   are clean.

Rabbi Shimon says: if it cannot be lifted up by these walls it is clean.  
The pomegranates of which they have spoken--three attached to one another.      Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: in a sifter or a sieve [the size of the hole must be such that a pomegranate will drop out] when one picks it up and walks about with it. In a basket it must be such [as would allow a pomegranate] to fall through while he hangs it behind him. And all other vessels which  cannot hold pomegranates as, for instance, the quarter kav measure and the half quarter kav measure, and small baskets, the size  [of their holes must be] such as would extend over the greater part of  them, the words of Rabbi Meir.  Rabbi Shimon says: [the size of their hole must be such that] olives [could fall through].      If their sides were broken [the size of their hole must be] such as olives would drop through.  If they are worn away the size must be such as would allow the objects which are usually kept in them [to drop through]. 
The pomegranate that is spoken of is neither small nor big, but medium-sized. Why is a Badan pomegranate mentioned? Because they consecrate even with the smallest amount, these are the words of R. Meir. R. Yohanan ben Nuri says, to measure the utensils with them. R. Akiva says, they were mentioned for both reasons, to measure the utensils with them and because they consecrate even with the smallest amount. R. Yose said, Badan pomegranates and Geba leeks were only mentioned because they need to be tithed with certainty in any place.  
"Like [the measurement of] an egg" that was said, is neither big nor small, but medium-sized. R. Yehudah says, Bring the biggest of the big and the smallest of the small, put them in water, and divide the water [that is displaced]. R. Yose said, Who will tell me which is big and which is small? Rather, it is according to the understanding of the observer. 
"Like [the measurement of] a dried fig" that was said, is neither big nor small, but medium-sized. R. Yehudah says, The biggest in the land of Israel is the medium-sized of other lands.
An olive of which they have said, not large and not small, but average, this is good for storage.  The barley of which they have said,  it is not large and it is not small, but it is average, this is the wilderness.  The lentil of which they have said, it is not large and it is not small, but it is average, this is the Egyptian.  All movable goods impart impurity if the thickness of a shepherd's staff, not large and not small, but average.  What is average? Any which has a circumference of a handbreadth. 
The cubit that they have spoken [about], it is an average cubit, and two cubits were in the palace of Shushan, one in the northeastern corner and one in the southeastern corner. The one which was in the northeastern corner was greater than that of Moses by half a fingerbreadth. The one that was in the southwestern corner was greater than it by half a fingerbreadth, it is found that it is greater than that of Moses by a fingerbreadth.  And why did they say one large and one small, but that the workmen could take according to the small and return according to the large, so that they would not commit sacrilege. 
Rabbi Meir says: all cubits  were of the moderate length  except that for the golden altar, the horns,  the surround  and the  base.      Rabbi Judah says: the cubit used for the building  was one of six  handbreadths and that for the vessels was of five handbreadths.   
And sometimes they stated a smaller measure: Liquid and dry measures  were measured with the Italian standard which was the one that was used in the wilderness.      Sometimes they stated [a measure]  according to the individual concerned:  One who takes the handful of a grain offering,      One who takes both hands full of incense, One who  drinks a cheek full on Yom Kippur,      And the two meals for an eruv,    Food for the weekday and not Shabbat, the words of Rabbi Meir.  Rabbi Judah says: for Shabbat but not for the weekday.      And both intended to give the more lenient ruling.      Rabbi Shimon says: two thirds of a loaf, when three [loaves] are made of a kav [of flour].     Rabbi Yohanan ben Beroka says: a loaf that is purchased for a pundium [when the price of wheat] is four se'ah for a sela’. 
And sometimes  they stated a large measure:  A ladleful of corpse mold refers to the big ladle of doctors;  The split bean in the case of skin disease  refers to the Cilician kind;  One who eats on Yom Kippur a quantity of the bulk of a large date, refers to the size of the date and its pit;  In the case of skins of wine and oil [the holes] must be as big as their large stopper;  In the case of a hole for light that was not made by human hands  the minimum size of  which is that of a large fist, the reference is to the fist of Ben Batiah.      Rabbi Yose said: and it is as big as a large human head.  And in the case of one made by human hands the prescribed size  is that of the  large drill in the Temple chamber which is the size of the Italian pondium or the Neronian sela  or like the hole in a yoke.   
Anything that lives in the sea is clean, except the sea-dog because it seeks refuge on dry land, the words of Rabbi Akiba.  If one made vessels from what grows in the sea and joined to them anything that grows on land, even if only a thread or a cord, if it is susceptible to uncleanness, they are unclean. 
There are things that were created on the first day that are susceptible to impurity.      On the second day, nothing created is susceptible to uncleanness.      On the third day, there are things susceptible to uncleanness.      On the fourth day and on the fifth day nothing created is susceptible to uncleanness except for  the wing of the vulture or an ostrich-egg that is plated.      Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri said:  why should the wing of a vulture be different from all other wings?   Anything created on the sixth day is susceptible to uncleanness. 
One who makes a receptacle whatever its size it is susceptible to uncleanness.  One who makes a couch or a bed whatever its purpose it is susceptible to uncleanness.  One who makes a wallet from untanned hide or from papyrus it is susceptible to uncleanness.  A pomegranate, an acorn and a nut which children hollowed out to  measure dust or fixed them into a pair of scales, are susceptible to uncleanness, since in the case of children an act is valid though an intention is not. 
An arm of a scale or the leveling-rod that has a compartment in it for metal, and the yoke that has a compartment in it for money, and a poor person's cane that has a compartment in it for water, and a walking stick that has a compartment in it for a mezuzah or pearls -- these are susceptible to uncleanness. And about all of these Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai said, "Woe is me if I speak! Woe is me if I do not speak!"
The base of the goldsmiths’ anvil is susceptible to uncleanness, but that of the blacksmiths is clean.  A sharpening-board which has a receptacle for oil is susceptible to uncleanness, but one that has none is clean.  A writing-tablet that has a receptacle for wax is susceptible to uncleanness, but one that has none is clean.  A straw  mat or a tube of straw:  Rabbi Akiva declares it is susceptible to uncleanness; But Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri declares it clean.  Rabbi Shimon says: the hollow stalk of colocynth is subject to the same law.        A mat of reeds or rushes is clean.  A reed-tube that he cut for receiving anything remains clean until he removes all the pith.  

Chapter 18

A wooden chest:  
Beth Shammai says: it is measured on the  inside;  
And Bet Hillel says: it is measured on the outside.   
Both agree that the thickness of the legs and the thickness of the rim are not measured. 
Rabbi Yose says: both agree that the thickness of the legs and the thickness of the rim are measured but the space between them is not measured. 
Rabbi Shimon Shezuri says: if the legs are one handbreadth high the space between them is not measured, and if not they are measured. 

Its carriage: if it can be slipped off, it is not regarded as connected, nor is it included in its measurement, nor does it afford protection together with it in the tent of a corpse, nor may it be dragged on Shabbat when there is money in it.     
If it cannot be slipped off, it is regarded as connected, it is included in its measurement, it affords protection together with it in the tent of a corpse, it may be dragged on Shabbat even if it contains money. 
Its arched top, if it is fixed [to the box], is considered connected and is measured with it, but if it is not fixed it is not connected and is not measured with it. 
How is it measured? As an ox-head.     
Rabbi Judah says: if it cannot stand by itself it is clean.

A chest, a box or a cupboard from which one of the legs was removed, even though it is still capable of holding [things], it is clean.
If it cannot hold [things] in the usual manner.     
Rabbi Yose says: it is susceptible to impurity. 
The poles of a bed, its base, and [its] covering are clean.     
Only the bed itself and its rectangle [frame] are susceptible to uncleanness. 
The rectangle frames of the Levites are clean.

A bed frame that they put on props:
Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Judah say it is susceptible to uncleanness.
But Rabbi Yose and Rabbi Shimon say that it is clean. 
Rabbi Yose said: Why is this different from the rectangle frames of the Levites which are clean?

A bed that had contracted midras uncleanness:
If a short side was removed and its two legs it is unclean.
But if a long side and two legs were removed it becomes clean. 
Rabbi Nehemiah says: it is unclean. 
If he chopped off two props at opposite corners , or if he chopped off two legs at opposite corners, or if he reduced the bed to less than a handbreadth high, it becomes clean. 

A bed that had contracted midras impurity: 
If the long side of it was broken and then he repaired it, it still retains its midras impurity. 
If the second side was also broke and then he repaired it, it becomes pure from midras impurity but is unclean due to contact with midras.    
If he didn't have a chance to repair the first side before the second side broke, the bed becomes clean.  

A [bed] leg that had contracted midras uncleanness and he joined it to a bed, all the bed contracts midras uncleanness. 
If he removed it, it retains its midras uncleanness while the bed is unclean due to contact with midras. 
If a bed leg that was subject to a seven-day uncleanness was joined to a bed, all the bed contracts seven-day uncleanness. 
If he removed it it remains subject to seven-day uncleanness while the bed is only subject to evening-uncleanness.     
If a leg that was subject to evening uncleanness was joined to a bed, all the bed contracts evening uncleanness. 
If he subsequently removed it it is still subject to evening uncleanness and the bed becomes clean.     
The same law applies also to the prong of a mattock.

A tefillin box consisting of four vessels: if he loosened the first compartment, and then he fixed it, it retains its corpse uncleanness. 
So too with the second and the third.     
If he loosened the fourth it becomes clean from corpse uncleanness but it is still unclean from contact with corpse uncleanness.     
If he went back to the first compartment and loosened it and mended it, it remains unclean from contact.    
So too with the second.     
If he then loosened the third compartment and fixed it, it becomes clean, since the fourth is unclean from contact, and what is unclean from contact cannot convey uncleanness by contact.

A bed, half of which was stolen or lost, or one which brothers or joint owners divided, becomes clean.      
If they returned it, it is susceptible to uncleanness from that point onwards.     
A bed may contract uncleanness and be purified when all its parts are bound together, the words of Rabbi Eliezer. 
But the sages say: it can contract uncleanness and be purified in parts.


Chapter 19

One who takes apart a bed in order to immerse it and [while doing so] touches the ropes remains clean.   
The rope: when does it begin to be considered connected with the bed? 
Once he knots three rows of meshes.   
And [if another rope was tied to this one] and a person touches it: 
If from the knot inwards he becomes unclean; 
But if from the knot outwards he remains clean. 
As to the loose ends of the knot, any one that touches that part which is needed for it becomes unclean. 
And how much is needed for it?  Rabbi Judah says: three fingerbreadths.


A rope that hangs out from a bed:   
If it is shorter than five handbreadths, it is clean, 
If it is from five to ten handbreadths long, it is unclean.
From ten handbreadths and longer is clean; 
For it is with [this rope]  that they tie up paschal lambs and lower down beds.

A part of a mattress that hangs over the bed, [it is unclean] whatever  its length, the words of Rabbi Meir. 
Rabbi Yose says: up to ten handbreadths.     
The remnant of a mattress remains unclean if the length is at least seven handbreadths, enough to make a donkey's covering.

If he carried a zav on a bed and on its mattress, [the latter] causes an uncleanness of two grades and an unfitness of one grade, the words of Rabbi Meir. 
Rabbi Yose says: if he carried a zav on a bed and on its mattress the part that is shorter than ten handbreadths it causes an  uncleanness of two grades and an unfitness of one grade, but if it is  over the ten handbreadths it causes only an uncleanness of one grade and an unfitness of one grade.     
If he carried [a zav] on the mattress, [on the overhanging part] that was shorter than ten handbreadths, it becomes unclean, but if on the part that was longer than ten handbreadths it remains clean.

A bed that had midras uncleanness and one wrapped a mattress around it, the whole becomes subject to midras uncleanness. 
If he removed it, the bed remains subject to midras uncleanness but the mattress is unclean only from contact with midras. 
If it had seven-day uncleanness and one wrapped a mattress around it, the whole becomes subject to seven-day uncleanness. 
If he removed it, the bed remains subject to seven-day uncleanness but the mattress is unclean until the evening. 
If the bed was subject to evening uncleanness and around it he wrapped a mattress, the whole becomes subject to evening uncleanness; 
If he removed it, the bed remains subject to evening uncleanness but the mattress becomes clean.

If he wrapped a mattress around a bed and a corpse touched them, they are subject to a seven-day uncleanness;     
If they are taken apart they are still subject to a seven-day uncleanness. 
If  a sheretz touched them they are subject to an evening uncleanness; 
If they are taken apart they are still subject to evening uncleanness. 
A bed from which the two longer sides were removed  and  two new ones were made for it but he didn't change the original sockets:
If the new sides were broken the bed retains its uncleanness,     
But if the old ones were broken it becomes clean, since everything depends on the old ones.

A box whose opening is at the top is susceptible to corpse uncleanness.     
If it was damaged above it is still susceptible to corpse uncleanness. 
If it was damaged below, it becomes clean. 
The compartments within it remain unclean and are not regarded as a connected to it.

A shepherd's bag whose pocket was damaged, [the pocket] within it retains its uncleanness and is not regarded as a connected to it. 
A skin whose testicle bags serve also as receptacles and they were damaged, they become clean, since they will no longer serve their original purpose.
A box whose opening is at its side is susceptible to both midras uncleanness  and corpse uncleanness. 
Rabbi Yose said: When does this apply? When it is less than ten handbreadths in height or when it does not have a rim one handbreadth deep.     
If it was damaged above it is still susceptible to corpse uncleanness.     
If it was damaged below:
Rabbi Meir declares it susceptible to uncleanness.     
But the sages declare it clean because if the primary function is annulled the secondary one is also annulled.

A dung-basket that was damaged so that it will not hold pomegranates: 
Rabbi Meir declares it susceptible to uncleanness,      
But the sages say that it is clean because if the primary function is annulled the secondary one is also annulled.


Chapter 20

Pillows, bed coverings, sacks and packing cases that were damaged are still susceptible to midras uncleanness.   
A fodder-bag that can hold four kav, a shepherd's bag that can hold five kav, a  traveling bag that can hold a se'ah, a skin that can hold seven kav, Rabbi Judah adds: also a spice-bag, and a food wallet that can hold the smallest quantity are susceptible to midras uncleanness.   
If any of them was damaged it becomes clean, since if the primary function is annulled the secondary function is  also annulled.  

A bagpipe is not susceptible to midras uncleanness.   
A trough for mixing mortar:
Bet Shammai says: it is susceptible to midras uncleanness ,
And Bet Hillel says it is susceptible to corpse  uncleanness [only].   
A trough that can hold two log to nine kav which becomes split, it becomes susceptible to midras uncleanness.     
If he left it out in the rain and it became damaged it is susceptible to corpse uncleanness [only].
[If he left it out] during the east wind and it split, it is susceptible to midras uncleanness.     
This is a stringency in the case of remnants of wooden vessels that is more than [that of such vessels] in their original condition.     
There is also a stringency in regard to the remnants of wicker vessels than [to such vessels] as are in their original condition, for when they are in their original condition they are insusceptible to uncleanness until their rim is finished, but after their rim has been finished, even though their edges fell away leaving only the smallest amount, they are unclean.

A stick which was he made into a handle for a hatchet, it is regarded as connected for uncleanness at the time of use. 
A yarn winder is regarded as connected for uncleanness at the time of its use. 
If he fixed it to a pole it is susceptible to uncleanness, but it is not considered connected to it. 
If he made the pole itself into a yarn winder, only that part which is needed for use is susceptible to uncleanness. 
A seat that he fixed to a pole is susceptible to uncleanness, but it is not regarded as connected to it. 
If he made the pole itself  into a seat, only the place of the seat is susceptible to uncleanness. 
[If he fixed a seat] to the beam of an olive-press it is susceptible to uncleanness, but it is not regarded as connected to it. 
If he made the end of a beam into a seat it remains clean, because people would say to him, "Get up and let us do our work."

A large trough which was so damaged that it could no longer hold pomegranates and he fixed it to be used as a seat: 
Rabbi Akiva declares it susceptible to uncleanness, 
But the sages declare it clean until he smooths out its rough parts.    
If he made it into a feeding bowl for cattle, even if he fixed it to a wall, it is susceptible to uncleanness.

A wood block  that he fixed to a row on a wall, whether he fixed it and did not built upon it or built upon it but did not fix it, it is susceptible to uncleanness.     
If he fixed it and also built upon it, it is clean.     
Matting that he spread over roof-beams, whether he fixed it but did not put on the plasterwork or whether he put on the plasterwork but did not fix it, it is susceptible to uncleanness.      
If he fixed it and he laid plasterwork over it, it is clean.     
A dish that he fixed to a chest, box or cupboard: 
If in such a manner as to hold its contents in the usual way, it is susceptible to uncleanness,     
But if it was in a manner that it cannot hold its contents in the usual way  it is clean.

A sheet that is susceptible to uncleanness by midras and is used as a curtain is not susceptible to uncleanness from the midras, but it is susceptible to uncleanness by a corpse. When is it not susceptible to it [uncleanness by midras]? Beit Shammai says, when it is torn. Beit Hillel says, when it is tied. Rabbi Akiva says, when it is hung.
A mat on which reeds are put lengthwise is not susceptible to uncleanness. The sages say, only if they are in the form of [the Greek letter] chi. If they were laid along its width and there were not four handbreadths between each reed, it is not susceptible to uncleanness. If it were divided along its width, Rabbi Yehuda [says] it is not susceptible to uncleanness. So, too, if the end knots [of reed matting] are untied, it is not susceptible to uncleanness. If it were divided along its length and three knots of six handbreadths were left on it, it is susceptible to uncleanness. A mat -- when does it become susceptible to uncleanness? When it is trimmed, and its production is complete.

Chapter 21

One who touches the upper beam, the lower beam, the harnesses, the slay, the thread that they draw over the purple material, or a spool which is not to be sent back, remains clean.   
[If he touches] the woof, the standing warp, the double thread that is drawn over purple material or a spool which is to be sent back, he becomes unclean.   
One who touches the wool that is on the distaff, or on the spool, he remains clean. 
If he touches the spinner: 
Before it was uncovered  he is unclean, 
After it was uncovered he remains clean. 

One who touches the yoke, the crossbar, the collar-piece, or the thick ropes, even when they are being used, he remains clean.      
If he touched the tail piece, knee or handle, he becomes unclean. 
[If he touched] the metal rings, the guides, or the flanks, he becomes unclean. 
Rabbi Judah says that he remains clean if he touched the guides since they are only made to increase the soil.

One who touches the handle of a saw at this end or that end  becomes unclean;    
[If he touched] its string, cord, cross-piece or side-pieces, a carpenter's vice, or the bow-handle of a bow-drill, he remains clean.     
Rabbi Judah says: also one who touches the frame of a large saw remains clean. 
One who touches the bow-string or the bow, even though it was stretched, he remains clean.     
A mole-trap is clean.     
Rabbi Judah says: as long as it is stretched, the separate parts are [regarded as] connected.  


Chapter 22

If a table or a side-board was damaged or he covered them with marble but room was left for cups to be set, it is unclean. 
Rabbi Judah ruled: there must be room enough for pieces of food.
A table one of whose legs was removed is clean.   
If a second leg was removed it is still clean. 
But if a third was removed it becomes unclean when the owner has the intention of using it.     
Rabbi Yose says: no intention is necessary.     
The same law applies also to the side-board.
A bench, one of whose legs was removed, is clean.     
If its second leg also was removed it is still clean. 
If it was one handbreadth high it is unclean. 
A footstool one of whose legs was removed is unclean.
The same applies to the chair in front of a cathedra.

A bride's stool whose coverings for the seatboards:
Bet Shammai rules that it still susceptible to uncleanness,     
And Bet Hillel rules that it is clean.     
Shammai rules: even the frame of the stool  is susceptible to uncleanness. 
A stool which was fixed to a kneading-trough,     
Bet Shammai rules that it susceptible to uncleanness,     
And Bet Hillel rules that it is clean.
Shammai rules: even one made out of it is susceptible to uncleanness.
A chair whose seat boards did not project and then they were removed, it is still susceptible to uncleanness, for it is usual  to turn it on its side and to sit on it.
A chair whose middle seat board was removed but the outer ones  remained, it is still susceptible to uncleanness. 
If the outer ones were removed and the middle seat board remained it is also  susceptible to uncleanness. 
Rabbi Shimon says: only if it was a handbreadth wide.
A chair, of which two seat boards were removed, this one next to this one:  
Rabbi Akiva says: it is susceptible to impurity; 
And the sages say that it is clean. 
Rabbi Judah said: so too the seat boards of a bride's chair which were removed and receptacle remained, it is clean, since where the primary function is annulled,  the secondary one is also annulled. 

A chest whose top part was removed is still susceptible to uncleanness on account of its bottom; 
If its bottom was removed it is still susceptible to uncleanness on account of its top part.     
If both the top part and the bottom part were removed: 
Rabbi Judah says that it is susceptible to uncleanness on account of its sides,     
But the sages rule that it is clean. 
A stonecutter's seat is subject to midras uncleanness.

A [wooden] block which was painted red or saffron, or was polished: 
Rabbi Akiva says that it is susceptible to uncleanness,     
But the sages say that it remains clean until he carves out [a seat].     
A small basket or a big one that was filled with straw or other soft material [even] if he set it up to be a seat, remains clean.
But if he plaited it over with reed-grass or with a cord it becomes susceptible to uncleanness.

A toilet is subject to both midras and corpse uncleanness. 
If it was taken apart, the leather is subject to midras uncleanness and the iron is subject only to corpse uncleanness.

If it was taken apart, the leather is subject to midras uncleanness while the stool is altogether clean. 
Benches in the bathhouse bench that have two wooden legs are susceptible to uncleanness.     
If one leg was of wood and the other of stone it is clean. 
Boards in a bath-house which he  joined together:
Rabbi Akiva says that they are susceptible to [midras] uncleanness;     
But the sages say that they are clean, since they are made only for the water to flow under them.
A fumigation-cage that contains a receptacle for garments is susceptible to uncleanness,     
But one that is made like a bee-hive is clean.


Chapter 23

A ball, a mold, an amulet or tefillin which were torn, one that touches them becomes unclean,   
But one that touches what is inside them remains clean. 
A saddle which was torn, one that touches its contents unclean, because the stitching joins them.

The following are susceptible to uncleanness as objects that are fit for riding upon (merkav): an Ashkelon donkey belt, a Medean saddle, a camel's pillow, and a horse-cloth.     
Rabbi Yose says: a horse-cloth is susceptible to uncleanness  as a seat, since people stand on it  in the arena.
But a saddle of a female camel is susceptible to [sitting] uncleanness.

What is the practical difference between [the uncleanness of an object used for] riding upon and [one used for] sitting upon? 
With the case of riding upon there is a difference between contact with it and carrying it, but in the case of siting upon it there is no difference between contact with it and carrying it.     
The pack-frame of a donkey on which a zav sat is clean;      
But if he changed the size of the spaces or if they have been broken one into another it is susceptible to uncleanness.

The bier, the mattress and the pillow of a corpse are susceptible to midras uncleanness.

One used for books is susceptible to corpse uncleanness;    
And the one used as a shroud or a covering for the harps of the Levites is free from all uncleanness.

There are three different types of hip-boots: 
Those used by the hunters of wild animals and birds are susceptible to midras uncleanness;
Those used by locust gatherers are susceptible to corpse uncleanness.
And those used by fig-pickers are free from all uncleanness.  

There are three different types of hair nets: 
A girl's is susceptible to midras uncleanness; 
An old woman's is susceptible to corpse uncleanness; 
And of a woman who "goes out" is free from all uncleanness.  

There are three different types of baskets: 
If a worn-out basket that he patched on to a sound one,  all is determined by the sound one;     
A small basket on to a large one,  all is determined by the large one;    
If they are equal, all is determined by the inner one.     
Rabbi Shimon says: if he patched the cup of a balance on to the bottom of a boiler on the inside, it is unclean; but if on the outside it remains clean. 
If he patched it on to the side, whether on the inside or the outside, it remains clean. 


Chapter 25

All vessels have [different laws] for outer and inner sides, for instance, cushions, coverings, sacks and packing-bags, the words of Rabbi Judah. 
Rabbi Meir says: any vessel that has loops has [different laws] for inner and outer sides but one that has no loops does not have different laws for outer and inner sides.
A table and a side-board  have [different laws] for outer and inner sides, the words of Rabbi Judah. 
Rabbi Meir says: they do not have a different law for their outer sides.   
The same applies to a frame that has no rim.

An ox-goad has different laws for its outer and inner parts, 
[The outer part is] the seven handbreadths from the broad blade and four handbreadths from the point, the words of Rabbi Judah. 
Rabbi Meir says: it is not to [subject to such distinction],  they mentioned the four and the seven handbreadths  only in regard to its remnants.

Measuring cups of wine or oil, a fork-ladle, a mustard-strainer and a wine-filter have an outer and inner side, the words of Rabbi Meir. 
Rabbi Judah says: they do not have.     
Rabbi Shimon says: they do have, for if their outer parts contracted uncleanness that which is inside remains clean, and he must immerse them.

A quarter [of a log] and half a quarter [of a log], if the quarter measure contracted uncleanness, the half-quarter measure does not become unclean, and if the half-quarter contracted uncleanness the quarter does not become unclean. 
They said in front of Rabbi Akiva:  since the half quarter measure is the outer part of the quarter measure, should not the outer side of the vessel whose inner side contracted uncleanness become unclean? 
He answered them: Are you sure that it belongs to the earlier category [of vessels that have inner and outer parts]? Perhaps the quarter is to be regarded as the outer side of the half quarter and, surely, the inner side of a vessel does not become unclean if the outer side contracted uncleanness. 

If the [inside of the] quarter contracted uncleanness, the quarter and its outer side are unclean, but the half quarter and its outer side remain clean.     
If the [inside of the] half quarter contracted uncleanness, the half quarter and its outer side are unclean, but the quarter and its outer side remain clean. 
If the outer side of the quarter contracted uncleanness,the outer side of the half quarter remains clean, the words of Rabbi Meir. 
But the sages say: they cannot divide the outer side.     
When he immerses the vessel, he must immerse the whole thing.

The bases, rims, hangers or handles of vessels that have a receptacle on which an [unclean] liquid fell, one dries them and they remain clean. 
But for other vessesl which cannot hold pomegranates or in which no distinction is made between its outer and inner sides, if [unclean] liquid fell on any part, the whole becomes unclean. 
If the outer side of a vessel contracted uncleanness from a liquid, only its outer side is unclean but its inner side, rim, hanger and handles remain clean. 
If its inner side contracted uncleanness the whole is unclean. 

All vessels have outer and inner sides and have a part by which they are held.     
Rabbi Tarfon says: this applies only to a large wooden [kneading] trough. 
Rabbi Akiva says: it applies to cups. 
Rabbi Meir says: it applies to unclean and clean hands. 
Rabbi Yose says: they said this only concerning clean hands.

How so?     
If one's hands were clean and the outer side of a cup was unclean, one may hold it by its holding-place and need not be concerned lest his hands have contracted uncleanness from the outer side of the cup. 
If one was drinking from a cup whose outer side was unclean he need not be concerned lest the liquid in his mouth contracted uncleanness from the outer side of the cup and that it then conveyed uncleanness to the cup. 
If a kettle was boiling one need not be concerned lest liquid should come out from it and touch its outer side and return again within it. 

Holy vessels do not have outer and inner sides or a part by which they are held.
One may not immerse vessels within one another for sacred use.      
All vessels become susceptible to uncleanness by intention, but they cannot be rendered insusceptible except by a change-effecting act, for an act annuls an earlier act as well as an earlier intention, but an intention annuls neither an earlier act nor an earlier intention. 


Chapter 26

An Imki sandal and a laced-up bag, 
Rabbi Judah says: also an Egyptian basket;   
Rabbi Shimon ben Gamaliel says: also a Lattakian sandal 
can be made susceptible to uncleanness  and again be made insusceptible  without the aid of a craftsman. 
Rabbi Yose said: But can't all vessels be made susceptible to uncleanness  and again insusceptible  without the aid of a craftsman?   
Rather, these, even when they are unlaced are susceptible to uncleanness since a layman can restore them.  
They spoke only of an Egyptian  basket  which even a craftsman cannot [easily]  restore.

A laced-up bag whose laces were removed is still susceptible to uncleanness; 
But if it was made flat it is pure. 
If he hung on it a strip of cloth below, it is susceptible. 
A bag within another bag and one of them became unclean from a liquid, the other does not become unclean.     
A pearl pouch is susceptible to uncleanness. 
A money pouch: 
Rabbi Eliezer says that it is susceptible to uncleanness, 
But the sages say that it is pure.

The hand-coverings of thorn-pickers are pure.     
A belt and leg guards are susceptible to uncleanness. 
Sleeves are susceptible to uncleanness. 
But hand-coverings are pure. 
All finger-coverings are pure except that of fig-pickers, since they hold the sumac berry.     
If it was torn, if it cannot hold the greater part of a sumac berry it is pure. 

A sandal, one of whose holes was broken and then he fixed it, retains its midras uncleanness.     
If a second hole was broken and he fixed it, it is free from midras uncleanness but is unclean from contact with midras.     
If he couldn't fix the first before the second hole was broken, it is clean.   
If its heel was torn off, or if its toe-piece was removed, or if it was torn in two, it becomes clean.     
A heel-less slipper that was torn anywhere becomes clean. 
A shoe that was damaged, if it cannot contain the greater part of the foot, it becomes clean. 
A shoe that is still on the last: 
Rabbi Eliezer says: it is insusceptible to uncleanness,     
But the sages say that it is susceptible. 
All water skins whose holes are tied up are insusceptible to uncleanness, except for Arabian ones.     
Rabbi Meir says: if they are tied up for a while, they are clean; but if they are tied permanently they are unclean. 
Rabbi Yose says: all tied up water skins are clean. 

The following hides are susceptible to midras uncleanness: 
A hide which he intended to use as a rug,     
A hide used as an apron, 
A hide used as the lower covering of a bed, 
A hide used by a donkey-driver, 
A hide used by a flax-worker, 
A hide used by a porter, 
A hide used by a doctor, 
A hide used for a crib, 
A hide put over a child's chest,     
A hide for a cushion. 
A hide for a covering. 
All these are susceptible to midras uncleanness. 
A hide for wrapping up combed wool and a hide worn by a wool-comber:
Rabbi Eliezer says it is susceptible to midras, 
But the sages say to corpse uncleanness.

A bag or wrapper for garments is susceptible to midras.  
A bag or wrapper for purple wool: 
Bet Shammai says: it is susceptible to midras, 
But Bet Hillel says: it is susceptible only to corpse uncleanness.     
A hide which he made to be a covering for vessels is not susceptible to uncleanness. For weights it is susceptible. 
Rabbi Yose declares clean in the name of his father. 

Whenever no act is lacking, intention alone causes a vessel to be susceptible to uncleanness, 
But whenever an act is lacking, intention alone does not render it susceptible to uncleanness, except for a fur cover.
The hides of a householder become susceptible to uncleanness by intention, but those that belong to a tanner do not become susceptible by mere intention. 
Those taken by a thief become susceptible by intention, but those taken by a robber  do not become susceptible by mere intention.     
Rabbi Shimon says: the rule is to be reversed; those taken by a robber become susceptible by mere intention, but those taken by a thief  do not become susceptible by  intention, since in the latter case the owner does not abandon hope for recovery.

If a hide had contracted midras uncleanness and its owner then intended it to be used for straps or sandals, it becomes clean as soon as he put the knife to it, the words of Rabbi Judah. 
But the sages say: it does not become clean until he has reduced its size to less than five handbreadths. 
Rabbi Elazar bar Zadok says: even if he made a napkin from a hide it remains unclean,
From a covering it becomes clean.


Chapter 27

Cloth is susceptible to five categories of uncleanness; 
Sack-cloth is susceptible to four; 
Leather, to three
Wood to two; 
And an earthenware vessel to one. 
An earthenware vessel is susceptible to uncleanness [only] as a receptacle; any earthenware vessel that has no inner part is not susceptible to uncleanness from its outer part.   
Wood is susceptible to an additional form of uncleanness in that it is also susceptible to uncleanness   as a seat.   
Similarly a tablet which has no rim is susceptible to uncleanness if it is a wooden object and insusceptible if it is an earthenware one. 
Leather is susceptible to an additional form of uncleanness in that it is also susceptible to the uncleanness of a tent.      
Sack-cloth has an additional form of uncleanness in that it is susceptible to uncleanness as woven work.     
Cloth has an additional form of uncleanness in that it is susceptible to uncleanness when it is only three by three fingerbreadths.

Cloth is susceptible to midras uncleanness when it is three handbreadths by three handbreadths, and to corpse uncleanness when it is three fingerbreadths by three fingerbreadths.     
Sack-cloth when it is four handbreadths by four handbreadths.
Leather, five handbreadths by five handbreadths. 
And matting, six handbreadths by six handbreadths. 
[All of these] are equally susceptible to both midras and corpse uncleanness. 
Rabbi Meir says: what remains of sack-cloth is susceptible to uncleanness if it is four handbreadths, but when in its first condition [it becomes susceptible only after it is]  completed. 

One who makes a piece of material from two handbreadths  of cloth and one of sack-cloth, or three of sack-cloth and one of leather or four of leather and one of matting, it is not susceptible to  uncleanness.     
Five handbreadths of matting and one of leather or four of leather and one of sack-cloth, or three of sack-cloth and one of cloth it is susceptible to uncleanness. 
This is the general rule: if he added material subject to greater restrictions it is susceptible to uncleanness, but if  material subject to lesser restrictions it is not susceptible.

One who cuts off from any of these a piece one by one handbreadth it is susceptible to uncleanness.     
From the bottom of a basket it is susceptible to uncleanness.     
From the sides of the basket: 
Rabbi Shimon says that it is not susceptible to uncleanness, 
But the sages say one who cuts off a square handbreadth from anywhere, it is susceptible to uncleanness. 

Worn-out pieces of a sifter or a sieve that he adapted for use as a seat: 
Rabbi Akiva rules that they are susceptible to uncleanness, 
But the sages rule that they are not susceptible until he cuts off their rough ends.   
A child's stool that has legs, even though it is less than a handbreadth high, is susceptible to uncleanness.     
A child's shirt: 
Rabbi Eliezer rules it is susceptible to uncleanness at any size.
But the sages rule: it is susceptible only if it is of the prescribed size, and it is measured when doubled over.

The following are measured when doubled:
Felt socks, long stockings, pants, a cap and a money-belt. 
A patch that he sewed on the hem, if it was simple it is measured simple, but if it was doubled it is measured doubled.      

A piece of cloth which was woven to the size of three by three handbreadths, and then it contracted midras uncleanness, and then he completed the rest of the piece, and then one removed a single thread from the original part, it  is free from midras uncleanness but is still unclean from contact with midras uncleanness. 
If he removed a thread from the original part and then he finished the whole cloth, it is still unclean from contact with midras uncleanness.

Similarly, a piece of cloth which he wove to the size of three [fingerbreadths] square, and it contracted corpse uncleanness, and afterwards he finished the entire piece, and then he removed a single thread from its original part, it is free from corpse uncleanness but is still unclean from contact with corpse uncleanness. 
If he removed a thread from the original part and then he finished all the cloth it remains clean, for the sages have ruled: if a piece of three [fingerbreadths] square is lessened it becomes clean.
But if one of three handbreadths square is lessened, even though it is released from midras, it is still susceptible to all other forms of uncleanness.  

A sheet that had contracted midras uncleanness and he made it into a curtain, it is pure from midras uncleanness but is still unclean from contact with midras uncleanness. 
Rabbi Yose said: but what midras uncleanness has this touched! 
Only if a zav had  touched it  is it unclean from contact with a zav.

A piece of cloth three [handbreadths] square that was divided,  it is pure from midras uncleanness but is still unclean from contact with midras uncleanness. 
Rabbi Yose said: but what midras uncleanness has this touched! 
Only if a zav had  touched it  is it unclean from contact with a zav.

[If a piece of cloth] three [handbreadths] square [was found] in a trash heap it must  be both sound and capable of wrapping up salt;     
But [if it was found] in the house it need only be either sound or capable of wrapping up salt. 
How much salt must it be capable of wrapping up? A quarter of a kav.
Rabbi Judah says: this refers to fine salt, 
But the sages stated: it refers to coarse salt. 
Both intended to be lenient.     
Rabbi Shimon says: [the law concerning a piece of cloth] three [handbreadths] square found in a rubbish heap is the same as that for a piece of cloth that was three [fingerbreadths] square in a house.

[A piece of cloth] three [handbreadths] square that was torn: if he put it on a chair, and his skin touches the chair, it is pure; 
And if not, it remains pure. 
[A piece of cloth] three [fingerbreadths] square one thread of which was worn away, or in which a knot was found, or in which two threads ran alongside each other, is pure. 
[A piece of cloth] three [fingerbreadths] square that was thrown on the rubbish heap becomes pure. 
If he brought it back, it it becomes susceptible to uncleanness. 
Throwing it away always renders it pure and taking it back renders it susceptible to uncleanness, except when it is of purple or fine crimson.     
Rabbi Eliezer says: a patch of new cloth is also subject to the same law. 
Rabbi Shimon says: all these become pure; they were mentioned only in connection with the return of lost property.


Chapter 28

[A piece of cloth] three [fingerbreadths] square that was stuffed into a ball or was itself made into a ball is clean.   
But [a piece of cloth] three [handbreadths] square that was stuffed into a  ball remains unclean.   
If he made it into a ball itself, it is clean because the sewing reduces its size. 

[A piece of cloth] less than three [handbreadths] square that he adapted for the purpose of stopping up a hole in a bath house, of emptying a cooking-pot  or of wiping with it the mill stones, whether it was or was not kept ready for any such use, is susceptible to uncleanness, the words of Rabbi Eliezer. 
Rabbi Joshua says: whether it was or was not kept ready it is pure.
Rabbi Akiva says: if  it was kept ready it is susceptible, and if it was not kept ready it is pure.  

One who makes a bandage either of cloth or of leather it is pure.
(Rabbi Yose says: with leather it is pure.) 
A poultice is pure if it is on cloth, but if on leather it is susceptible.     
Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: even if it was on cloth it remains susceptible to uncleanness because it can be shaken off.

Covers of scrolls, whether they are decorated or not, are susceptible to uncleanness according to the words of Bet Shammai. 
Bet Hillel says: those that are decorated are pure, but those that are not decorated are susceptible. 
Rabban Gamaliel says: both the former and the latter are pure.  

A head-wrap that had contracted midras uncleanness and he wrapped it around a scroll, it is clean from midras uncleanness but it remains susceptible to corpse uncleanness. 
A skin that he made into a rug or a rug that he made into a skin becomes clean.     
A skin that he made into a [shepherd's] wallet or a [shepherd's] wallet that he made into a skin; 
Or a cushion cover that he made into a sheet or a sheet that he made into a cushion cover;  
Or a sheet cover that he made into a plain sheet or a plain sheet that he made into a sheet cover, remains unclean. 
This is the general rule: any object that has been changed into one of with the same name remains unclean, but if into one of with another name, it becomes clean. 

A patch which he sewed on to a basket, it conveys one grade of uncleanness and one of unfitness.     
If he separated it from the basket, it conveys one grade of uncleanness and one of unfitness, but the patch becomes clean.     
If he sewed it on to cloth it conveys two grades of uncleanness and one of unfitness.     
If he separated it from the cloth, it conveys one grade of uncleanness and one of unfitness, while the patch conveys two grades of uncleanness and one of unfitness.     
Similarly one who sews a patch on to sacking or leather, the words of Rabbi Meir. 
Rabbi Shimon says that it is clean.     
Rabbi Yose says: if on leather it becomes clean; but if on sacking it remains unclean, since the latter is a woven material.

The three (fingerbreadths) square of which they spoke do not include the hem, the words of Rabbi Shimon. 
But the sages say: exactly three [fingerbreadths] square.     
If he sewed a patch on to a cloth by one side only, it is not considered as connected.     
If he sewed it on two opposite sides, it is considered connected.      
If he sewed it on in the shape of a gamma:
Rabbi Akiva says that the cloth is unclean, 
But the sages say that it is clean. 
Rabbi Judah said: When does this apply? To a cloak, but in the case of an undershirt the patch is regarded as connected if he sewed it by its upper side, but if by its lower side it is not connected.      

Poor men's clothes, even though they are made up of pieces none of which is three [fingerbreadths] square are susceptible to midras uncleanness.
If a cloak began to be torn, as soon as its greater part is torn [the pieces] are not regarded as connected.     
Thick or thin materials are not governed by the prescribed minimum of three [fingerbreadths] square.

A porter's pad is susceptible to midras uncleanness. 
A wine filter is not susceptible to uncleanness as a seat.     
An old woman's hair-net is susceptible to uncleanness as a seat.     
A prostitute's shirt which is woven like a net is not susceptible to uncleanness.     
One who makes a garment out of fishing net, it is not susceptible to uncleanness, but one made of its bag is susceptible. 
Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob says: even one who makes a garment out of a fishing net and doubles it, it is susceptible to uncleanness.

A hair-net that one began to make from its upper hem remains pure until he finishes its bottom section.
If one began from its bottom section, it remains pure until he finishes its hem. 
Its head band is susceptible to uncleanness in itself.     
Its strings are susceptible to uncleanness because they are connected.     
A hair-net that is torn, if it cannot contain the greater part of the hair, it is pure. 


Chapter 29

The fringe strings of a sheet, a scarf, a head-wrap and a felt cap [are regarded as connected]  up to a length of six fingerbreadths;    
Those of an undergarment up to ten [fingerbreadths]. 
The fringes of a thick wool cloak, a veil, a shirt, or a light cloak [are regarded as connected] up to a length of three fingerbreadths. 
The fringes of an old woman's head-wrap, of Arabian face wraps, of Cilician goat's-hair clothing, of a money-belt, of a turban or of a curtain are  regarded as connected whatever their length may be. 

Three woolen pillow-covers, six linen ones, three sheets,  twelve handkerchiefs, two pant-sleeves, one shirt, one cloak, or one winter-cloak,  can be regarded as connected in respect of both uncleanness  and sprinkling.   
More than this number they are regarded as connected in respect of uncleanness but not in respect of sprinkling.   
Rabbi Yose says: not even in respect of uncleanness.

The string of a [common] plumb-line is regarded as connected up to a length of twelve [cubits];     
That of the carpenters’ plumb-line, up to eighteen [cubits];     
And that of the builders’ plumb-line up to fifty cubits. 
The parts that exceed these lengths, even if it was desired to retain them, are pure.     
The plumb-line of plasterers or moldders is regarded as connected whatsoever its length.

The cord of the balances of goldsmiths or those who weigh fine purple cloth is regarded as connected up to a length of three fingerbreadths,
