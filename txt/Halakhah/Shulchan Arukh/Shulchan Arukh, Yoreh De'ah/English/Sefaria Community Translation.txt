Siman 1

All may slaughter, at the outset, even women.




...The one who is deaf and speaks but cannot hear: He does not perform the slaughter since he does not hear the blessing. If he performs the slaughter, even if it just for himself, the slaughter is valid.
...One who hears but does not speak: if he is an expert, he performs the slaughter even from the outset if another says the blessing.
...A drunk who has reached the drunkenness of Lot--his status is like one who is crazy. If he has not reached the drunkenness of Lot--he may perform the slaughter from the outset. Rem'a: There are those who say that a drunk does not perform the slaughter  because he often comes to chopping (instead of cutting).
...One who is blind: He does not perform the slaughter from the outset unless others are watching him. If he performs the slaughter, his slaughter is valid.
...One who is naked: He does not perform the slaughter from the outset because he cannot say the blessing.
...If a community vowed that only a certain butcher would perform the slaughter, and another goes and performs the slaughter: there those who say that his slaughter is forbidden. Rem'a: If they abolished the decree--all butchers are assumed to be valid as before.

ritual slaughter of [a kosher animal done by] a worshipper of stars [meaning non-jew; the animal slaughtered has the status of a] Nevilah, even [if the ritual slaughtering was done by a non-jewish] minor and even if its not a non-jew (for example a ger toshav) even if others [who are jews] supervise him

1. The punctured lung is treif
2. The lung has five (<i>ear-shaped</i>) minor lobes, three on the right and two on the left side, as the animal is suspended by its feet and its guts face the slaughterer, such that the slaughterer's and the animal's right sides are one.  On the right side there is another small lobe called the "small roseate lobe", not in line with the minor lobes, rather it projects from the front.  If one is missing from the right or the left, or if there were two on the right and three on the left, the lung is terefah. <i>HGH"H: The shapes of the right minor lobes are unlike those of the left ones.  If they are reversed in shape - terefah.  Similarly if the right middle minor lobe is larger than the lower minor lobe - terefah. If the upper left minor lobe is larger than the upper right minor lobe - terefah.  Similarly, if the major right lobe is larger than the left - all this is called 'reversed' and is terefah.  The roseate small lobe - if it's absent, or if it's on the left side - kosher. HGH: In these lands we regard zero or two small roseate lobes, or a roseate lobe on the wrong side, terefah, and it is proper to do so, and many of our rabbis agree, and custom should not be changed. Similarly, if its appearance or shape differs from the norm - terefah.  If there are two roseate lobes with a common finger-thick base: even though it has a crack, it's kosher.  And if one is upside down and the other normal, we follow the larger, if that is right side up, it's kosher.  The roseate lobe is normally in a pocket.  </i>

A limb from a live animal is forbidden from a domesticated animal, a wild animal, or fowl.
A limb that separates from a live animal is forbidden. And flesh that separates from a live animal is forbidden because of "And the flesh in the field Treifah." And even what separates from the animal [but] is still inside it - such as [where it was] cut from the spleen or from the kidneys and the piece was left inside it - it is forbidden.



Siman 63

Meat that was found spread out in the market, one goes after the majority, because a part goes after the majority of parts. If the majority of the sellers [of meat] are non-Jews, it is forbidden. And if the majority of the sellers are Jews, it is permitted. And this is the case with meat that was found in the hand of a non-Jew and it is not known from whom he purchased it. If the meat sellers are Jews, it is permitted. This is the law [according to] Torah. And the Sages already forbade all meat that is found, either at the market or in the hand of a non-Jew, even though all the sellers and all of the slaughterers are Jews. And furthermore, the one who buys meat and places it in his house and it disappears, it is forbidden [to eat it]. Rather, if there is a sign or there were recognizable rings [on the meat], and he definitely recognizes it that it is the [same meat] or it was bound and stamped, [then the meat is permitted].

Meat needs to be washed before it is salted. (if the butcher washed it, there is no need to was it in the house, tur). If, after washing, the piece was cut into two or three (or the hooves were removed after washing, aruch), returning and rewashing is necessary. 
If it was salted but not washed first, rinse it and salt it again. There are some who forbid this practice. Rema: This is our custom, even if it was only salted a little bit, like the amount of salt used before it is roasted, and even if it was not salted for a shiur melicha (aruch, sharei durah, and semag). One who is in danger of a great loss can be lenient (beit yosef), and if it was just rinsed a little before salting it is acceptable after the fact. This is the rule if the piece of meat is 60 times the volume of the blood that is on it (Sharei Durah in the name of the Mahari). If one salted an unwashed piece of meat with other pieces of meat, the other pieces are acceptable and the unwashed one is forbidden (aruch).
Don't use salt that is as fine as flour, and don't use salt that is too thick because it will fall off the meat. Rema: and if one only has salt that is as fine as flour, it is acceptable to use it.
One should scatter salt so that no place remains without salt. And, one should salt so that it [i.e. the meat] won't be fitting for eating with the same amount of salt. There is no need to add more salt than this. It should be salted on both sides. Birds need to be salted also on the inside. If they are only salted on the inside or on the outside, and likewise with pieces [of meat] that are only salted on one side, these are permitted. Gloss: And there are those who forbid this even after the fact, and this is the custom if there is no great need for the meat [i.e. to feed guests, or shabbat is starting soon. This means that it is permissible to use meat salted on one side even from the outset if there is a need for it.]. But if the meat hasn't been cooked, one should not cook it as is, but if it's within 12 hours of having been salted should instead salt the second side that hasn't been salted and then cook it afterwards. If it has been after 12 hours of being salted then one should roast it on the fire, and the fire certainly draws it [i.e. the blood] out, and the side that was salted won't absorb [blood] from the side that wasn't salted.
After you salted the piece of meat, if you cut that piece, there is no need to return and salt the place where the meat has been cut.
The length of salting the meat is not less than the length it takes [in time] to walk a mile, and this is approximately a third of an hour. Gloss: And this is authoritative after the fact, or even from the outset [if the meat is needed in order to] to honor guests or for the needs of Shabbat. But, without this [need] the custom is to wait with the meat being salted for the length of an hour, and this cannot be changed.
Before one places the meat in the vessel that it will be washed in, one should shake off the salt that's on it or wash it in water and afterwards place the meat in the vessel that it's being washed in and wash it several times. The vessel should be washed between each and every rinsing [of the meat]. Gloss: And there are those who say that the meat needs to be washed three times and this is the custom from the outset, therefore if one washes or shakes off the salt from among it and washes it twice, this is like washing it three times. Or one places the water in the vessel and afterwards places the meat in it and washes it three times. And this is the custom from the outset, that one gives lots of water in the first rinsing in order to nullify the strength of the salt that's in the brine. It's permitted to wash the meat in fruit juice, and water is not required. 
If one did not shake off the salt that is on [the meat] and did not rinse it [off], the [meat] is not forbidden because the water in the vessel will negate the strength of the salt. Rema: Even a small amount of water will negate the strength of the tzir. (Aruch, klal 6 and Mahari). There are those who permit [the meat] even if there was no water in the vessel when the meat was placed there since we aren't concerned about the short amount of time while the person is washing the meat. (Share Durah). We can rely on this. We only worry about all this for the first washing, but after the first washing there is no concern. (Such are the words of the Mordechai and the Ran). And there is no difference between washing in a vessel that is kosher, non-kosher, or dairy. As long as there is a little water in the vessel to negate the strength of the salt so that it is not cooking, even if the vessel is dairy or non-kosher, or dirty with forbidden things. (Aruch).

Siman 71

Cut the head in two and salt it well on the inside and salt on the hair since the hair does not stop the salt from drawing out blood.
Cut the hooves a little on the bottom and salt it. The place of the cut should be placed face down, and also salt on the hair (see siman 68).
The membrane that is on the brain has veins in it and the brain itself has blood. The blood cannot escape the brain when the head is salted due to the skull getting in the way and preventing the blood from flowing out. Therefore, one who wishes to salt it must split the skull, remove the brain, tear the membrane, and salt it. One who wishes to salt the head with the brain inside it, one must make a hole in the skull and the membrane, and salt it with the hole facing downwards. It will be acceptable even for a cooking pot.

(Non-hot) Meat and cheese that touched each other are both permissible to be eaten, providing that you first rinse off the spot on each where they touched.  It is permissible to wrap them both in one napkin (or wrap), and not be worried lest they touch.



Siman 92

An olive-worth of meat that falls into a pot of boiling milk: let a non-Jew taste the dish. If he says that there is a taste of meat in it, it is forbidden. If not, it [the milk] is permitted, even in less than sixty, and that piece [the meat] is forbidden.  When is this true?  When one quickly removes the piece before it exudes the milk that it absorbed, meaning before the pot rests from its boiling.  But if he didn't remove it before it was able to exude the milk it absorbed, even if a non Jew tastes it and it has no taste at all, it's forbidden unless there is sixty.  <i>See chapter 98 (Shulchan Arukh, Yoreh De'ah 98) that we aren't accustomed to rely on the tasting of a non-Jew and we need sixty every time.</i> 
Milk falls into a pot of meat: [let a non-Jew] taste the piece that the milk fell on.  If it does not taste of milk, everything is permitted.  If the piece does taste of milk, then that piece is forbidden. <i>For us who don't rely on a non-Jew, we need sixty in the piece, and if there's not sixty then it's all forbidden.</i> And we measure it [the original piece of meat] against the whole [pot].  If there was in all that is in the pot, the pieces, the vegetables, the soup, and the spices, enough that this piece is one in sixty [or less] of the whole, the piece is forbidden and the rest is permitted.  In what situation are we speaking? When the pot was not stirred at the beginning when the milk  fell in, but only at the end, and the pot wasn't covered.  But if it was stirred from beginning until end or was covered from the time of [milk] falling in until the end, everything joins together to nullify the taste of milk. <i>Therefore, if it wasn't stirred at all, not at the beginning and not at the end, and wasn't covered at all, if there is sixty in the pot compared to the drop of milk that fell in, it only prohibits the piece alone, and the rest of the pot is permitted (Bet Yosef in the name of the Ra'avid and Magid Mishnah in the name of the Rambam.) And also if it was stirred at the beginning or covered immediately even though it wasn't stirred or covered at the end, all of the pot joins together, if it was stirred or covered immediately when the prohibited matter fell in (Tur and Bet Yosef in the name of the Ri N Haviv.)</i>  Therefore, if [the milk] fell into the soup or onto a piece and we don't know onto which piece it fell, stir the whole pot until it's all mixed.  If in the whole pot there is a taste of milk, it's prohibited, and if not, it's permitted.  And if there is no non-Jew to taste and be relied on, we measure with sixty (until now, the language of the Rambam.)  <i>There are those who disagree and reason that stirring the pot isn't effective unless it's stirred immediately after the prohibited matter fell in, and this is our practice.</i>

It is forbidden to eat new (crop) of the five types of grain until the Omer is brought, which is the 16th of Nissan. As it says, “And bread, toasted grain, and unripe (or damp) grain you may not eat until (the end of) this very day.” And in these times that there is no Omer, it is forbidden (on) all of the 16th day. And outside of Israel where we observe two days, it is forbidden (on) all of the 17th day, until the beginning of the night of the 18th.
The prohibition of (eating) new (grain) is practiced both in Israel and outside Israel, whether of a Jew’s (grain) or a non-Jew’s.
Grain that did not take root before the 16th of Nissan is forbidden until the next Omer comes. Rama: And nevertheless, all indeterminate grain is permitted after Passover because of a double doubt. Perhaps it comes from the previous year. And even if you’ll say that it came from this year, nevertheless, perhaps it took root before the Omer (Tur quoting the Rosh).  And in types of grain that they certainly plant after Pesach, for example in some countries where they plant spelt and barley after Passover, then he should be stringent after the harvest, unless the gates of the country are not closed and most of the grain comes from another place where they plant before Passover. (Hg”M Ch. 11 from the M”A &amp; Tos. End of Ch. 1 of Kiddushin) And also, in a time when the winter season extends to after Passover, and in all of that region they plant the abovementioned crops after Passover, one should be stringent and suspect unless known otherwise. But one should not teach others in a place where most of their drinking and eating is from these species, because it is better that they be negligent and not to be pre-meditated. (So it seems in the Tur quoting the Rosh and T”H Ch. 158)

In this era, even in a place where Jews ascending from the Diaspora have acquired a presumption of ownership, and even in the days of Ezra (the Scribe), there is no pentateuchal obligation of priestly gifts and tithes; rather, a rabbinic obligation exists, since the verse says, "When you shall come...," implying when all of you will ascend to the land, and not a partial Aliyah, as there was in the days of Ezra.  <i>Gloss: And there are dissenters, and their position is that [even] nowadays we are biblically obligated <u>in the land of Israel</u> in priestly gifts and tithes, yet we do not follow this custom (Yaakov ben Asher (Ba'al ha-Turim) quoting Rabeinu Yitzchak).</i>
