Chapter 1

It is a positive commandment for one who desires to partake of the meat of a domesticated animal, wild beast, or fowl to slaughter (it) and then partake of it  as (Deuteronomy 12:21) states: “And you shall slaughter from your cattle and from your sheep.” And with regard to a firstborn animal with a blemish (ibid: 22) states: “As one would partake of a deer and a gazelle.” From this we learn that a wild beast is (governed by) the same (laws) as a domesticated animal with regard to ritual slaughter. And with regard to a fowl (Leviticus 17:13) states: “that will snare a beast or a fowl as prey…and shed its blood.” This teaches that shedding the blood of a fowl is analogous to shedding the blood of a wild beast.
