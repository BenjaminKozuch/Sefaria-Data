Chapter 1

Before the giving of the Torah, it would be that if a man happened upon a woman in the marketplace and they wanted to marry each other, he would bring her into his house and consummate the marriage between them privately, and she would be his wife. Once the Torah was given, Israel was commanded that if a man wanted to marry a woman, he would acquire her first through witnesses, and afterwards she would be his wife, as it says, "When a man takes a woman and sleeps with her..." (Deuteronomy 22:13).

Chapter 2



Chapter 3

How is a woman sanctified (for engagement)? If one choses to do so with money (or its equivalent), it can not have less than the value of a "Pruta". He says to her, "behold, you are sanctified to me", "behold, you are engaged to me", "behold, with this, you are to be my wife", and he gives her the object in front of witnesses. The man must be the one to say words that have the meaning of an acquisition, and it must be he that is giving her the money. 
If she gives the money and says, "I am sanctified to you", "I am engaged to you", "I am a wife to you" or any other acquisition term, she is not sanctified. So to if she gives the money and he speaks, she is not sanctified.If he gives and she speaks, this is a questionable sanctification.
...If he sanctified with a document, he writes it on  paper or clay or of earth, or on anything he desires. "Behold, you are sanctified to me", "behold, you are engaged to me" and so on (other terms), and gives her the document in front of witnesses.
