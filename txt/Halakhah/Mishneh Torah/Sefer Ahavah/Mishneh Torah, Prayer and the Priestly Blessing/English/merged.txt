Chapter 1

It is a positive commandment to pray every day, as it is written: "You shall worship the Lord your God" (Ex. 23:25).  By tradition, they learned that this worship is prayer, as it says: "and to worship God with all of your heart" (Deut. 11:13)—the sages said what is worship of the heart? This is prayer.  The number of prayers is not biblical, the form of prayer is not biblical, and prayer has no biblically fixed time.
Therefore, women and slaves are obligated in prayer because it is a positive commandment lacking a fixed time, but the obligation of this commandment is as follows: a person should supplicate and pray every day and relate the praise of God, and afterwards ask for their needs as a request and a supplication, and afterwards give praise and thanks to God for the good that has been bestowed upon them, each person according to their ability.
