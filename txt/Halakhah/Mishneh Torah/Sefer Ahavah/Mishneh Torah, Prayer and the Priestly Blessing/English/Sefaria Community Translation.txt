Chapter 1

It is a positive commandment to pray every day, as it is written: "You shall worship the Lord your God" (Ex. 23:25).  By tradition, they learned that this worship is prayer, as it says: "and to worship God with all of your heart" (Deut. 11:13)—the sages said what is worship of the heart? This is prayer.  The number of prayers is not biblical, the form of prayer is not biblical, and prayer has no biblically fixed time.
Therefore, women and slaves are obligated in prayer because it is a positive commandment lacking a fixed time, but the obligation of this commandment is as follows: a person should supplicate and pray every day and relate the praise of God, and afterwards ask for their needs as a request and a supplication, and afterwards give praise and thanks to God for the good that has been bestowed upon them, each person according to their ability.
If one is accustomed/fluent, he increases in supplications and petitions, and if one has uncircumcised lips, he speaks according to his ability and anytime he likes. And so, the number of prayers is as each to their own abilities. There are some who pray once a day, and there are those who pray many times. And everyone would pray facing the Temple. And this was the way of things from the time of Moses to Ezra. 
When Israel was dispersed in the days of Nebudchadnezzar the evil, they were in foreign lands and they had children in the foreign lands and their children spoke babble. And everyone’s language was this one and this one and languages were very mixed. And since the speaker was not able to speak all, they needed one language, rather that they should be confused. As it is said: “And half their children spoke in the language of Ashdod, etc” [Nehemiah 13:24]. And none knew how to speak “Yehudit” and spoke the language of the people. And because of this, when one prayed, his tongue was shortened to ask for his needs, or to give praise to the HKBH in the holy language until that their tongues were mixed up. And when Ezra and his Beit Din saw this was, they rose and instituted for themselves the 18 blessings in the order of three first praises to HaShem, and three last thanksgivings, and the middle there were in them requests on all the things that are like the foundations of every person’s desires/needs, man to man. And the needs of the community should be set in the mouths of all and they will learn them. And there will be a prayer, even the stutterers will pray wholly like the prayers of the smooth talkers, because this matter was set, all the blessings and prayers were ordered in the mouths of all Israel so that the whole matter was set in the mouths of the stutterer.

Bowing, how is it done? The one who is praying bows five bows in each and every prayer. In the first blessing at the beginning and at the end. And in “giving thanks” at the beginning and the end. And when he finishes the prayer, he bows and then takes three steps behind him to take his leave and he says goodbye. He turns his body to the left, and afterward he turns his body to the right, and afterward he raises his head from the bow. And when he bows "4 bows" he bows during the Barukh. And he  rises up during the recitation of the Name.  And to whom does all this apply? A layman. But a High Priest, bows at the beginning and at the end of all the blessings. And a king?  Once he bows at the begining, he does not raise his head until the end of his prayer.
And why do we start saying goodbye toward the left? Because his left side is the right side of Him whom stands before/in front of him. Namely, when he stands before The King, Giving Peace to the right of the King, and afterward to the left of The King. And it was determined that when he leaves from his praying, like leaving the presence of The King..
And all of the bows, these are done by bowing until your vertebrae separate until it is like a [rain]bow [or a bow as in “bow and arrow”].
Prostrating, how is it done? After he raises his head from bowing the fifth bow, he sits on the ground and falls upon his face to the ground for Tachanun and the entire Tachanun that he wants [to say]. The Bowing referred to everywhere is upon the knees, The Qeda bow is upon the nose.  Prostration is done with the hands and legs/feet stretched out until you find yourself placed upon the ground.
When you fall upon your face after prayer, some perform the Qeda bow. And some perform the prostration bow. It is forbidden to prostrate upon hewn stones outside of the Temple, as I have explained this in Laws of the Worship of the Stars.  And an important man should not fall his face upon the ground unless he is sure that he is as holy as Yehoshu'a. But instead he should lower his face but not place it on the ground. It is permitted for a person to pray in one location and to fall upon his face in another location.
