Chapter 1



Chapter 2

One who reads the Shma and did not intend one's heart in the first verse, which is "Hear O Israel," did not fulfill her obligation. And the rest [of the Shma], if one didn't intend one's heart, one did fulfill [one's obligation], even if one was reading in the Torah according to one's practice or proofing these sections in the time (season?) of reading, one fulfilled [one's obligation], and that is just if one intended one's heart in the first verse.
