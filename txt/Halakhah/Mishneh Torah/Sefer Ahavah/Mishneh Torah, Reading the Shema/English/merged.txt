Chapter 1

The Shema is recited twice every day, once in the evening and once in the morning, as it is said: Recite them when you stay at home and when you are away, when you lie down and when you get up (Deut. 6: 7). The time when people customarily lie down is evening and the time when people customarily get up is morning.
What does one recite? The three paragraphs beginning with the words Hear (Deut. 6:4-9); If, then, you obey (Deut. II: 13-21); and The Lord said (Num. 15:37-41). The paragraph Hear is recited first because it contains commandments concerning God's unity, the love of God, and the study of God, which is the basic principle on which all depends? After it, If, then, you obey, is recited since the passage commands obedience to all the other commandments. After that, the paragraph concerning the fringes is recited, since it also contains a command to recall all the commandments.


Chapter 2

One who reads the Shma and did not intend one's heart in the first verse, which is "Hear O Israel," did not fulfill her obligation. And the rest [of the Shma], if one didn't intend one's heart, one did fulfill [one's obligation], even if one was reading in the Torah according to one's practice or proofing these sections in the time (season?) of reading, one fulfilled [one's obligation], and that is just if one intended one's heart in the first verse.
