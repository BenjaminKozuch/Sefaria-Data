Chapter 1

A Hebrew servant that is spoken of in the Torah, is a Jew that court of law sold against his will or sold himself of his own will. How so? ...


[If someone] comes and says to you, "Indeed I am selling myself to a gentile," you do not need to [help] him until he is sold. But after he is sold to the gentile, even though he transgressed and performed [something] that is not proper, it is a commandment to redeem him, and not [have him] become assimilated with them [i.e. the gentiles], as it is stated, "after that he is sold he may be redeemed" (Leviticus 25:48).
One who sells himself or the court of law forces him, he is not sold in public on a purchasing stone and not in an alley, as the way that slaves are sold, as it says, "they shall not be sold as bondmen" (Leviticus 25:42). Instead [he should be sold] privately and a manner of honor.




[Someone becomes neither] a female Hebrew servant nor a [male] Hebrew servant except when the Jubilee occurs. This occurs whether a Hebrew servant sells himself or whether a court of law sells him. We have already explained when the Jubilee was canceled.
