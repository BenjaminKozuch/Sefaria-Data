Iggeret HaRamban
אגרת הרמב"ן
Sefaria Community Translation
http://www.sefaria.org"Listen, my son, to the thought of your father, and do not forsake the teaching of your mother." (Proverbs 1:8)
Accustom yourself to always speak all of your words peacefully, to every man and at every time. In doing so you will prevent your anger from flaring, which is a bad attribute in a man which may cause him to sin. And accordingly said our Rabbis, may their memories be a blessing: (Nedarim 22a) "Anyone who gets angry - all of Gehinnom holds sway over him, as it says: (Kohelet 11:10) 'And remove the anger from your heart, and take away the bad from your flesh', and 'bad' can only mean Gehinnom, as it says (Proverbs 16:4): 'And the sinner, he too, will have his day of bad'."
