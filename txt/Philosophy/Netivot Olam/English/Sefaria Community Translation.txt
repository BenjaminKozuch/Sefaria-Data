...And when it says they died from Passover until Shavuot, the explanation is that this time, between Passover and Shavuot, teaches us about Honoring the Torah.  Because the counting [of the Omer] is 49 days, until the giving of the Torah.  Because the Torah is elevated, up to the 50th gate. And therefore we have the counting of seven weeks, one level after another, until we get to the 50th gate.  And they did not give honor to the Torah, for they did not show honor to their fellows.  And because as the Torah is elevated, so the days of counting teach us that the Torah is elevated to the 50th gate.  That is why they died specifically during this time between Passover and Shavuot.
