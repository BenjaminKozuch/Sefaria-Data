Chapter 1

...CHAPTER 1 ***
The definition of the wholehearted acceptance of the unity of G-d is that the heart and the tongue are equal in acknowledging the unity of G-d, after understanding, in the way of logical proofs, the certainty of His existence and the truth of His unity. For acknowledgment of the unity of G-d among men differs according to their level of intelligence and understanding. 
Among them: One who declares the unity (of G-d) with only his tongue, namely, that he hears people say something and he is drawn after them without understanding the meaning of what he is saying.
Among them: One who declares the unity of G-d with his heart and tongue, who understands the matter of what he is saying through the kabala (tradition) that he received from his ancestors, but he does not understand the clarification of what he received of this matter, and the truth of what he believes in this matter.
Among them: One who declares His unity after understanding through logical proofs the truth of the matter, but he will conceive G-d's Unity like other unities to be found, and he will come to form a material conception of the Creator and represent Him with a form and likeness because he does not understand the true nature of His Unity and the matter of His existence.
Among them: One who declares G-d's unity with his heart and with his tongue after understanding the concept of true oneness and temporary oneness, and he can bring proofs to demonstrate G-d's existence and true oneness - this class of men is the complete (unblemished) group regarding the matter of unity of G-d.
Therefore, I defined the wholehearted acknowledgment of the unity (of G-d) - that it is the equalizing of the tongue and the heart in the unity of the Creator, after one knows how to bring proofs on it and understands the ways of His true Unity through intellectual investigation.

Chapter 2

CHAPTER 2 ***
The author says: Regarding how many ways the unity of G-d is conceived, I will answer as follows: Since the word "unity" spread among men of the unity (Jews), they became accustomed to using it frequently in their tongue and words, until it became an expression of amazement whether for good or for bad 
And they use it to express their dread of great calamity, and to exaggerate it and to express amazement on it, and they don't put to heart to understand the true matter of what passes through their tongue (when reciting the Shema), due to ignorance and laziness. And they consider the matter of Unity is done for them when they finish (reciting) its word, and they do not sense that their heart is void of His truth and that their mind is empty of its meaning because they declare His unity with their tongue and in words, and they will conceive Him in their hearts to be more than One and represent Him in their minds with the likeness of other "unities" to be found, and they will speak of His attributes in a way that cannot belong to the true Unity, because they don't understand the matter of true Unity versus temporary unity, except for a treasured few who plumbed the depths of wisdom and understood the matter of the Creator versus the created, and the characteristics of true Unity and what G-d is singular in.
The philosopher spoke truth when he said: "no one can serve the Cause of causes and Beginning of beginnings except the prophet of the generation with his senses or the primary philosopher with the wisdom he acquired, but others serve other than Him, since they cannot conceive what exists, but rather can only conceive that which is composite. 
Because of this the acceptance of the Unity falls into four divisions, corresponding to the different levels of recognition and understanding in men:
(1) Unity of G-d in the tongue only. This level is reached by the child and the simpleton who does not understand the matter of Judaism, and in whose heart its truth is not fixed.
(2) Unity of G-d in the mind and in the tongue through tradition, because he believes those who he received from, but he does not understand the truth of the matter through his own intellect and understanding. He is like the blind man who follows the seeing man, and it is possible that the one he follows received the tradition from a receiver like himself, whereby it would be like a chain of blind men where each one places his hands on the shoulders of his fellow until at the head is a seeing man who guides them all, and if the seeing man fails them or neglects them and is not careful to guard them, or if one of the blind men in the chain stumbles or some other trouble happens - all of them will share the same fate, and will stray from the path, and it is possible they will fall in a pit or ditch, or they will stumble in something which blocks their progress. 
Similarly for one who proclaims the unity out of tradition, one cannot be sure he will not come to association, that if he hears the words of the Meshanim and their claims, It is possible that he will change his outlook, and will err without noticing. Because of this our sages said: "Be eager to study the Torah and know what to respond to an apikoros (heretic)" (Pirkei Avos 2:14). (Translator: most people I've spoken to mistakenly believe the logical arguments for G-d's existence have been refuted. This stems from not understanding those arguments in enough depth, as we will see) 
(3) The third group: Unity of G-d with the mind and the tongue after one can bring logical proofs demonstrating the truth of His existence, but without understanding the matter of true oneness versus temporary oneness. This is like a seeing man who is traveling along the road, wishing to reach a faraway land, and the road splits to many uncertain roads, and he does not recognize the correct road which leads to the city he wishes to reach. Even though he knows the general direction. He will greatly tire himself and will fail to reach his destination, because he does not know the (correct) road, as the verse says: "the toil of the fool will tire him who knows not to reach a city" (Koheles 10:15). 
(4) The fourth group: Acknowledgement of the Unity of G-d with the mind and the tongue after one knows how to bring proofs on it, and to comprehend the truth of His oneness through intellectual derivation and correct, sound reasoning - this is the complete and important group, and this is the level which the prophet exhorted us in saying: "Know therefore this day, and set it in your heart, that the L-ord he is G-d" (Devarim 4:39).
