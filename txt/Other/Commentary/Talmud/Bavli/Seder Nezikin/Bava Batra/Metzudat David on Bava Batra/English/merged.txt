Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a



Line 1

It is explained in the Gemara it is made out of bricks. This is problematic to the Ri because in Habakkuk 2:11 it is written beams (Kfis) of timber shall answer. It implies that Kfisin is wooden!  The Ri says that you place wood on the top and bottom of the stone wall.
