Daf 1b



Daf 2a



Line 1

They own a courtyard in a partnership and both of their houses open into the courtyard. The sages say that a courtyard is located in front of the house and most of the work is done there.
One gives half of the thickness of the wall from his property and the other does the same.
All of this will be explained in the Gemara
If the custom of the land is to build with rough stones,  a man's friend cannot say to him, "I don't want that, I would prefer smooth stones."
That the thickness of a rough edged wall is 6 hand-breadths, a smooth edged wall is 5, half bricks is 4, and bricks are 3.
