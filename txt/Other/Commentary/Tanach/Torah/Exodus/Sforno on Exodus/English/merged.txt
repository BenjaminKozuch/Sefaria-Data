Verse 1



Verse 2

From here on, the months belong to you to do with them as you wish.  But during the days of slavery, your days were not your own but rather were for the work of others according to their will.   Therefore this [Nisan - the month of your freedom going out of Egypt] will be the first of the months of the year for you.
