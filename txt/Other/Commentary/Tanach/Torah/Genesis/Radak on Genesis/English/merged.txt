"Before the water..." - He went in before they came.  And we don't know the reason why he says in his interpretation that he was of little faith.  Because the text testifies that he was righteous and pure and that he did everything God commanded!

The reason why the Torah repeated the emotions Yaakov experienced twice but in different words was to underline how strongly he felt fear.
In Bereshit Rabbah 76,2 these two expressions are described as basically meaning the same thing, the only difference being that the former is intransitive, Yaakov being afraid of being killed, whereas the latter describes a similar fear, but that of having to kill one's adversary.
