Jonathan renders: וְאַלְהֵי עֲלוֹהִי This is an expression of weariness. [I.e., he lay exhausted upon him.] There is a similar word in the Baraitha of Haazinu and in Sifrei (references obscure). And Menahem interpreted [as follows]: The interpretation of the word according to its context, is: he prostrated himself upon him.

As far as a distress analogous to a woman sitting on the birth-stool, and she has no strength to give birth. The Hebrew is מַשְׁבֵּר - the name of the seat used by a woman who kneels to give birth.

Verse 23

The Temple Mount.
The Temple which whitens the sins (Heb. מַלְבִּין).
I will not return until I have destroyed it.
[lit. the lodge of] its end.
The fullness of its land and the beauty of its splendor.

Verse 24

I.e., to say, I started all my deeds and completed [them], as one who digs a hole and finds strange water and drinks it. Flowing water he calls “strange” since until now no one knew of them.
If I would besiege a city reliant upon its rivers, I would bring many troops upon it who would dry up its rivers with their drinking and the drinking of their cattle and by the treading of their feet.

Verse 25

Why do you boast and aggrandize yourself with this? This is not yours, for you have heard from afar through the prophets, that I decreed upon the nations to bring you upon them, as the matter that is written (Is. 7:4), “Ho, Assyria, the staff of My wrath.” [In Is. 37:26 Rashi adds:] More than seventy years since Amos prophesied two years before the earthquake (Amos 7:17), “and Israel shall be exiled from upon its land.” Since then, you should have heard that I wrought and prepared this retribution.
Since the world was created, it entered My thought, as it is said (Is. 30:33), “For Gehinnom is arranged from days of yore; that too was prepared for the king.” This refers to Sennacherib, who was burned in the fire of Gehinnom, as it is said (Is. 31:9), “The word of the Lord, Who has fire in Zion.”
And this is the power that is in your hand.
The coming of My decree [shall be] to make desolate fortified cities into blossoming hills, into piles of earth upon which vegetables grow, for you destroy them because of My decree.
[לַהְשׁוֹת in Heb.] an expression of desolation, loneliness.

Verse 26

Those whom weakened before you, and the might is not yours. You are not mighty, but they are weak.
Which hastens to dry.
Like ears of grain, blasted before they hardened to become standing grain.

Verse 27

Jonathan paraphrased: And your sitting in counsel, and your going out to wage war, and your coming to the land of Israel, is revealed to Me. It emanated from Me.
And the fact that you will become arrogant and aroused against Me with anger and tumult. (Estomir in O.F.)

Verse 28


[חַחִי in Heb.] A kind of ring by which they pull an animal whose behavior is bad, as we learned (Shabbat 5:1), “And all animals that are usually pulled with a ring may go out with a ring.”
[Heb. מִתְגִי,] Jonathan rendered זְמַם, which is [made] of iron, and which they insert into the nostrils of a female camel, and she is pulled with it, since her behavior is bad. This is what we learned (Shabbath ibid.) “and the female camel with a nose ring.”

Verse 29

The prophet said this to Hezekiah. And this [prophecy] which I said to you that Sennacherib will fall here, will be a sign for you also for the approaching days, for you are afraid of dying from hunger, since Sennacherib destroyed the land and chopped down the trees.
This year plants will grow for you, and you will be sustained by them.
The chopped off trees that will grow (the products of the trees that will grow), and when you see My word fulfilled concerning the fall of the armies, it will be a sign for you that this promise, too, will be fulfilled.

Verse 30



Verse 31

That He will be zealous for His honor and for His name, not that you have any merit, for Ahaz your father committed many wicked deeds.

Verse 32

He shall not set a shield before it. [In Isaiah 37:33, Rashi adds,] Since the Aramaic translation of “before” is קֳדָם.
[Heb. סֹלְלָה,] a heap of earth to raise a mount upon which to stand to embattle the city. Since one presses it down and beats it with sticks and sledge hammers, so that it be trodden and pressed down with strength, it is called סֹלְלָה, an expression similar to (Is. 62:10) “Beat down, beat down the highway.” [Heb. סֹלוּ סֹלוּ הַמְסִלָה.]

Verse 33



Verse 34



Verse 35

When Sennacherib returned from [warring] with Cush, and he came as far as Nob, which was near Jerusalem.
All of them were heads of companies.

Verse 36

That is the capital of the land of Assyria. [In Isaiah 37:37, Rashi adds,] as it is said (Gen. 10:11), “From that land Ashur came out, and he built Nineveh…”

Verse 37

A board from Noah’s ark.
They heard him that he said he would slaughter them before him if they (sic) (he- kara) [would save him so that the princes of the kingdom, whose sons perished because of him, would not kill him].
