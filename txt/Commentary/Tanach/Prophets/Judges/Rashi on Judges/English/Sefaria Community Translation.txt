To Simeon, his brother- To the tribe of Simeon.
Go up with me- And help me conquer what fell in my portion, and there are those who solve it as: "Judah will go up", this refers to Othniel, being Yabetz, like it says in Tractate Temura, 16a, "What is his [Othniel's] name?

Seventy kings etc. [with their thumbs and big toes cut off, gathered food under my table]- From here, we learn how great and wealthy the kings of Caanan were, for Adoni-Bezek wasn't great enough to be counted (in the census of thirty-one kings, cf.

And I gave also said- And now I said, in my wrath.

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6

And Joshua sent etc.- This action happened earlier (in the book of Joshua), and the only reason it came is because we will say, "And they did evil (Verse 11)," and so they started to tell [the story] like this.
Joshua- When he died (meaning, when he was about to die), they accepted before him the worship of G-d, and he sent each man to his allotment. They worshipped G-d all of his [remaining] days, and all the days of the elders, and afterwards: "And the children of Israel did evil (Judges 2:11)."

Verse 7

Who led for days etc.- They led for days, but they didn't lead for years, for they were lax in eulogizing [Joshua], which follows what it says: "Mount Ga'ash (meaning, the mountain of quaking) (Judges 2:9)," for the the mountain shook over them to kill them.

Verse 8



Verse 9

In Timnat Cheres- [It is called such] because they put an image of the sun (Heb. Tmunat Cheres) on [Joshua's] grave, as if to say, 'It is misfortune upon a man who held up the sun (Joshua 10:12-13) and is [now] found in the grave.
