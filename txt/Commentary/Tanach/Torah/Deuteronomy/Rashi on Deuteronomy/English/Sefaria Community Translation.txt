[This implies that] there is no one objecting to the matter, so you do not need to go to war in order to take possession of the land. Had they [the nation] not sent spies, they would not have needed weapons [to conquer the land]. 

Verse 9

"And I spoke unto you at that time, saying" - What is [the meaning of] 'saying'? Moses said to them, "I am not speaking to you by myself, rather from the mouth of the of the Holy One Blessed is He."

... " To follow in all of His ways"- He is merciful and you should be merciful, He performs acts of kindness and you should perform acts of kindness
..."And to cling to Him"- Is it possible to say thus? But is He not a consuming fire? Rather cling to Torah scholars and I will consider it about you as if you attached yourself to Him

Verse 11

You may take her as your wife: The Torah speaks only in deference to the wicked inclination, for if God would not permit her [to him], he would take her illicitly. However, if he does marry her, he will ultimately come to hate her, as it says afterwards, "If a man has [two wives]" and ultimately he will father from her a wayward rebellious son. This is why these topics are placed one after the other.
