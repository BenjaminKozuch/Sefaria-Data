G-d will set [a man] - Since Moshe heard G-d say [that he should] give Tzlophchad's inheritance [land] to his daughters (Bamidbar Rabba), he said: "The time has come that I should demand my own needs, that my sons should inherit my greatness."
Said G-d to him: "That is not my thoughts, rather Yehoshua merits this reward as he has not moved from [your] tent."
As Shlomo says (Mishlei 27:18): "The protector of a fig tree will eat its fruit, [and the guardian of his master will be honored]."
