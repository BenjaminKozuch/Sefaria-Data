Verse 1

"...After Abraham made a treaty with Avimelech, between him, their sons, their grandsons and their great grandsons, then God was angry with him because the land of the Philistines was part of the Land of Israel and the Holy One commanded 'You shall not let live any soul'; therefore, God 'provoked'" Abraham, and caused him pain. (Rashbam then cites examples in Tanach where the word "nisa" means "provoked" and not "tested".)This is to say that he (Abraham) was proud of the son that God had given him and made a covenant for this son and Avimelech's son. Now (says God) bring him as an offering on the altar and we will see what becomes of your covenant."The Rashbam continues by quoting a Midrash, that Hashem made an oath: "since you offered seven sheep (in the covenant ceremony) the Philistines will kill seven of your Righteous and destroy seven of your temples: Ohel Moed, Gilgal, Nov, Shilo, Givon, and the two Temples."
