Chapter 1

1} At what point my we begin reciting Shema in the evening?  From the time when people enter to eat their bread on Friday evenings, according to Rabbi Meir.  The Sages say: from the point at which the priests are permitted to eat of their terumah offerings, the symbol for this is the time when the stars come out.  Even though there is no Biblical proof for this argument, there is a hint at it: "half of them held on to the spears from dawn until the stars came out" (Nehemiah 4).

Chapter 2

One who says the Shema must remember the exodus from Egypt when saying "Emet V'Yatziv". Rabbi [Yehuda] says that one must remember the [Davidic] kingship. Aherim say that one  must remember the slaying of the first born and the dividing of the Red Sea.
