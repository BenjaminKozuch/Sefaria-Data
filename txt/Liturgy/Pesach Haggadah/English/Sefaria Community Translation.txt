Section 1

Raise the first glass.
Kiddush
On Shabbat begin with:
There was day and there was night
the sixth day. Were finished the heavens and the earth and all around
And Hashem finished on the seventh day all of His work that He did
And rested on the seventh day from all the work that he did.
And God blessed the seventh day and made it holy
