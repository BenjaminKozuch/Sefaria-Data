                " The difference between a grant (hakna’ah) and a legacy (hanhala) is vast. A grantor indeed transfers the object to the possession of the grantee, but such a transfer does not create a personal relationship or internal bond between the grantor and grantee. This is not true of a legacy. There, the benefactor appoints the beneficiary in his stead, and the beneficiary assumes the status of his benefactor. Thus, a legacy forges an intimate relationship between benefactor and beneficiary. This is the novel idea expressed by the verse: “Honor is the legacy of the wise” (Proverbs 3:35). The verse teaches us that wisdom does not simply grant honor to the wise; rather, wisdom gives honor as a legacy to those who possess it. -- Rabbi Yitzhak Hutner, Pahad Yitzhak (Shavuot), 16:10...",
