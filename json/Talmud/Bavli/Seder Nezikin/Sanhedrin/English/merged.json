            "Mishnah: Monetary cases with three [judges]. Theft and injury with three. Damages and half damages, double payment and quadruple and quintuple payment with three. \"Rape, seduction and 'motzi shem ra' (when a husband claims about the virginity of his bride) with three\"—the words of Rabbi Meir. But the Sages say: \"Motzi shem ra with twenty-three, because there is in it [an element of] a capital case.\" Lashes with three. Because of Rabbi Ishmael, they said with twenty-three. \"Intercalation of the month with three. Intercalation of the year with three\"—the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: \"We begin with three, with five we argue back and forth, and with seven we finish. But if you finish with three, then it has been intercalated.\"", 
            "\"'Semichat Zkeinim' (when the elders put their hands on the sacrifice to atone for a sin of the entire people) and the breaking of the calf's neck (when a body is found between jurisdictions) with three\"—the words of Rabbi Shimon. Rabbi Yehudah says: \"With five.\" 'Chalitzah' (the ceremony of giving up claim to your brother's widow) and 'Miunin' (nullification of a betrothal of a young girl) with three. Produce of the fourth year and second tithe whose value is not known with three. Things dedicated to the Temple with three. [Payment of a] vow with movable property with three. Rabbi Yehudah says: \"One of them should be a priest.\" [Payment of a vow with] immovable property with nine and a priest. A person [in payment of a vow] is like these. Capital cases with twenty-three. Bestiality, either party, with twenty-three, as it is said, \"You shall kill the woman and the beast,\" (Leviticus 20:16), and it says, \"the beast, you shall kill it\" (Leviticus 20:15). Stoned ox with twenty-three, as it is said, \"The ox you will stone and also its master will die\" (Exodus 21:29)—the death of the ox will be like the death of its master. The wolf, lion, bear, tiger, panther and snake—they die with twenty-three. Rabbi Eliezer says: \"Anyone who kills them before is correct.\" But Rabbi Akiva says: \"They die with twenty-three.\"", 
            "We do not judge a tribe, false prophet, or the High Priest except based on a court of seventy-one, and we don't go to a permitted war except based on a court of seventy-one. We do not annex a city or region except based on a court of seventy-one. We do not make a Sanhedrin for the tribes except based on a court of seventy-one. We do not proclaim an idolatrous city except based on a court of seventy-one; we do not proclaim an idolatrous city on the border [of the Land of Israel] nor do we proclaim three [idolatrous cities], but we do proclaim one or two. The Great Sanhedrin was with seventy-one, and the smaller twenty-three. How do we know that the greater had seventy-one? As it is said, \"Gather for me seventy people from the elders of Israel\" (Numbers 11:16), and Moses in addition to them. Rabbi Yehudah says: \"Seventy.\" And how do we know that the smaller had twenty-three? As it is said, \"You will judge the congregation and save the congregation\" (Numbers 35:24)—a 'congregation' judges and a 'congregation' saves, thus it is twenty. And how do we know a 'congregation' is ten? As it is said, \"How long for this evil congregation? Then came out Joshua and Caleb\" (Numbers 14:27) [i.e. there were ten evil spies remaining]. And where do we know to add the three? We learn, as it is said, \"Don't go after the majority to convict\" (Exodus 23:2). Should I learn that I should be with them for acquittal? If so, why does it say, \"after the majority [do not] incline\" (Exodus 23:2)? Your inclining to acquittal is not like your inclining to conviction. By one vote shall you incline to acquittal, and by two votes "

            "and we don't have an even court, so we add another one on those [twenty-two]—thus there are twenty-three. And how many people should there be in a city in order to have a Sanhedrin? One-hundred and twenty. Rabbi Nechemiah said: \"Two-hundred and thirty, so that they correspond to the rulers of ten [of the Israelites in the wilderness].", 
            "Gemara: But are thefts and injuries not [in the category] of monetary cases? Rabbi Abahu said: \"[The Mishnah] teaches an exhaustive list. [What are monetary cases?] Thefts and injuries, but confessions and loans are not.\" And [this language] is necessary: for, if it had taught [only] \"monetary cases\", than I would have thought that it included confessions and loans—thus, it teaches \"thefts and injuries\"; but if it had taught \"thefts and injuries\" and not taught \"monetary cases\", I would have thought that this was the law even for confessions and loans and the reason for it teaching \"thefts and injuries\" was because the essential [common factor] is three [judges], since it is written about both thefts and injuries—thefts, as it is written, \"The owner of the house will approach the judges\" (Exodus 22:7); injuries: what difference is an 'injury' in his body or his property? [and I would assume confessions and loans followed the same law]—thus it teaches: \"What are monetary cases? Thefts and injuries, but confessions and loans are not.\" But what [is the difference between thefts and injuries and confessions and loans]? If we say that [confessions and loans] do not require three [judges], did not Rabbi Abahu say that, \"Two that judge monetary cases, their judgement does not stand?\" Rather, [the difference is] that [confessions and loans] do not require experts. What is [the Mishnah's] explanation [for this]? If it holds that 'eruv parashiyot' applies here (a principle connecting one passage in Exodus 23 to another in order to require three judges for monetary cases), then it would require experts [here] also. And if it doesn't hold that 'eruv parashiyot' applies here, why does it [require] three [at all]? [The Mishnah] always holds that 'eruv parashiyot' applies here and that the law should be that we require also experts [in confessions and loans]. But the reason that we do not require experts is because of Rabbi Chanina, as Rabbi Chanina said: \"According to the Torah, monetary and capital cases are the same when it comes to cross-examination [of the witnesses]"

[No, for] how could it be with [three] tramps at street corners that one of them wasn't learned? Following from this [reasoning], if they err [perhaps] they shouldn't [have to] pay? All the more so would this increase [the problem of] tramps at street corners [judging confessions and loans].—What is the difference between [the positions of] Rava and Rav Acha son of Rav Ika? This is the difference: as Shmuel said, \"Two [judges] that judge a case, their judgements stand but they are called a rebellious court\"—Rava holds according to Shmuel, Rav Acha son of Rav Ika does not hold according to Shmuel.",

            "Three [judges]—where [do we know this] from?! As our rabbis taught: \"'\"The owner will come before the judges [HaElohim, lit. God]\" (Exodus 22:7)—this is one. \"The matter of both [litigants] shall come before the judges [HaElohim]\" (Exodus 22:8)—this is two. \"Which the judges [HaElohim] shall declare guilty\" (Exodus 22:8)—this is three.\"—the words of Rabbi Yoshayah. Rabbi Yonatan says: 'The first was stated as a first instance and we don't expound from first instances [i.e. we can't use the first appearance of a word in our explanation]. Instead, \"The matter of both [litigants] shall come before the judges [HaElohim]\" (Exodus 22:8)—this is one. \"Which the judges [HaElohim] shall declare guilty\" (Exodus 22:8)—this is two. There are no even-numbered courts so we add upon them another one—this is three.'\" Let us say that it is about [this principle] of not expounding from first instances that they disagree, that one master things we do expound from first instances and the other master thinks we do not expound from first instances. No! According to everyone we don't expound from first instances. Rabbi Yoshayah would say to you: \"If so, the verse should state 'the owner shall come to the judge [hashofet]'! Why 'to God [HaElohim]'?\" We learn from this that [this word] is in the counting. And Rabbi Yonatan [would say to you]: \"It is using normal language—as people say—for a person who has a case to bring to the judge.\" But does Rabbi Yoshayah not hold by [the principle] of [not having] an odd-numbered court? Is it not taught: \"Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yose HaGlili said: 'What does the verse teach, \"After the majority you should incline\" (Exodus 23:2)? \"To incline\"—the Torah says, \"Make for yourself an odd-numbered court\" [lit. an inclined court]'\"?! He thinks according to Rabbi Yehudah, who says \"seventy\", as it is taught: \"The Great Sanhedrin had seventy-one. But Rabbi Yehudah says: 'Seventy'.\" Let's say that you learn this for Rabbi Yehudah concerning the Great Sanhedrin as the verses are written; with all other courts, could you learn this for him? Or you could say there's no difference [between the Great Sanhedrin and other courts], for is it not taught: \"'The laying of the hands of the elders and the ceremony of the breaking of the calf's neck with three [judges]'—the words of Rabbi Shimon. And Rabbi Yehudah says: 'With five'\"—and we say what the reasoning is for Rabbi Yehudah: \"'They will lay their hands'—this is two; 'elders'—this is two (Leviticus 4:15)—and there is no even-numbered court, so we add upon them another one—this is five.\"!? Rabbi Yoshayah['s opinion] seems more forceful than Rabbi Yehudah's, because if with the Great Sanhedrin Rabbi Yehudah does not have [the requirement of having an odd-numbered court] then in all other courts he does; but Rabbi Yoshayah, in all other courts he does not also. However, what does [Rabbi Yoshayah] do [with the word] \"to incline\"? He assigns it to capital cases but not to monetary cases. But it is taught [in the Mishnah]: \"Two [judges] that say he is acquitted, one that says he is liable, he is acquitted; two that say he is liable, one that says he is acquitted, he is liable\"! [I.e. it assumes majority rule in monetary cases]. Can we say that this [Mishnah] is not in accordance with Rabbi Yoshayah? No! It can even be said from Rabbi Yoshayah['s view]. He would derive it from a kal vahomer (a principle deriving the law for a more lenient case from a more stringent case) from capital cases. Since capital cases are so stringent and God says, \"Go after the majority\", all the more so in monetary cases.", 
            "Our rabbis taught: \"Monetary cases with three [judges]; Rabbi said: 'With five, so that the case will be completed with three [i.e. the ruling will come from at least three judges].'\" But if we have three, can the case not be completed with two? This is what [Rabbi] meant: \"Because the case is completed with three.\" Therefore, when the Torah says three, it is written concerning the case's completion. Rabbi Abahu ridiculed this: \"From this [reasoning], the Great Sanhedrin would need one-hundred and forty-one in order to complete the case with seventy-one! And the lesser Sanhedrin would need forty-five in order to complete the case with twenty-three! Rather, 'Gather me seventy people' (Numbers 11:16); God says, from the time of gathering [there should be] seventy.  'Judge the congregation; save the congregation' (Numbers 35:24) is also from the time of judging the congregation. So too, 'The owner shall approach the judges' (Exodus 22:7) is from the time of approach. Rather, this is the reasoning of Rabbi: 'That the judges [HaElohim, in the plural] declare guilty' (Exodus 22:8)—two. Judges [Elohim] is said below and is said above; just as below [it indicates] two, so too above [it indicates] two, and there is no even-numbered court, [so we] add upon them an additional one—this is five.\"",

            "R. Simeon said: They14  remained in the Camp. For when the Holy One, blessed be He, ordered Moses: Gather unto me seventy of the elders of Israel, Eldad and Medad observed, 'We are not worthy of that dignity.' Thereupon the Holy One, blessed be He, said, 'Because you have humbled yourselves, I will add to your greatness yet more greatness.' And how did He add to their dignity? — In that all [the other prophets] prophesied and ceased, but their prophesying did not cease. And what did they prophesy? — They said, 'Moses shall die and Joshua shall bring Israel into the land.'", 
            "Abba Hanin said on the authority of R. Eliezer: They prophesied concerning the matter of the quails,15  [saying], 'Arise, quail; arise, quail.'", 
            "R. Nahman said: They prophesied concerning Gog and Magog.16  as it is said, Thus saith the Lord God: Art thou he of whom I spoke in old time by My servants the prophets of Israel, that prophesied in those days for many years17  that I would bring thee against them? etc.18  Read not 'shanim' [years] but 'shenayim' [two].19  And which two prophets prophesied the same thing at the same time? — Say, they are Eldad and Medad.", 
            "The Master said: 'All the other prophets prophesied and ceased, but they prophesied and did not cease.' Whence do we infer that the others ceased? Shall we say, from the verse, They prophesied 'velo yasafu' [but they did so no more]?20  If so, what of the passage. With a great voice, velo yasaf?21  Does that too mean, it went on no more?22  But that must be interpreted, It did not cease!23  — But here24  it is written, And they prophesied,25  whereas there26  it is stated, [they] were prophesying,27  i.e., they were still continuing to prophesy.", 
            "Now, according to the statement [that they prophesied] that Moses would die, [Joshua's request,] My Lord Moses, forbid them, is understandable; but on these two other views,28  why [did he say], My Lord Moses, forbid them29  — Because their behaviour was not seemly, for they were like a disciple who decides questions in the very presence of his teacher. Now, according to these two other opinions [the wish expressed by Moses,] Would that all the Lord's people were prophets29  is reasonable; but on the view [that they prophesied] that Moses would die, was he then pleased therewith? — They did not complete their prophecy in his presence. How was Moses to 'forbid them' [as Joshua requested]? He [Joshua] said to him: Lay upon them public cares, and they will cease [prophesying] of themselves.30"

            "It has been taught:  R. Jose said; Originally there were not many disputes in Israel, but one Beit Din of seventy-one members sat in the Hall of Hewn Stones, and two courts of twenty-three sat, one at the entrance of the Temple Mount and one at the door of the Court, and other courts of twenty-three sat in all Jewish cities.  If a matter of inquiry arose, the local Beit Din was consulted.  If they had a tradition they stated it; if not, they went to the nearest Beth Din.  If they had a tradition, they stated it; if not, they went to the one situated at the entrance of the Court, and he declared, “Thus I have expounded, and thus have my colleagues expounded; thus have I taught and thus have they taught.”  If they had a tradition, they stated it, and if not, they all proceeded to the Hall of Hewn Stones, where they (Sanhedrin) sat from the morning tamid, until the evening tamid.  On Shabbat and festivals they sat within the hel.  The question was then put before them; if they had a tradition they stated it; if not, they took a vote: if the majority voted “unclean” they declared it so; if “clean” they ruled so.  But when the disciples of Shammai and Hillel, who had insufficiently studied, increased in number, disputes multiplied in Israel, and the Torah became as two Torot."
