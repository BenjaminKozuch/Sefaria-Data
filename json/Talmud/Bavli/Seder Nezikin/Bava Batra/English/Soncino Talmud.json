            "...the family of the father is regarded [as the proper] family [but] the family of the mother is not regarded [as the proper] family; for it is written, \"by their families, by their father's houses\" [(Numbers 1:22, referring to the census.) But] is not the mother's family regarded [as the proper] family? Surely it is written, \"And there was a young man out of Bethlehem in Judah — of the family of Judah — who was a Levite, and he sojourned there;\" (Judges 17:7)  [now], this is self-contradictory, [for] it is said, \"who was a Levite\", which clearly indicates that he descended from Levi, [and it is also said], \"of the family of Judah,\" which clearly shows that he descended from Judah; must it not then be concluded that his father [was of the tribe] of Levi and his mother [of that] of Judah, and [yet the text] speaks [of him as] \"of the family of Judah\"!"
