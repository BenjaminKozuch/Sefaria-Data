If we made them unfit for the Temple service, and they are Kohanim, we make their children unfit forever. If you'll say let us invalidate them alone and not their children, we need to fulfill \"as they planned\", and this wouldn't be doing that, since they planned to invalidate the accused and his children.",

Rather, [it is referring to] witnesses that made wicked a righteous one and came another set of witnesses and they vindicated the original righteous one and changed these [first witnesses] into wicked ones, if that will be then beat the wicked one [with lashes].", 
                "<b>We don't say this one goes to exile.</b> Since it is written regarding a murderer (Deuteronomy 19:5) \"He shall flee\", he [the murdeer] and not <i>zommemin</i>.", 
                "<b>That he divorced his wife.</b> in front of us such and such a day, and this one [the accused] says \"I did not divorce her and I am not obligated to pay her <i>ketubah</i>.", 
                "<b>Is it not that either today or tomorrow.</b> Meaning what do they [the <i>zomemin</i>] pay to him [the accused]? If you say the entire <i>ketubah</i>, perhaps he will die or perhaps he will divorce her today or tomorrow and in the end pay her anyways, and then it comes out that they weren't making him lose anything.",

Since if she is widowed or divorced the one who purchased the <i>ketubah</i> will take [the whole value], and if she dies her husband inherits her and [the purchaser] loses the money he gave [for the <i>ketubah</i>], and this is what the [<i>zomemin</i>] witnesses stipulate to the husband."

                "<b>All who pay don't get lashed.</b> Since it is written \"According to his wickedness\", you make him liable [for lashes] because of his one act wickedness, and you don't make him liable for two acts of wickedness. And from the fact that the Rabbis say he [the <i>zommemin</i>] pays and doesn't get lashed and they didn't say he gets lashed and doesn't pay, we learn from this that all instances of liability for both lashes and paying, we don't say he'll get lashed and not pay, rather he pays and doesn't get lashed.

Here [in this case], where there is warning against \"you shall not bear false witness\" and also \"as they planned\", they are lashed 80 [times]. The halacha is not like Rabbi Meir.",

If it was three witnesses and they were made <i>zommemin</i>, each one pay a third of the [total] money that they wanted to cause him [the person they are testifying about] to lose. ", 
                "<b>Lashes are not divided.</b> It's not that each of the witnesses are lashed a portion of the [total number of] lashes, rather each one is lashed 40 [times]. This is because we need \"do to them as they planned\", and each one sought to have the accused lashed a full amount. [However] money is combined [after being divided], when each of the witnesses gives their portion, behold he [the accused] receives what they sought to make him lose, however lashes are not combined."
