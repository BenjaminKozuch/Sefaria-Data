                "These and these are the words of the Living God - The Rabbis of France asked, how is it possible that both can be \"words of the Living God\" when one says to forbid and one says to permit? They explained, that when Moses ascended to Heaven to receive the Torah, it was demonstrated to him on every matter forty-nine ways to forbid and forty-nine ways to permit. He asked God about this, and He responded that it was given over to the Jewish scholars of each generation the authority to decide among these perspectives",
