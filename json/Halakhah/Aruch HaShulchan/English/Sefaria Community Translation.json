                "It is written, \"His angels will be commanded to you, to watch over you on all of your travels\". On Shabbos (Meseches (Tractate) Shabbos) 119b we say,\"two angles escort a person\". In Chagigah 16a, it comes to say, \" the two angles that escort this person testify on his behalf\". Therefore, the Sages commanded (Brachos 60b) that when one needs to enter the bathhouse,  he should say before he enters \"be honored, respected and holy ones, the rulers of above! Watch over me! Watch over me! Help me! Help me! Wait for me until I enter and come out, since this is the way of man!\". Its explanation: This person is mentioning that the angels are too holy to enter into the bathhouse and therefore, they should wait for him to exit from there. He is asking them to protect him from demons. This is the true meaning of that which is written, \"His angels will be commanded to you, to watch over you on all of your travels\". Meaning, wherever one is forced to go, even into a place where the angles cannot enter. The mentioned safeguarding is from demons as was written in prior times, \"You shall not fear the fright of night...destruction that ravages at noon\" (Tehillim 91). This that one says, \"Help me!\" is in regard to cleanliness since at the exit of the uncleanliness (excrement) is something that dependent upon all beings; therefore, one says,\"this is the way of man!\", meaning, \"what shall be done if someone is forced to do this?\".", 
                "Now, we no longer have the tradition to say this (\"be honored...\"). This was the tradition of the first and pious whose thoughts were always devoted to G-d. About them it is said, \"He who dwells in the covert of the Most High will lodge in the shadow of the Almighty\" (Psalms 91:1). They felt the holiness of those who escorted them (the angels) and therefore, it was pleasant for them to say so (\"be honored...\"). We (in modern times), also have the escort of angles, like the sages of blessed memory have explained (and as we have explained above); however, we can not feel their holiness at all. Our saying this is considered arrogant and egotistical and it appears as arrogance as well. Certainly a holy man who is involved with Torah in holiness needs to say this, but not us, only regular people. This is the essence  and this is the practice. (The \"Artzot HaChaim\" questions this, but the way I have written this is correct. Refer and you find it easily).",

                "Synagogues and study halls have great holiness since we pray in them and learn in them Torah. These locations have a reflection of the sanctity of the Temple. Our wise ones of blessed memory said, \"And these will be small Temples\" (Megilah 29a)-these are the Synagogues and study halls. And this that is written, \"O Lord, You have been our dwelling place throughout all generations\"(Psalms 90:1)- these are the Synagogues and study halls.  Even in the time of the destruction [of the Temple], they still have sanctity as it is written, \"and I will desolate your sanctuaries\" (Lev. 26:31)-\"They are still sanctuaries even when they are desolate\" (Megilah 28a). Therefore, Synagogues and study halls are not treated with lightheartedness, for example, with games, humor and small talk. The Arizal (R' Issac Luria) was very careful to only speak words of prayer in the Synagogue. Even words of rebuke should not be spoken, least it lead to the discussion of mundane matters. (Magen Avraham  Subsection 3). ", 
                "We do not eat and we do not drink in them, even a temporary (short) consumption. We do not get dressed in them and we do not travel through them. We do not use them to take shelter from the heat when it is hot outside or from the rain when it is raining. Learned ones and their students are allowed to eat in them in urgent situations. Some say that they can eat in a study hall, even if the situation is not urgent, since for most of the day, they will be there to learn anyway. If so [if they would have to leave], this would be a waste of [ time that could be spent learning] Torah when they would have to step out of there to eat. However, to take shelter there from the rain or from the heat or cold is still prohibited, even for a learned person. Rather, he would have to learn there, or in a Synagogue, he would have to pray there (Magen Avraham subsection 2). There is in the Yerushalmi that a learned person is allowed  lodge in a study hall (Magen Avraham subsection 2). And like this it sounds like in Pesachim (Pesachim 100a). At seems that guests can eat in the study hall. However, in truth, the Tosfos write there that this is referring to the rooms next to the Synagogue, see there. (Refer to the Ta\"z subsection 1. His words are puzzling. In addition, the Ramban did not write this, just because of a condition, see there.)",

                "Shechita (Ritual slaughtering as dictated in Jewish Law) is a \"positive\" mitzvah. Shecita is not obligatory (as the case with obligations of Shofar, Succah and Lulav) since if one does not want to eat meat, there is no need to shecht (slaughter) . However, if someone does want to eat meat- there is an obligation to eat the animal only after shechting it, as the verse says, \"You shall sacrifice your cattle and sheep like you have been commanded\"(Deut. 12:21). Similarly, the shechita of a wild animal (that is kosher) is dictated by Torah law as the verse says regarding a firstborn animal that has a blemish, \"...the same way he will eat the deer and the buck\" (Deut. 12:22). One learns from this that a wild animal is alike to a domesticated animal in terms of Shechita (See the Sifrei HaMitzvos of the Rambam and the Smag). Furthermore, the shechita of birds is dictated by the Torah since the verse says, \"that he will hunt a hunted animal or bird and will pour its blood\" (Lev. 17:13). It is concluded from this verse that the pouring of the blood of a bird (which is part of the shechita process of that bird) is the same as that of an animal (see Sifri on Parshas Re'eh). It was taught by Bar Kafra- \"This is the set of rules for the animal and the bird and anything that lives in the water\" (Lev. 11). 'The bird' has been placed in between 'the animal' and 'anything that lives in the water'...",
