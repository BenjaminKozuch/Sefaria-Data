And even though there is more un-dedicated produce than dedicated. What case are we speaking of? One of dedicated produce in our times, which is a Rabbinic commandment; but dedicated produce that derives from a Torah commandment, until the un-dedicated food outnumbers the dedicated food [a non-priest cannot eat it].",
