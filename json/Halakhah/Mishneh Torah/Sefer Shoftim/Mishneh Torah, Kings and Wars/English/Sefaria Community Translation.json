            "However, if either the seven nations or Amalek refuse to accept a peaceful settlement, not one soul of them may be left alive as ibid. 20:15-16 states: 'Do this to all the cities that ... are not the cities of these nations. However, from the cities of these nations,... do not leave a soul alive.' Similarly, in regard to Amalek, Deuteronomy 25:19 states: 'Obliterate the memory of Amalek.'..."

            "Regarding six things Adam the First was commanded:  regarding foreign worship, and cursing [lit. blessing] God, and spilling blood, and forbidden sexual relations, and theft, and a justice system.  Even though they are all received traditions in our hands from our teacher Moses, and reason is inclined to them from the principles of the Torah, it appears that regarding these he was commanded.  He added for Noah [the prohibition on eating] the limb of a live animal, as it is said \"but flesh in its life its blood you shall not eat.\"  We find seven commandments.  And so was the matter in the whole world until Abraham.  Abraham came and he was commanded, in addition to these, with circumcision.  And he prayed shaharit.  And Isaac separated a tithe and added another prayer as the day wanes.  And Jacob added the [fobidden] sinew and prayed arvit.  And in Egypt Amram was commanded with additional commandments, until Moses our teacher came and the Torah was completed by him."

            "The King the Messiah (lit. the annointed) will stand up and return the Kingdom of the house of David to its old [glory], to the first rule, and build the Temple (lit. holy), and gather the scattered ones of the Israel, and return all of the laws in his days as they were before; bringing sacrifices, and making shmitahs (leaving the land fallow on the seventh year) and jubilees like all of the commandments that it says in the Torah.  And any who does not believe in him, or does not anticipate his arrival, it is not only in the other prophets that he is denying but in the Torah and in Moses our teacher; because the Torah testifies on him [the Messiah] as it says \"and Hashem your Lord will return your captives and your pitied ones, and return and gather . . . if you scattered ones are at the end of the heavens . . . and Hashem will bring them to you.\"  And these express words in the Torah they include all of the things that were said by the hand of all of the prophets.
