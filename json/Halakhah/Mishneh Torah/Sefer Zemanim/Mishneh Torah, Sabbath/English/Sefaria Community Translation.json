            "The Sabbath is pushed off when it comes to danger to life, like the rest of the commandments..  Therefore, they do all the needs of a sick person who is in [lifethreatening] danger on the Sabbath, according to the instructions of the professional doctor of that place.  If there is a doubt whether he needs to have Sabbath desecrated for him or not, and so if one doctor said to desecrate the Sabbath and one say he does not need it, they desecrate the Sabbath for him, because a doubt regarding lives pushes off the Sabbath."
