            "Tefillin and Mezuzot cannot be written except for in Assyrian script. And for Torah scrolls, they allowed it to be written also in Greek, but this Greek language has already disappeared from the world and been lost, so today all three may only be written in Assyrian script. And he must be careful in their writing that two letters not stick together, for any letter that is not surrounded by parchment on all four sides is disqualified. And any letter that a child who is not wise, nor a fool, cannot read is disqualified. Therefore, he must be careful with forming the letters that a yud not look like a vav, nor a vav a yud, nor a kaf a bet, nor a bet a kaf, nor a dalet a reish, nor a reish a dalet, and the like, until the reader will not have trouble."
