The time when people customarily lie down is evening and the time when people customarily get up is morning.",
            "What does one recite? The three paragraphs beginning with the words Hear (Deut. 6:4-9); If, then, you obey (Deut. II: 13-21); and The Lord said (Num. 15:37-41). The paragraph Hear is recited first because it contains commandments concerning God's unity, the love of God, and the study of God, which is the basic principle on which all depends? After it, If, then, you obey, is recited since the passage commands obedience to all the other commandments. After that, the paragraph concerning the fringes is recited, since it also contains a command to recall all the commandments.",
