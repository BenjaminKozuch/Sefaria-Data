And our rabbis spoke highly of the importance of this mitzvah (in Shabbat 118)... And similarly in every location, one should delight in Shabbat according to the custom, with food and drink that is considered delight for them. And since in general, most people get their delight from meat and wine and sweets, therefore we learn...that one should have a lot of meat and wine and sweets according to one’s abilities."

Be very careful to not bathe for the mitzvah and have the concern of violating Shabbos. And with many sins, many fail in this in the winter days and short days that if wait a short amount, it will get dark. And even if you complete your washing permissibly, also be careful of a prohibition because at times you will comb your hair afterwards, which is a Torah violation of Shabbos. Also another thing that's found is to squeeze out the towel from the water that it was holding. This is the prohibition of M'chabeis (laundering). It is proper for all who fear god with their hearts, to warn the nation not to do this. And their is a principle that if the nation does a sin you could've stopped, you also recieve punishment. However, if you stop the nation from doing this, you are also rewarded. If you don't stop the people in your house, you get the sin of the people in your house. If you don't stop the people in your city, you get the sin of your city.",
