            "The essence of the mitzvah of delight in Shabbat is explained to us by the prophets, as it says: “and you shall call the Sabbath a delight,” and there are authorities who believe that the essence is from the Torah, for Shabbat is part of the times that are called holy... as is explained in the Sifra... And our rabbis spoke highly of the importance of this mitzvah (in Shabbat 118)... And similarly in every location, one should delight in Shabbat according to the custom, with food and drink that is considered delight for them. And since in general, most people get their delight from meat and wine and sweets, therefore we learn...that one should have a lot of meat and wine and sweets according to one’s abilities."

Be very careful to not bathe for the mitzvah and have the concern of violating Shabbos. And with many sins, many fail in this in the winter days and short days that if wait a short amount, it will get dark. And even if you complete your washing permissibly, also be careful of a prohibition because at times you will comb your hair afterwards, which is a Torah violation of Shabbos. Also another thing that's found is to squeeze out the towel from the water that it was holding. This is the prohibition of M'chabeis (laundering). It is proper for all who fear god with their hearts, to warn the nation not to do this. And their is a principle that if the nation does a sin you could've stopped, you also recieve punishment. However, if you stop the nation from doing this, you are also rewarded. If you don't stop the people in your house, you get the sin of the people in your house. If you don't stop the people in your city, you get the sin of your city.",

            "It is a good practice to bring... - In order to educate them in the commandment of publicizing the miracle.  For this reason the community is accustomed to read these verses out loud (infra, 690:17), which are the essence of the beginning of the miracle and its end, i.e. \"There was a Jewish man,\" \"And Mordechai went out,\" \"For the Jews,\" \"For Mordechai\" - in order to wake up the little ones that they not sleep, and they will pay attention to the reading, and they read the verses to them to teach them (Levush).", 
            "Young boys and girls - So long as they do not bring very young ones, who confuse the listeners.", 
            "To hear, etc. - But now, in our many sins, it is reversed.  For not only do they not listen, but they mix it up so that the adults also cannot listen, and the only reason they come is to beat Haman.  In this way the father does not fulfill the commandment of education at all.  In truth, from the perspective of the commandment of education, every father has to keep his young children near him, and to supervise them that they listen to the reading, and when the reader gets to mentioning the name of Haman the Aggagite, the child is permitted to hit as is his custom, but not that that should be the primary purpose of bringing the child to the study hall.", 
            "The reading of the Megillah - And now, everyone should have a kosher megillah and read in an undertone word for word, because it is impossible to hear from the leader because of the noise and commotion, that they hit with sticks and make noise.  And it is appropriate for every Jew to behave this way if he can.  And see infra, 690:4."
