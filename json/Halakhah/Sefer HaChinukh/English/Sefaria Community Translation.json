            "The mitzvah of procreation: In parshat Bereishit there is one positive commandment and that is the mitzvah of procreation as it says (Genesis 1:28): 'And God blessed them and told them to procreate'.", 
            "The root of this mitzvah (i.e the reason behind this commandment) is that the world should be settled (B.T Gittin 41b) because God wants the world to be settled as it says (Isaiah 45:18)'I did not create it for naught, but [rather] formed it for habitation'. This is a big mitzvah with which all the mitzvos are observed because [the Torah] was given to humans [who need to procreate] and not to angels [who don't].", 
            "The laws of this mitzva including when a man is obligated to engage himself in it, and how many sons he needs to have, and what other mitzvot he is exempt from due to his involvement in procreation, as well as many other laws are explained in the sixth chapter of tractate Yevamot (61b and 62b) and in Berachot (16a). [It is also codified as practical law in] Shulcan Aruch [section] Even Haezer chapter 1, and in [section] Orach Chaim chapter 70:3.", 
            "This [mitzvah] applies in all places and at all times (in history-not every moment of one's life) (Kidushin  36b), and a person is obligated to engage in this mitzvah when it is fitting for him and this is the age which the sages (Avot 5:21) says to marry a woman [which is age 18]. This mitzvah is not obligatory for woman. One who refrains from this mitzvah is responsible for not engaging in a positive commandment and his punishment is very great (Kiddushin 29b) because he shows that he does not want to fulfill God's will to settle the world."

Rather, it is a prohibition of God that they (the Jews) shall not eat it.", 
            "Of the roots of this commandment: To serve as an indication to Israel that though they will suffer many oppressions in the exile by the nations and the descendents of Esau (i.e. the Christians), [the Jews] should trust that they will not perish, but rather that their descendents and name will stand firm forever, and that their redeemer will come and redeem them from their oppressor. And in continually remembering this idea through the commandment that serves as a reminder, they will stand firm in their faith and righteousness forever. And this indication [stems from the fact that] that angel who fought with Jacob our forefather, who according to tradition (Genesis Rabbah 78) was the guardian angel of Esau, wished to eliminate Jacob from the world, he and his descendents, but could not get the better of him, (Genesis 32:26) and anguished him in injuring his thigh. Likewise, Esau's descendents anguish Jacob's descendents, but in the end, [the latter] will be saved from them. As we find (Genesis 32:32) with respect to [our] forefather that the sun shone to heal him and he was saved from anguish, so will the sun of the Messiah shine, and he will heal us from our anguish and redeem us speedily in our days, amen!",

            "The commandment of sanctifying the new month—to sanctify months and intercalate [months into] years in the Court [whose members are the] greatest in wisdom and ordained in the Land of Israel, and to establish the year's holidays according to that sanctification, as it says, \"This month shall be to you the first of months.\" (Exodus 12:2) This means, when you see the renewal of the moon, establish for yourselves the new month, or even if you do not see it, since it is appropriate for [the moon] to appear according to the accepted calculation. Likewise, this commandment includes the commandment of intercalation, since the basis of the commandment to sanctify the month is for Israel to observe God's holidays at their appointed times. And the commandment of intercalation  has the same basis. However, beyond this verse are more Torah passages concerning the commandment of intercalation, as it is written, \"You shall observe this commandment in its proper time\" (Exodus 13:10); and likewise, \"Observe the month of Abib.\" (Deuteronomy 16:11)", 
            "The procedure of the commandment: Two Jews fit to testify come before the court and testify before them that they saw the renewed moon. They establish the new month on the basis of their [testimony] and say, \"Today has been sanctified.\" The reason why this commandment applies only with ordained judges is because of the interpretation [of the verse], \"This month shall be for you,\" i.e. great [in Torah] and ordained, like you (Rosh Hashanah 22a), since [this verse] was said to Moses and Aaron. This matter was further expounded, as it is juxtaposed to \"speak to the entire congregation of the children of Israel,\" meaning that they who sanctify the month must have the assent of all Israel, meaning the wisest men of Israel, such as the Great Court (the Sanhedrin). And so any great wise man in Israel who was ordained in the Land of Israel. And since ordination is no longer practiced, as is known, [the wise man] has permission to perform this commandment even outside the Land of Israel, so long as there is no one of his statue in the Land of Israel. And so we find that Hanania ben Ahai, R. Joshua, and R. Akiba ben Yosef did so in this regard. (Berakhot 23a) But without these conditions, no one of Israel is permitted to establish the months or intercalate. And if you ask: If so, how do we conduct ourselves today, when we lack ordained wise men? Know that thus we have received [our calendar], since R. Hillel the Prince, son of R. Judah the Prince, who was the greatest of his generation and ordained in the Land of Israel—he was the wise man who fixed for us the calculation of intercalation, sanctified future months, and intercalated  future [months into] years until the coming of Elijah (i.e. until the Messianic Era), and it is upon this that we rely today. That which we have said all follows the opinion of Maimonides. However, Nahmanides (in the Book of Commandments, Positive Commandments, number 153), considers the sanctification of the month as one commandment and intercalation a separate commandment. His proofs (for dividing these into two separate commandments are) in his Book of Commandments. And so the Ba'al Halakhot (considers these separate commandments). And the verse that teaches about the commandment of intercalation, that is, that we calculate the seasons in order to make the holidays in their (proper,) established times, is \"\"You shall observe this commandment in its proper time,\" (Exodus 13:10) and so, \"Observe the month of Abib,\" (Deuteronomy 16:11) as we have written....", 
            "Of the roots of this commandment: so that Israel shall make God's holidays in their (proper) times, as God commanded that we make Passover in the time of produce, the spring, as is written, \"Observe the month of Abib, and you shall offer the Passover sacrifice.\" (Deuteronomy 16:1) And the holiday of Sukkot is [to fall] at the time of the [fruit] harvest, as is written,  \"And the Festival of the Harvest at the turn of the year.\" (Exodus 34:22) And were it not for intercalation, the holidays would come not at these times, since Israel calculates their months and festivals according to the lunar year, which has 354 days, 8 hours, and 876 halakim , which is less than the solar year by 10 days, 21 hours, and 204 halakim, (a mnemonic: 10, 21, 204). Due to the ripening of the produce and fruit from the power of the sun, it turns out that but for intercalation, by which we align the lunar and solar years, Passover would not come in spring, nor Sukkot at the time of the [fruit] harvest. And this matter is to be fixed by the greatest [scholars] of the generation, since it is a matter requiring great wisdom, and since it is also said that from this [calculation one comes to know] the agricultural happenings of the year, it is appropriate to give [this task] only to great and pious men.", 
            "The laws of this commandment, [including]—interrogating [those who offer] testimony concerning the new month; instilling fear in the witnesses on occasion; the law concerning circumstances under which the Sabbath may be desecrated for this testimony; for what [considerations] we do or do not intercalate; and which month they would intercalate, i.e. Adar, as [our Sages] expounded: \"You shall observe this commandment in its proper time\" (Exodus 13:10): this teaches that we only intercalate at the time near the holiday. And furthermore did they expound on this verse: From where do we know that we only intercalate the month during daytime? [We learn this from the] verse, [which] says, \"from year to year\" (yamim yemima, a play on yom, day) (Sanhedrin 10b); and furthermore did they expound: \"For the months of the year\" (Exodus 12:2): it is months you calculate towards the year, not days. (Megillah 5a) Furthermore did they say on this matter: \"A month's time (hodesh yamim)\": it is days (yamim) you calculate towards the month, not hours (Megillah 5a); and the rest of its details—are explained in Tractate Rosh Hashanah (25b), and in the first chapter of Sanhedrin (11b), and similarly in Berakhot. (Maimonides, Laws of Sanctification of the New Month 1)", 
            "[This commandment] applies in all places and at all times when we have ordained wise men, according to the aforementioned conditions. One who transgresses and does not [sanctify the new month or intercalate the month], if he be a wise man for whom it is appropriate, has neglected a positive commandment, and his punishment is very great since he causes the ruining of the holidays. And now, when in our sins we no longer have intercalation by ordained [scholars], our calculation relies on the accepted calculation from R. Hillel, as we have said. "

            "[This commandment] applies to men and women when the Holy Temple is standing. One who transgresses wantonly and does not offer the Paschal sacrifice, is liable to receive karet. [One who transgresses] inadvertently does not bring a sacrifice (to atone), since this [commandment] is one of three sins whose wanton transgression is punishable by karet, but whose inadvertent transgression does not [mandate bringing] a sin-offering, and these are this [commandment, i.e. neglecting the Paschal sacrifice], blasphemy, and neglecting the [commandment] of circumcision."

The Torah therefor was not concerned with permitted him to become defiled under any circumstance, even for the relatives where the Torah is concerned about [the well being of] the ordinary priest who will pour out his soul in the house of mourning because of the emotional closeness he feels to the deceased.  the Hight Priest, by contrast, is so throughly bound to loftier pursuits and is entirely separate from human nature.  He has lost any memory of this fleeting world; he will not weep for the loss of one of his society because he was already apart from them in life.

Perhaps you will say, \"How can we know if this maid has thought lustfully about another man?\"  The response is that for as long as the thought has not been actualized is does not disqualify her, but anytime she had cohabited she is disqualified. Even though Those of Blessed Memory said, \"when she matures she is prohibited,\" the idea is that once she has matured so much her thoughts are pure evil, and perhaps she lusted after another, and since she is an adult her evil thoughts count as a deed."

The blemish refered to in this context is permanent, as is explained in the Sifra (Emor 3:5), \"'Who has a blemish shall not serve' only includes a permanent blemish, how do we know to include a transient blemish?

In the opposite case, a person who is of low form and unusual appearance will seem unworthy in the eyes of his beholders if his actions are any less than perfect.  It is therefor appropriate that the person on whom atonement depends be of pleasant appearance in all facets so that people will attach their thoughts to him.  Aside from this, it is possible that in his perfect form there is a hint to certain concepts, for as a person contemplates[the perfect form] he will purify his soul and elevate it.  Therefor it is improper for there to be anything unusual in any form in him, lest the soul of the contemplative be scattered due to the anomaly, for it would then be moved from the purpose.", 
            "The laws of the mitzvah:  What Those of Blessed Memory (TBM) said (Talmud, Bechorot 43a), that there are three kinds of blemishes.  Some blemishes disqualify a priest from performing the service, and if similar blemishes were to be found on an animal, the animal would be ineligible to be offered as a sacrifice.   Some other blemishes disqualify a person from the service but do not disqualify an animal as a sacrifice.  And some other blemishes disqualify neither a man nor an animal, and our only concern is the perception of a blemish.  Any priest that shows any of these blemishes may not serve.  Only external blemishes disqualify a person, but blemishes that are inside of his body, like a missing kidney or spleen, or a punctured intestine, even though they render him terminally ill, his service is still valid.  This is because of the verse, \"a broken leg or hand\" just as those are external, so too must all disqualifying blemishes be external.  The Sages enumerated (Rambam, Laws of Biat Mikdash 7:8) 50 blemishes that disqualify both people and animals, 23 that are unique to animals, for a total of 73 in animals.  There are also 90 blemishes that are unique to people, for a total of 143 blemishes in people.  The categories of the 90 that are unique to people are as follow: eight in the head; two in the neck; four in the ears; five in the  shoulders; four in the eye lids; eleven in the eyes; six in the nose; three in the lips; three in the abdomen; three in the back; six in the hands; four in the genitals; fifteen in the thighs and legs; four in the general form of the body; eight in the skin tone.  Four more significant blemishes apply to people that are not external, and these are: deaf-mute; mental retardation; malnutrition (even temporary); and a person who produces a foul odor (even if the timing is predictable).  In addition to these there are two more that present problems of public perception, and these are: One whose eyelashes have fallen off, even though a meaningful amount remains at the root, and one who removed his teeth.", 
            "These are the categories of the fifty disqualifying blemishes that apply to people and animals: five in the ear; three in the eyelid, and these three are included in the term 'gouged' that is used in the Torah; eight in the eye; three in the nose; six in the mouth; twelve in the genitals; six in the arms and legs; four that can be anywhere on the body, and these are the 'eczema' that is mention in the Torah, a protrusion that has a bony form, and this is the 'boil' of the Torah, one who has even a small Egyptian coloring, which is the 'yalefet' mentioned in the Torah,  and any bone that displays a crack, which is the 'harutz' mentioned in the Torah. Ribs are not considered viewable bones.  There are three more: an old individual who shakes when standing; a sick one who trembles because of weakness (though terminal illness is only a disqualifier of animals, as is birth by Caesarian); a repulsive one.  That totals fifty.  More details are found in the seventh chapter of Tractate Bechorot.", 
            "The mitzvah applied to priests when the Temple stood, and one who transgressed this prohibition and served with a blemish, if the blemish would also disqualify an animal, whether the service was performed inadvertently or deliberately, it is invalid, and he is flogged if he acted deliberately.  They also said in the Sifra (Emor 3:11): A blemished [priest] is not punished with death; he has only transgressed a negative prohibition.  If the blemish was one of the ninety that are unique to people, even though he is flogged, the service is still valid.  If the blemish was one that is only perceived as problematic he is not flogged and his service is valid."

What is also called a gift?  These are the first fruits, as Those of Blessed Memory (TOBM) derive from the tradition (Talmud, Pesachim 36b), \"'And the gist of your hand' (Deuteronomy 12:17), there are the first fruits.\"",

            "The laws of the mitzvah include:  The statement of TOBM (Talmud, Gittin 12b) that a runaway slave of a priest does eat the teruma, becasue he is still his acquired property.  Also, a rebellious wife may eat, and any wife of a priest may eat, even if she is only three years and one day old.  Also, the betrothed bride of a priest would have been eligible to eat, but the Sages decreed that she may not until they are fully married, as is explained in the beginning of the fifth chapter of Ketubot (Talmud Ketubot 57b).  A Hebrew servant does not eat, because the Torah forbids both the perennial worker and the annual worker, as it is written, \"The boarder of a priest and his worker may not eat the sacred\" (Leviticus 22:10).  But a non-Jewish slave does eat, because he is his acquired property.  Also, if the slave acquires other slaves they may eat because of his rights. This is because implicit in the expression, \"when he acquires with an acquisition\" (Leviticus 22:11), that the acquired is acquiring.  If, however, the second-tier slave acquires a third-tier slave, that slave may not eat, because it is 'when the soul acquires,' the Torah allows only one level of acquisition.  Any priestess who had relations with someone who disqualifies from the priesthood is permanently forbidden from eating teruma (Talmud, Yebamot 65a).  The same is true for an androgynous priest, whether the androgynous individual filled the role of the male or the female in the relations.  Even a strecher, that is a person who stretched his foreskin so that he would appear uncircumcised is rabinically proscribed from eating until he receives a second circumcision (Talmud, Yebamot 72a).  Many other details are explained in Tractate Terumot.",

That is, when the Land of Israel is settled, for then the obligation of teruma exist biblically, as we will, with the help of HaShem, write in Seder Shoftim (Sefer HaChinukh, 507) on the mitzvah of separating the main teruma.  In the present time the prohibition applies rabbinically to produce that is grown in Israel, as we will write there.  One who transgressed and ate teruma and is a non-priest, or even if he or she is a priest who was demoted from the priesthood through one of the mechanisms of demotion that have been taught to us by our Sages OBM, is punished with death from above, and is explained in the ninth chapter of Sanhedrin (Talmud, Sanhedrin 83b) from the verse, \"They shall die through it because they have profaned it\" (Leviticus 22:9), and after that is written, \"Any stranger should not eat the sacred.\""

If HaShem is concerned for them they should endure eternally, because His concern for things is itself their sustenance.  Therefore no species should ever be annihilated from the Earth.  Even though He is concerned for the human species as individuals (as I explained earlier in Parshat Tazria (Sefer HaChinuck, 169))  this is not the case for other species.  For them His concern is for the species as a whole, and we are therefore forbidden from destroying the tree and its offshoots at once, to hint to this.  We can also explain simply that this inspires compassion within us and distances us from cruelty (which is a bad trait).  Therefore, even though we are permitted to use animals to sustain us we are forbidden from slaughtering the parent and offspring on one day, to instill the characteristic of compassion within our souls.",

The times are: the eve of the lat day of Sukkot; the eve of the first day of Passover; the eve of Shavuot; and the eve of Rosh HaShanna.  According to rabbi Yosi HaGalili the same applies to the even of Yom Kippur in the Galil.  The obligation to inform rests exclusively on the seller; the buyer need not ask because there is a double doubt.  He does not know if the animal's mother is still living, and even if it is, he does not know if it was sold for slaughter;  They also said (Talmud, Chullin 82a) that if two people buy an animal and its offspring the one who made the first purchase has first rights to slaughter, but if the second broke the rule and did slaughter first, the first one may still not slaughter.  There is also the law of slaughtering a cow and two of her offspring or two offspring and then the cow, and the law of slaughtering her and her 'daughter' and her 'granddaughter'.  It is permitted to slaughter the 'grandmother' and 'granddaughter', because the Torah only forbids \"it and its offspring.\"",

            "They also said (Talmud, Chullin 78b) that the prohibition only applies to mother animals because the Torah says 'its offspring', meaning the one who the offspring is attached to, and that is the mother.  Neverhteless, the Talmud concludes (Talmud, Chullin 79a, according to the proper understanding) that if we conclusively know that this is the father it may not be slaughtered on the same day as the offspring, because the law follows Rabbi Yehuda.  Rabbi Yehuda seems to be uncertain if we concern ourselves with the male parentage, because he says that a mule may not be mated with a horse or a donkey, but only with another mule.  If he truly believed that the male parentage is not followed he would not have said that, instead he would have said the mule may be mated with another mule that shares a maternal type.  Instead he is in doubt, and when he said that we do not concern ourselves with paternity he meant that we cannot be lenient on that basis, but we must be strict when relevant.   In any place that a stringency will result from ignoring paternity, then we ignore it, because it is a case of doubt so we must be strict in every place.  In light of this I say that if we conclusively know the identity of the father we should be concerned for \"it and its offspring.\"  More details are explained in the eighth chapter of Tractate Chullin.",

            "We must not do anything that profanes the Name of Heaven between one person and his fellow - It is forbidden to profane the Blessed Name, which is the opposite of sanctifying the Name which we are commanded (as we will write in the following mitzvah) as it is written, \"Do not profane My holy Name\" (Leviticus 22:32).  The editor wrote in the name of Maimonides (Sefer HaMitzvot, Negative Precept #63) that this sin has three components, two of which are on the public on one pertains to the individual.  The first is in any case that one is asked to transgress one of the mitzvot during a time of persecution, and the enforcer intends for this to be a transgression, whether the mitzvah is severe or nor, or if one is asked to transgress idolatry, sexual impropriety, or murder even during a non-persecutory time, he must give his life and be killed rather than transgressing.  If he transgressed and did not die he has profraned the Name in public, and he has violated this commandment, and his sin is very serious.  Nevertheless he is not flogged as he was coerced, and the court can only enforce corporal punishment for deliberate transgression, where there are witnesses and warning.  The Sifra (Kedoshim 4:13) says, on the verse \"If one gives his children to Molech, I will place My face against that person,\" That TOBM said \"That person, and not a case of coercion, nor indavertency, nor confusion.\"  I have already explained that a person who commits an act of idolatry under coerced cicumatances is not punished with kareit, and he is certainly not executed.  He has violated the prohibition against profaning the Name.", 
            "The second type is if a person commits a sin without desire or pursuit of pleasure, but his action is intended to infuriate [God].  This is also profaning the Name and he is flogged, and this is why it says, \"And do not swear falsely in My name and profane the Name of your Lord.\"  In this case the person shows his anger with this thing where there is not physical pleasure in it.  The compoment which addresses the individual is if a person who is well known as a kind person who acts well and commits one misdeed, something that is unfitting for a person of pious character, even if it is a permissible act, he has profaned the Name.  This is what the TOBM said (Talmud, Yoma 86a), \"What is profaning the Name?  If I were to purchase meat from the butcher and not pay immediately.  Another rabbi said, 'If I were to walk four paces without teffilin and without words of Torah.'\"   This prohibition is repeated elsewhere in the verse, \"Do not profane the Name of your Lord, I am HaShem.\"",

            "The command to sanctify the Name - We are commanded to sanctify the Name as it is written, \"And I will be sanctified in the midst of the Children of Israel\" (Leviticus 22:32).  Thsi measn that one must surrender his life to preserve the religion.  TOBM have already explained based on tradition and textual exegesis when this applies.  Even though the Torah says, \"and you shall live by them\" which implies that you should not die for them, they have alreasy received that this is not universally applicable.  Through the tradition we live for all matters in the Torah.  They explicitly said (Talmud Sanhedrin 74a) that three mitzvot always require martyrdom, and these include idolatry and any of it's subcategories.  This means anything that is prohibited on the strength of it's unique restrictions, as we will soon explain.  Also, sexual impropriety and subcategories, as wella as murder.  Is a person demands that he worship idols or be killed, he should be killed and not worship, even though his heart will remain treu and faithful to HaShem.  He still must die and not commit this evil act and allow the assailant ot believe that he has denied HaShem.  The Sifra says (Sifra Emor 8:6), \"For this reason I took you out of Egypt, so that you will publicly sanctify My name.\"  The same is true for the other two - he must die and not transgress.", 
            "The root of the mitzvah - It is known that Man was only created to serve his Creator.  One who does not sacrifice his body in the service of his master is not a good servant.  Since people do give their lives for their masters we must certainly be willing to do so for the commands of the King of kings, The Holy One Blessed Be He.", 
            "From the laws of the mitzvah - TOBM said that for these three that we mentioned, a person must always give his life, whether it is a time of persecution or not, whether in public or private, whether the coercer intends to force a religious change or for his own benefit.  For other sins, however, if there is no persecution and it is in private he should transgress and not be killed, even if the intent is religious coercion.  If it is public, that is in the presence of ten Jews, if it is for the coercers benefit, he should transgress.  If it is religious coercion he should be killed.  If there is persecution, even in private and even for his benefit, even for a trivial mitzvah he should be killed. A trivial mitzvah is like what TOBM said, \"even a shoe lace,\" which means a Jew should not wear his shoes in the idolatrous fashion, because he should not look like an idolater.  This is a subcategory of idolatry, anything that is prohibited by a unique prohibition is the field of idolatry, like that TOBM said (Talmud, Pesachim 25a), \"One who is in peril may be healed by anything except for asheira wood.\"  The Yerushalmi said on this (Jerusalem Talmud Shabbat 14:4) that is not only if the doctor says, \"bring me those asheira branches\" which would then seem like deifying it.  It even applies is he says, \"bring some leaves of that tree\" and they can only find the asheira, martyrdom is still required.  Even though when he is healed in this case it is not truly idolatry, for he did not worship it, it is still prohibited because of the prohibition of \"keep nothing of the banned in your hand\" (Deuteronomy 13:18), which is a unique prohibition in the category of idolatry.  But the many restrictions that apply to idolatry that are learned from \"do not place a stumAbling block before the blind\" are not considered a subcategory of idolatry for the purpose of martyrdom, because that prohibition is not unique to idolatry, as it applies to every mitzvah", 
            "After I wrote this I found in some of the novellae of my teaceher (may HaShem protect him) that from the Yerushalmi (Jerusalem Talmud, Avodah Zara 2:2) it seems that if the doctor does not specify [asheira] he should transgress and not die.", 
            "The idea of murder is derived by TOBM from reason, and they said by way of parable, \"What do you see that your blood id redder?  Perhaps the blood of that man is redder.\"  That is, the murdered might be capable of performing more mitzvot than the murderer, and therefore logic dictates that no one can kill anyone else, even if the consequence is death.  They also said, (Jerualem Talmud, Terumot 8:4) that even if there were several thousand Jews and the coercers asked for one of them, or if they should refuse, everyone will be killed, they must all be killed and not give up any Jewish life.  This only applies if they do not specify a person, but if they expressly ask for some individual they may give him over, as in the well known story of Sheva ben Bichri. This is also  the case if they ask for a woman [to rape] as we see in Terumot (Mishnah, Terumot 8:12).", 
            "The idea of sexual impropriety is derived from a connection between the betrothed maiden and murder, and just as murder demands martyrdom, so too a person must doe and not debase a betrothed maiden.  the Torah does not simply tell stories if we cannot learn from them.  They also had support from their tradition which is an iron wall for all that they say.  The early authorities wrote that we only say a person must die rather than sin, but to failing to perform a mitzvah doe not demand martyrdom, as TOBM said about Esther, that she was like still ground.  She was passive and she was raped, and even is the woman assisted in the intercourse midway, she is excused because lust overtook her, and this is the greatest coercion there is.  That we find that the ancient pious ones were killed even for the sake of a mitzvah like TOBM said (Mechilta, Shemot 20:6), \"Why are you being stoned?  Because I circumcised my son.  Why are you being hanged?  Because I shook the lulav.\"  That was an extra measure of piety that they saw was needed in their generation.  Those great sages were qualified to make that judgment.  Otherwise they would not have been permitted to die, becasue not everyone can allow himslef to be killed for other matters than those that were specified by TOBM.  Moreover, they would be held repsonsible for the loss of their lives (Rambam, Yesodei HaTorah 5:4).", 
            "I have also seen in the works of my teacher, that any woman who can be betorhted, such as a widow to the High Priest, or a divorcee to a priest, or a mamzer to a Jew/Jewess, all these cases are not considered improprieties such that one must die for them.  Still, we would not advise anyone to have intercourse with any woman, even if she is single.  He should instead die from the illness that has come from his passion, not cohabit or even speak with her, as we see in Sanhedrin (Talmud, Sanhedrin 75a) and the Book of Madda (Rambam, Yesodei HaTorah 5:9).  More details are explained int he 8th chapter of Sanhedrin and the Peachim, Yoma and elsewhere.", 
            "The miztvah always applies to men and women.  One who transgressed and did not sanctify the Name in a circumstance where he was obligated to do so, has failed to fulfill this mitzvah, and he has also violated the prohition against profaning the Name, as I have already written (Sefer HaChinukh 295).  The sin of profaning the Name is very severe to the point that TOBM said that repentance, Yom Kippur, and afflicitons are not sufficient to atone, only death, as we see in the last chapter of Yoma (Talmud, Yoma 86a)."

They also said there (Talmud, Rosh HaShannah 16a) that on this day the inhabitants of the world are judged for their deeds.

He is abundantly kind and skews toward kindness, and since the sins are [relatively] few, He forgives them. If there are perhaps sins that require expiation, they will be retributed in small pieces.  This is like what the Sages said, \"For His loved ones he retributes in small pieces.\" (Talmud, Avodah Zarah 4a)  If He did not remember them for a longer period they would become so abundant that the whole world would be deserving of destruction, God forbid.",

On the side that it is the day of judgement for all living things it is proper to stand in more fear on this day than the other holidays of the year.  This is the concept of 'recalling the shofar sound' that is mentioned in connection with this day, because the shofar sound is a broken sound, and it hints to the need for each person to break his evil inclination and regret his evil deeds, as I will explain at length on the mitzvah of Shofar (Sefer HaChinukh : Mitzvah 405), with HaShem's help.  It is for this reason that the Sages did not establish the recitation of Hallel on this holiday, as they said, \"It is not proper for a person to sing songs of praise while he stands in judgement.\"  Rabbi Abahu also said in the final chapter of Rosh HaShanna (Talmud, Rosh HaShannah 32b), \"The ministering angels said the HaShem, 'why do the people of Israel not say Hallel on Rosh HaShanna and Yom Kippur? et al.\" as you will find there.",

The idea of changing a name seems to be that a person should think of himself as if he is someone else (Mishnah Torah, Laws of Repentance 2:4) and improve all of his ways.  Thus anytime he is called he will remember this change and pay attention to it.  They also said that three books are opened on Rosh HaShanna, one for the truly righteous, one for the truly wicked, and one for the people in between.  The idea of opening books seems to be a parable to describe the attentiveness that HaShem has to people.  The Sages always used familiar expressions to allow their ideas to penetrate the ears of the listener.  The righteous are immediately written and sealed for life. (My teacher explained that 'truly righteous' in this instance means 'totally innocent', and 'truly wicked' means 'totally guilty') [The wicked are] therefore sealed immediately for death, since they have no merits to protect them.  [The judgement of] those in between are left suspended until Yom Kippur, at which time a final verdict is sealed.  They also said (in close proximity to the preceding), \"Beit Shammai said, 'there are three groups of people on the Day of Judgement (meaning after death of each person, which is called the Day of Judgement): the truly righteous, the truly wicked, and those in between.  Here they explain that 'truly righteous' and 'truly wicked' reflect the result of the judgement, which resolves any great questions about the issue.

We were therefore commanded to fast on this day, as food and drink, as well as other bodily pleasures, propel the physical matter toward desire and sin, and they cause people to lose the form of the wise soul that seeks truth, which is the service of HaShem and His lessons which are good and sweet for anyone with knowledge."

It must be at least 7x7 hand-breadths; less than that is invalid.  It needs three walls, and a doorway that it formed by two vertical posts and one on top of them.  The law requires that it have more shade than sun, and if it does not it is invalid.  If one makes a thick house-style roof it is valid. The law is that one may build his Sukka between trees and allow the trees to serve as walls, and one may build a Sukka on a wagon or a boat.  The law is that one may cover over a porch that has door-frames, whether they are onside or outside.  The roof must be made of something that is not susceptible to ritual impurity, such as the leftover stalks and bramble, but not from something that is susceptible to ritual impurity.  The law also considers a case where invalid cover is placed in the middle or on the side.  The law is that three [hand-breadths] of airspace invalidates the covering,  whether it is in the middle or on the side in a small Sukka.  The law is that placing a sheet over the Sukka because of the sun or below [the cover] because falling detritus invalidates it.  If they are hung for beauty it is valid, as anything that beautifies the Sukka is valid.", 
            "The law addresses a  Sukka above another Sukka, The law is that one who sleeps in a canopy in the Sukka may not do so if the roof is even one hand-breadth wide, though he may if it is less.  The law is that if one sleeps under a bed in the Sukka, if the bed is higher than ten hand-breadths he may not do so, but if it is not he may.  Even though [sleeping under] a canopy is forbidden if it less than ten hand-breadths, the bed is different because it is primarily intended to be used as a platform.  If one placed a sheet on two poles he  may sleep underneath it as it has no roof, and it is like making space by supporting it under his arms, which is obviously permitted.  The law is that a stolen Sukka is valid, as land cannot be stolen.  Even if one stole wood and made a Sukka out of them it is valid, as the Sages passed an edict that he is only repsobsible to pay for the wood.  The law is that one who is suffering is exempted from Sukka, for the Torah said 'you shall sit' [which is understood to mean] as you live.  Certainly an ill person is exempted for this reason, and even his nurses are exempted.  Similarly, anyone who is an emissary to perform a mitzvah, and also the bride-groom and his clique, as they are performing a mitzvah.  The law also addresses travelers and watchmen for gardens and orchards, and city watchmen, and rain falling, and the Sukkot of GNB\"Kh and RQB\"Sh, that are valid.  The law is that the wood used to build the Sukka is biblically prohibited for any other use for all seven days, and on the 8th and 9th day in the Diapsora they are forbidden because they are considered set aside.  The decorations of the Sukka are forbidden because of it would degrade the mitzvah to use them, so it is said in the name of Nachmanides (Michamot, Beitzah 4:5).

Even though there are other mitzvot in this regard as we have said above (Sefer HaChinukh : Mitzvah 58), like the command to judge claims and torts, etc., and sales are certainly a subset of claims, it was still necessary to add a unique mitzvah pertaining to sales as this is an everyday issue that people must deal with every day for their livelihood.

Also, Shabbat is repeated 22 times but some activities, such as kindling and carrying, are still  singled out.

            "The laws of the mitzvah include what the Sages said (Talmud, Kiddushin 26a-28b) that the laws depend in what is being bought and sold.  Land and slaves can be bought with money, a contract, or possession, and the many details of each of these are described in the first chapter of Kiddushin.  Movable properties are acquired though other means such as lifting (see Talmud, Baba Batra 76b), which is the most effective form and works for all movable properties.  Some can be acquired through a lower level acquisition and this is dragging it, and some can be purchased though a still lower level, and this is the handng of the reins.  The Sages proved that (Talmud Baba Metziah 47b)  movable property cannot be acquired though the same means as land from the verse (Lev 25:14) \"Or purchased from you fellow's hand.\"  They explained based on the tradition that this refers to objects must be transferred from one hand to another.  They also brought proofs that land can be purchased in the ways described from other verses. ", 
            "There is no doubt that all of these methods are rabbinic enactments and the verses are used to support their words.  The truth is that their dear wisdom that they would eventually come to realize was hidden and stored in the verses, and even though the primary verses are not intended to teach these laws.  The Sages also said that on a Torah level money is effective even for movable properties, but the the reason they required dragging the item was as a safeguard to avoid the seller saying \"your wheat burnt in the loft.\"  Because of this enactment the Sages said that (Baba Metzia 49b) if the object was in the buyers possession, even if he rented the space to the seller, since the domain is the buyer's and he is always attentive to the state of the object, if something should happen to the object he could recognize the risk rescue it as the seller could, in this case the sale is enacted only through money as the Torah prescribed, and not through dragging it.  Also, i the buyer rents the place that the object is located, dragging et al become ineffective.   The Sages said (Talmud, Baba Batra 85b) that just as a a person's person can acquire for him, so too his belongings can acquire for him in any place that he may leave them.  Once the object is placed inside a vessel neither can retract; it is as if it was lifted or placed inside his house.  In a place where the buyer may not place his vessel, his vessel will not acquire for him, such as the seller's property, or the public domain.  Nevertheless, the Sages said that in the seller's domain if the seller says, \"acquire with this vessel\" or even if he doesn't say it but the buyer acquired another vessel by lifting it and then placed the produce intended for purchase into the vessel, he has immediately acquired the produce.  The pleasure that the seller receives from the sale of the vessel causes him to forgive the place that it sits, and it is as if the vessel is in the buyer's domain.", 
            "Handing over the object works differently, and it is only effective in a public domain or a space that belongs to neither of them (Talmud, Baba Batra 76b).  This method is used for objects that are too large to be lifted or even dragged, such as a large ship that requires an enormous undertaking and a large number of people to move.", 
            "Dragging is also different, as it only acquires on a sidewalk, which is the area adjacent to the side of the public domain, where people commonly leave their vessels.  Any vessels left in such a place may not be moved by another person.  Dragging also acquires in a yard that belongs to both of them, and lifting is effective in all places, as he is lifting the object, and his person can acquire because his body is his domain in all places.", 
            "There is another method of acquisition on a Torah level which is called 'exchange', which was the old method in Israel.  It is essentially a trade of an object for an object, or an object for land, and the Sages said (Mishnah Torah, Laws of Sales 5:5) that once the first party dragged the object the be exchanged, the other object is acquired wherever it may be.  If anything then destroys the object, the loss is absorbed by the purchaser.  Barter only works for vessels and not produce, as produce cannot be used (Talmud, Baba Batra 47a) as implied in the verse, (Rut 4:7) \"And this was the early custom in Israel, a man would remove his shoe.\"  Nevertheless, even though produce cannot be the medium of barter, produce can be acquired through barter, i.e., a person can use a vessel to acquire produce through barter wherever they may be.  The same is not true of coins, which can neither be bartered for or with, because people always think about the face value and it may be devalued by governmental action.  Thus, it is not of constant predictable value and people do not have faith to acquire with it, and it cannot be used for barter.  A coin without face value can be used for barter like any other object.  This is a coin that is no longer in circulation as Reish Lakish said, \"even a purse filled with coins\" which Rabbi Abba understood to refer to coins that were cancelled by the Emperor or the Governor.   ", 
            "When we say that something is not used as barter it does not mean that the sale is annulled and the intended some need not be paid, for he is certainly obliged to pay in full for whatever he has purchased, since he dragged the produce.  "

That is the view of Maimonides (Mishnah Torah, Laws of Shemitta and Yovel 11:1).

Nachmanides explained it differently, and that is that the lnad cannot be sold to non-Jews, that is, we may not sell to them as a permanent sale.  He explained the verse to mean that we may not sell the land to one who will hold it forever, and that is a non-Jew.  It cannot apply to a Jew because he will return it.  If he stipulated that the non-Jew must return the land it is permitted to sell it to him.",

We said above that in that case both parties have transgressed this law and their action is ineffective, as one may not make conditions that violate the Torah and the Torah said that the land cannot be sold permanently.  If, however, a number of years is mentioned it is not permanent.  The Sages may have derived this from the wording of \"not permanent\" as opposed to \"only until the Jubilee\" which implies that anything other than a permanent sale does not return in the Jubilee.", 
            "Nachmanides explicitly wrote that (commentary on Makkot, 3b) that if one stipulates that the field will  not return in the Jubilee the condition doe not stand and the field does return.  The same is not true for the Sabbatical year, where if one loans on the condition that it will not be cancelled by the Sabbatical the condition does stand, as this relates to money.  He explained that regarding the cancellation of debts the Torah only prohiibitied the activity of the lender, as it says \"Every creditor should cancel all that his fellow owes him\" (Deut. 15:2).  The borrower, however, retains the right to repay if he so desires.  In the context of the Jubilee both the seller and the buyer are included, as we have written, the Torah says \"shall not be sold\" to both of them, as the land belongs to HaShem, and no person has the right to sell it permanently.  Therefore, neither has the authority to forgive the rule, and land is forcibly returned to the ancestral owner, even if they make a thousand conditions that it should not return.  This is a good reason.", 
            "Also in the laws of the mitzvah is the Sages statement (Talmud, Arachin 30a) that if one sells an ancestral field and he also owns other lands, that is, land that he purchased or receives as a gift, and then he sells those fields to redeem his ancestral land, he is not heeded.  The Torah says, \"and he finds enough to redeem\" implying that he did not have it at the time of the sale.  Similarly, if he borrowed and wished to redeem with those funds he is not heeded, as it says \"his hand reached\" and not that he borrowed.",

These are called the ancestral fields, and their laws differ from other lands for the purposes of redeeming.  Ancestral land can be redeemed by the seller or another redeemer after two years without the consent of the buyer.  Other fields, which are called purchased lands, can only be redeemed with the buyers consent, or else they stay with the buyer until the Jubilee.", 
            "Houses differ from fields.  We will write later (Sefer Hachinuch 340) that they can also be redeemed without the buyers consent, as it says, \"it shall be redeemed\", but they can be redeemed even in the first year, like houses in a walled city.  Those laws are also explained in the Torah.",

They also said (Talmud, Arachin 29b) that if one sells his field, whether it is ancestral land or purchased land, he may not redeem it for two years, even with the permission of the buyer, as the Torah commands that it stay with the buyer for two years in the verse \"for two harvests it is sold to him.\"  That is directed to the seller; the buyer is included in the verse, \"for a number of years it is acquired\", which must be at least two.  It seems that the idea is that any sale of land must be an act of distress, and a person should not think that he can sell his land and redeem it immediately. He should know that there will be at least two years from the time of the sale that he will miss.  The Sages also said that the buyer must receive two years of harvest from the land, and if one of his years is a year of drought and disease, or a Sabbatical year, it does not count.  [A lean year, however, is counted.]  If he sold it in the Jubilee itself, the sale is invalid, and the money is returned.  If he sold just the trees, they may not be redeemed for two years, and if they are not redeemed they are not returned in the Jubilee, and it says, \"he will return to his portion\" and not to trees.  If he sold it to A and A sold to B and B to C, even if there are 100 buyers, the field returns to the original owner at the Jubilee, as it is written (Lev 27:24) \"to he who is the inheritor of the land.\"  Other details are explained in Tractate Arachin.",

This is true if they performed some deed, as one cannot be flogged unless there is a deed.  This is the view of Maimonides.

The Torah also commanded that each city be surrounded by 1000 cubits of meadow (area that provides opportunity for leisure and aesthetic to the city), and 2000 cubits beyond that for fields and vineyards, which also has aesthetic value for the city and provides some of its needs (see Talmud, Sotah 27b).  This law teaches that those states can never be altered, and concerning this it says, \"The fields, meadows and cities shall not be sold.\" We understand the word 'sold' in this context to mean 'altered', for if it were addressing actual sales it would be contradictory as the verse explicitly says that the Levites can always redeem their lands from a buyer, which implies that they may sell them.",

They do not wage war like the remainder of the Jewish people, nor do they receive an inheritance, nor do they acquire for themselves through their physical power.

This may be an application of the Sages' concept of \"the Torah speaks in a human voice\" (Talmud, Berakhot 31b); the Torah repeats transgressions that require more vigilance, just as people will repeat themselves and use enhanced language to indicate the severity of an issue so that the listener is vigilant about it.  Though a person should be most careful about the words of HaShem even if they are communicated through the slightest hint, in His great kindness He repeated some commands many times as a parent teaches a child, and we should therefore thank him for all the goodness that he bestows upon us.", 
            "From the root of the mitzvah: I have written about it in the prohibition for the guarantor, witnesses and scribe that forbids their involvement is usurious loans (Sefer HaChinukh 68).  ", 
            "The laws of the mitzvah, such as the distinctions that the Sages taught us between interest that is prohibited from the Torah, which they call (Talmud, Bava Metziah 61b) 'definite usury'.  Other forms are rabbinically prohibited, which the Sages called 'the dust of usury'.  There is also another level which is lower than these first two, and this is really permitted as it is far removed from Torah level interest and is not suited for an edict, but the Sages were very strict in this matter for they saw that the Torah is very strict on it.  They passed these restrictions so that a person would not try to work around the law, and not for some other reason.  [Returning to] the three types of interest: Torah level interest describes a case in which a person says to his fellow, \"lend me a manah and I will give you a peruta every day\" or 30 perutas a month, or some other amount, until I pay you back.  Or if he says, \"lend me 100 dinar and i will pay you back 120 after a year,\" or if he lends money and takes a house or courtyard as collateral with the stipulation that he will hold the land and reap the benefit of the produce until the loan is repaid, without subtracting something from the repayment amount, this is definite usury and is prohibited from the Torah.  The general rule is explained by the Sages as \"any case of payment for the time [that the money is kept] is prohibited from the Torah\" (Talmud, Bava Metziah 63b), if the money comes from the borrower to the lender.  In this case the Sages said, \"Definite usury can be extracted by the court\" (Talmud, Bava Metziah 61b). That is, the court may seize assets from the borrower, as is the law for theft and torts.  Others explain that the court is licensed to physically coerce the lender, as is customarily done to someone who refuses to fulfill a positive mitzvah.", 
            "Every other form of interest (aside from those mentioned) are called Rabbinic usury or 'the dust of usury', and they money cannot be retrieved by the court.  The Sages prohibited these as a safeguard lest a person come to transgress the biblical prohibition.  Some forms are like the Sages rule (Talmud, Bava Metziah 70b) that one cannot accept an investment with a guaranteed return of principle from a Jew, nor may deals be priced with produce before it is evaluated (though if the value is established it may be used, for even though the buyer may not possess the produce, someone else does).  This only applies if the buyer does not possess the produce; if he does possess some, even a small amount, he may use it before the price is set.  For instance, he may price out several Se'ah even if he only possesses one, as the law follows Shmuel who took this position in the Talmud (Talmud, Bava Metziah 75a).  When we say that he must have the same type, some hold that it must be exactly the same (Beit Yosef, Yoreh De'ah 175), e.g. he may not set the price in new wheat if he only has old.  Others hold that we do not make a distinction between old and new, anything within the same type is sufficient.  Nevertheless, if he does possess the type, he may price with it even if it is some preparatory steps removed form the relevant product, but if it is more than three steps it is considered something else entirely.  The Talmud (Talmud, Bava Metziah 74a) elaborates on the various steps involved in preparing wheat, as well as manufacturing tools and other things.", 
            "The mitzvah also includes the prohibition against lending with land as a collateral, such that if the money is not returned by such and such a day the land will belong to the lender (Talmud, Bava Metziah 66a), because the acquisition is not binding as it is not performed with certainty.  That is, a person made the assumption that the money would be returned on time and he was not able to fulfill his intention; this is akin to an accident.  In any similar case it is forbidden to reap the benefit because it is interest.  The Talmud provides many examples of uncertain arrangements in matters of interest and other areas.  My teacher (may HaShem guard him) taught us that any punitive condition, that is, if it is not fulfilled a financial penalty will  be applied, is called uncertain, and concerning this the Sages said \"uncertain arrangements are not binding.\"  Another expression they use is \"any 'if not' is not binding.\"  Any condition, however, that a person makes with his fellow in the form of \"if you do such and such, I will do such and such,\" as people commonly create conditions, is not uncertain, for if it were how could we ever make conditional arrangements (as they all must be dependent on 'if' statements).  Moreover, what could we say about the many conditions that pertain to marriage and divorce?  They are all 'if' statements!  Rather, it must be as we said, that only punitive conditions are considered uncertain, such as \"if I don't pay you by day X the field will be yours,\" or whatever the collateral is, but not for the great many other conditions that people stipulate, such as \"if you go to place X I will give you sum Y,\" or \"If you do X for me I will give you 200 zuz\" etc.  Understand this, my son, give heart to it, and through this a heavy fog will be lifted from before your eyes in many issues in the Talmud.", 
            "They also said (Tamud, Bava Metziah 75b) that early or late interest is prohibited.  What does this mean?  If a person decided that he wanted to borrow money from someone and sent him gifts to encourage him to lend, this is early interest.  If he borrowed and returned the money, and then sent gifts in recognition of the fact that his money was idle, this is late interest.  Some authorities also said (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Creditor and Debtor 6:7) that if one lends money to his fellow with land that constantly produces value (like a courtyard, bathhouse or market stall), if it is done withut a discount it is genuine usury, and if there si a discount it is 'dust of usury'.  But if the loan is made with the land that does not constantly produce value (like a field or vineyard, as sometimes the expense involved exceeds the revenues) without a discount it is not usury, and with a discount it is permitted.  Other authorities say that the Sages even prohibited this latter case, and the only permissible form of collateral is the Syrian style, in which they would write, \"at the end of these years the land will transfer without funds.\"  In truth it seemed from the Talmud to our teachers (HaShem should keep them) according to the best explanations, that any collateral that is made with a discount, whether it is a house or bathhouse that produces profits, or a field or vineyard, it is all permitted with a discount.  This is the custom in our regions based on their words, and one who is concerned for the view of the great sages who were strict in this matter will be blessed from heaven. ...", 
            "What was prohibited by the Sages to avoid creating ruses?  If a person says to his fellow, \"lend me a manah [=100 zuz]\" and the other responds, \"I have no manah, but I have a manah worth of wheat.\"  If he then gives him the wheat and buys them back for 90, this would certainly be legal, but the Sages forbade it because it allows for a ruse of interest.  It is apparent that this is like usury, as this one gave 90 but will receive 100 in return, but if it was already done the court would extract the full 100, as this is not even the 'dust of interest'; it is only prohibited as a safeguard.  Also, if one had a field as collateral he may not rent it to its owner as this is also a ruse.  Similar cases are described in the Talmud (Talmud, Bava Metziah 68a).  Even though these are only forbidden as ruses, some other activities are permitted even though they seem like genuine usury.  The Sages permitted them because they could not lead to other transgressions.  For example, a person may sell debt at a discount, and he may also pay an agent to procure a loan from another Jew on his behalf.  The general principle is that the Torah only forbade interest that goes from the hand of the borrower to the lender.  This is because the Torah usually describes the dominant case and leaves out the details, and as the standard case is funds transferring directly from the borrower to the lender this is the command of the Torah.  Even though all this is true, any moral person should stay as far from any kind of usury ruses as possible.  Anyone who pursues vehicles to extract interest payments from another Jew will eventually see his fortune dwindle, as the Sages said, \"Anyone who deals in interest shrinks his portfolio.\"  (Talmud, Bava Metzia 71a)  They also said, \"A peruta of interest causes a loss of storehouses full of cash.\" (Talmud, Bava Metzia 75b)  Many more details are explained in the fifth chapter of Bava Metziah.", 
            "The mitzvah always applies to both men and women.  One who transgressed and loaned money with a prohibited form of interest has violated this commandment, and the money may be extracted by the court, directly from his assets, as is the law for theft and torts (according to the first view), or we may use coercive techniques to retrieve the money as is the law for one who refuses to fulfill a positive mitzvah (according to the view of my teachers).  If he loaned with a rabbinic form of 'the dust of interest' he has transgressed a rabbinic edict, but the money cannot be retrieved by the court.  If the borrower seized the interest amount from the lender we do not take it back from him.  If the interest was in the category of the ruse ,we obviously don't force the lender to return it and we even retrieve the money from the borrower if he seized it, as this was the arrangement that they agreed to.  Since this is only a stringency to avoid real situations of interest, we do not police it after the fact, which for this purpose is defined as when the conditions have been fulfilled by both parties."

            "It is forbidden to force a Hebrew slave to performing demeaning or degrading tasks, as one would a non-Jewish slave.  As it is written, \"Do not work him as a slave.\" (Lev 25:29)  The Sages said in the Sifra (Sifra, Behar 7:2) explaining this matter that, \"he should not carry your cushion (which is a small cloth the people carry to sit on if they tire, and the way of the slave is to carry his master's implements for his master), nor should he carry his bath tools into the bathhouse.\"   The Sages mentioned these, and we can learn from them for all similar activities.  It emerges that a person should be mindful of what he orders his Hebrew slave to perform, and this is part of the principle that the Sages said, \"one who acquires a Hebrew slave has acquired a master for himself.\" (Talmud, Kiddushin 22a) Nevertheless, the verse says that he will be a \"laborer and a worker with you,\" which implies that he may be ordered to perform all customary forms of work.  In general a free laborer is not employed for degrading work, nor is a migrant worker, who stays with the master and performs his work at will.  Therefor the Torah said that he should be like a worker, because these men, even though they do work, are usually not employed in slave-style labor.  Still, the slave must behave as a slave and honor his master to the best of his ability, and he should not become haughty with all that we have said.",

He should also recognize that just as this slave was sold because of his desperation, the same could happen to him, or to one of his sons (if they should be sinful), and through honoring his slave he will certainly recognize this, and through this though he will avoid sin.  Another purpose if to instill the values of kindness and compassion, and to distance us from the evil trait of cruelty, and through establishing good characters we will receive goodness, as HaShem wishes to bestow His blessings on His creations, as we have said many times before.

You should not eat refined bread if he eats coarse, nor should you drink aged wine and he unaged, nor should you sleep on pillows and he on straw.\"  They also said, (Sifra, 7:3), \"The master should not live in the town and the slave in the village, as it is written, 'he will leave you' (Lev. 25:41)\"  More details are explained in the Sifra and in Kiddushin.

Even though a woman should not acquire a slave because it leads to suspicion, she is still included in the mitzvah.  One who transgressed and forced his Hebrew slave to perform degrading work has violated this commandment, though it seems that he is not flogged as there is no deed; words are usually used to instruct a slave.  I already wrote (Sefer HaChinuch, 241) that any prohibition that can be transgressed without a deed, even if an individual did in fact perform a deed while transgressing, still does not incur flogging, as it is still termed a prohibition without a deed.  This is my clear approach to this issue."

            "We are commanded to keep a Canaanite slave in perpetuity, that is, that we should never manumit him, and he should only go free through a tooth or limb (as the verse, Ex. 21:26-27, explains).  This is the accepted explanation of the verse (Talmud, Kiddushin 24a) \"You shall work them forever.\" (Lev. 25:46)  Our Sages said (Talmud, Gittin 38a), \"Rav Yehuda said, 'Anyone who manumits his slave is in violation of a positive commandment, as it says \"You shall work them forever.\"'\"  Canaanite in this context includes any non-Jewish person who was acquired by a Jew as a slave; all slaves are attached to Canaan because he was cursed with slavery for him and his progeny.   Even though this section is clearly discussing actual Canaanites, as it says, \"from the peoples that surround you you may purchase a slave or maid-servant,\" and earlier it says, \"As I give you the Land of Canaan,\" our Sages still knew that this really applied more broadly to all people, and there are no differences in law between Canaanites and others.", 
            "Also, if a Jew has relations with a slave woman, that is, a non-Jewish woman who was purchased by a Jew, the offspring is a Canaanite slave for all purposes (Talmud, Yebamot 22a), even if the slave belongs to the man himself.  Similarly, if a non-Jew has relations with a Canaanite slave woman, the offspring is a slave, as it says, \"that are born unto you in your land.\"  If, however, one of our slaves has relations with a non-Jewish woman, the offspring is not a slave, as a slave has no paternity.  A resident alien, that is, a non-Jew who has accepted that he will not worship idols and will live in our land, who sold himself to a Jew is treated as a Canaanite slave.  Our Sages said (Talmud, Yebamot 48b) that when a Jew acquires a slave he has twelve months to convince him to abandon idolatry, get circumcised, immerse in the mikva, and accept the obligations that apply to a Jewish woman.  If he refuses, he may not stay longer than twelve months, and he must be sold immediately.  It is only those slaves that were circumcised and immersed that the commandment to 'work them forever' applies.", 
            "From the root of the mitzvah - Since the People of Israel are the choicest specimens of humanity and they were created to recognize their Creatpr and serve Him, it is fitting that they should have slaves to serve them.  If they could not find slaves among the other nations, they would they need to enslave their brethren, who would then be unable to strive in the service of HaShem.  We were therefore commanded to retain those who serve us after we have readied them and removed idolatry from their mouths , lest they be a source of strife in our homes.  This is the meaning of the verse, \"And as for your brothers, the Children of Israel, a man unto his brother shall not impose hard labor.\"  That is, if we follow this we will not need to enslave our brethren, and everyone will be able to serve HaShem.  Even though the verse also teaches that a Hebrew slave cannot be subjected to hard labor, there are many meanings in every verse.", 
            "Given that the foundation of this mitzvah is the propagation of service of the Creator, the Sages permitted non-fulfillment of this mitzvah whenever its fulfillment would interfere with another mitzvah, even if it is only a rabbinic edict, such as forming a quorum in the Synagogue (cf Talmud, Berakhot 47b).  You should not wonder how we can forsake a biblical mitzvah in favor of a rabbinic one, because the foundation of the mitzvah is only the advancement of the service of HaShem, and manumitting in this case meets that end.  Moreover, the freed individual is now capable of fulfilling more mitzvot on his own, hence the Sages said (ibid.) that is is permissible to free him, as this is what they had received. ", 
            "From the laws of the mitzvah - The Sages taught (Talmud, Kiddushin 22b) that he may acquire his freedom though payment, a writ, or an injury to a limb that will not heal (of which there are 24).  Even though he is granted freedom with such an injury we still require that the master compose a writ of manumission, and we force the master to do so after this kind of injury.  The Sages also said that (Talmud, Gittin 43b) one who sells his slave to non-Jews or Samaritans, or even to a resident alien, [effectively] frees his slave.  Also, a Jew who lives in Israel who sells his slave to another Jew who intends to take him out of Israel [effectively] frees his slave.  Similarly, the Sages taught (Talmud, Gittin 40a) that if his master marries him of to a free woman, or if he helps him don tefillin, or calls him up to read three verses before the congregation, or anything else that is only an obligation of free men, he has [effectively] freed him, and we force the master to compose a writ of manumission.  Therefore, the master must be careful to avoid doing any of these things so that he will not violate this mitzvah, unless it is done for the sake of another mitzvah (as we explained above).  The laws of the composition of the writ, as well as other details, are explained in Tractates Gittin and  Kiddushin.",

A 'bowing stone' refers to a stone that is engraved with images.  Hewn stones that have been planed smooth are also included in this prohibition.", 
            "From the root of the mitzvah - Maimonides wrote (Sefer HaMitzvot, Negative Precepts 12) that this was a form of idolatry.  They would place expertly engraved stones before the idols and they would prostrate upon them.  We might also explain that it seems like worshiping the stone itself; since the stone was prepared and beautified it arouses suspicion.  Bowing on clothing arouses no suspicion as clothing are easily destroyed and therefore unworthy of worhip, whereas a stone, which has both staying power and a corresponding angel in Heaven (as the Sages said (Talmud, Chullin 40a) \"Whether he speaks to the mountain or to 'Gada' of the Mount, which is the angel that is responsible for the mountains, he arouses suspicion.\") The Torah distances us greatly from anything that others might suspect as wrong, with the added purpose of preventing others from being misled by his actions.

            "From the laws of the mitzvah - The Sages said (Talmud, Megillah 22b) that one only incurs lashes if he spreads his arms and legs, which would then allow him to rest completely on the stone, as this is the accepted understanding of the word 'prostate' in the Torah.  If he did not spread out he is not flogged, but they would administer the 'rebel's beating.'  Within the context of actual idolatry there is no distinction between spread out and not spread; as soon as one bows his face to a foreign god he incurs the penalty of stoning Talmud, Horayot 4a).  The Sages also said (Mishnah Torah, Laws of Idolatry 6:7) that if he placed rugs on the stone and covered them, he may then prostate there.  They also said that the prohibition applies everywhere except the Temple, for in the Temple one may prostate one's self to HaShem on stones, as it says, \"do not place in your lands\" [which implies that] it is in your lands that you may not prostate, but you may prostate on the stone surfaces in the Temple.  This distinction may be understood based on the reason we have given, that people will suspect the prostrater of deifying the stones, and as the Temple is chosen for the service of HaShem, and it is as clear as day that the only worship that is performed there is directed to Him, there is no room for suspicion.  If, however, we follow Maimonides' rationale, that it is to distance us from what was an idolatrous practice, we should be even more careful in Temple to avoid corrupting the thoughts of the one who comes to prostrate himself to HaShem.  Still, I know that Maimonides had sound reasons for everything he said, and sometimes the inadequacies of the reader can confuse the matter.  More details are explained in Tractate Megillah.",

He said to him: He smiled and said, 'My sons have defeated Me...'\" - meaning that the Holy One, blessed be He, was happy that His sons walked in the way of the Torah and its commandments, to incline after the majority rule. And that which is says, \"My sons have defeated Me\", God-forbid that there is any defeat before Him, blessed be He, but the explanation is about this idea, that in the debate of Rabbi Eliezer with his colleagues, Rabbi Eliezer had the right of it, and the Bat Kol had decided like him. Even though the truth was with him because of his better explication over his colleagues who could not fathom his mind, and they did not concede to him even after the Bat Kol, and they brought a proof from the law set in the Torah that commands us to always go after the majority rule, whether they say the truth or whether they are mistaken. About this was the response of the Creator, blessed be He, \"My sons have defeated Me.\" Meaning, after they turned away from the true path, for Rabbi Eliezer had surmised the truth, and they came upon him from the power of the Torah commandments that commanded them to always listen to the majority, if so then, anyway one looks at it, this time one must concede to them as they said, [though] it lacks truth, for it is as if the \"Master of Truth\" had been defeated."

            "It is a Mitzvah to walk and resemble the ways of the Holy Blessed one - as we are commanded to perform all actions in a manner of goodness and integrity with all our strength. To turn aside all our words that are between us and beside us, it is a way of kindness and compassion, when we found out from our Torah that this is the way of God, and this is God’s desire for God’s creations, so that you merit God’s goodness, because his desire is kindness as it is written (Deuteronomy 28:9): walk in God’s ways, and God added to this in another place, as it is written (Deuteronomy 10:12, 11:22): walk in all God’s ways."
