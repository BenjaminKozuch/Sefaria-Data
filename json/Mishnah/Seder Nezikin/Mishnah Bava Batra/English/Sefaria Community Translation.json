            "Joint owners agreed to make a division in a courtyard, so they build the wall in the middle. They can build with rough stone, smooth stones, half-bricks, or bricks depending on the custom of the land. If  [the division is made of] rough-stones, each person gives three hand- breadths. If [the division is made of] smooth stones, each person gives two and a half hands-breadths. If [the division is made of] half-bricks, each person gives two hands-breadths. If [the division is made of] full bricks, each person gives one and a half handbreadths. Therefore, if the wall falls, the place where the wall and the materials were will belong to both of them.", 
            "Similarly in a garden; In a place where the custom is to build a fence, one can obligate him to build one. However, in a grain field, in a place where there isn't a custom to build a fence, one cannot obligate him. Rather, if one wants [to do so], one goes within one's own [property] and builds, and makes a sign facing outwards.  Therefore, if the wall falls, the space [where the wall stood] and the bricks belong to that person. If the wall was created according to the will of both people, they build the wall in the middle, and create a sign on both sides. Therefore, if the wall falls, the space [where the wall stood] and the bricks belong to both people:", 
            "If someone surrounds [the property of] his neighbor on three sides, and builds a fence on the first, second, and third side, he (i.e., the neighbor) is not obligated [to contribute to the cost of the fence].  R. Yose says, if [the neighbor] then builds a fence on the fourth side [of his property], we obligate him to contribute to the whole [fence].", 
            "If the wall of a courtyard falls, we obligate him to build up to four cubits. One is assumed to have given, until one brings proof that he has not given. From four cubits and up, we do not obligate him. If he built an adjacent wall, even if he did not put the ceiling above it, we make it all incumbent upon him. One is assumed not to have given, until one brings proof of having given.", 
            "We force a person to build a gatehouse and a door for the courtyard.  Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Not all courtyards are suitable for gatehouses.  We force a person to build for a city a wall, doors, and a deadbolt.  Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Not all cities are suitable for a wall.  How long must a person live in a city to be counted among the people of that city?  Twelve months.  If a person bought a house, he is immediately considered a to be a person of that city.", 
            "One may not divide a courtyard unless [it is large enough that] one person will have four cubits and the other person will have four cubits. And not a field, unless one person will have nine <i>kab</i>   [a measure of how much grain could be produced in that amount of land] and the other person will have nine <i>kab</i>. Rabbi Yehudah says: Unless one person will have nine and a half <i>kab</i> and the other person will have nine and a half <i>kab</i>. And not in a garden, unless one person will have half a <i>kab</i> and the other person will have half a <i>kab</i>. Rabbi Akiva says: A <i>beit rova</i> [a fourth of a <i>kab</i>].  And not a hall, and not a palace, and not a dovecote, and not an outer garment, and not a bathhouse, and not a oil press, unless there is a sufficient amount in [each of] them for this one person, and a sufficient amount in [each of] them for the other person. This is the general principle: Anything which may be divided and [still retain, as before] its name upon it, they may divide it. And if not, they may not divide it. When [does this apply]? When they do not both want to [divide], but when they both want to [divide], even with less than that, they may divide.  But if [the shared object is] the Holy Scriptures, even if both parties want to [divide], they may not divide. "

One must distance a dovecote from a city by fifty cubits. And one should not make a dove cote within one's own [field] unless there are fifty cubits of space in each direction.

Abba Shaul says: Every tree that does not produce fruit, [we distance] fifty cubits. If the city was there first, we cut it and do not pay. If the tree was there first, we cut it and pay. If it is unclear whether the tree or the city came first, we cut it and do not pay.",

If the cistern was there first, one may cut down the tree and give compensation. If the tree was there first, one may not cut it down. If it is in doubt if this came first or if this came first, one may not cut down the tree. Rabbi Yose says:  Even if the cistern was there before the tree one should cut it down, since this one dug within one's own domain and the other planted within one's own domain.",

If there was a fence between, this one may plant up to the fence on this side and this one may plant up to the fence on this side. If its roots entered within the other’s property, the other may cut them away to a depth of three handbreadths so that they do not hinder the plow.

            "The legal period of possession [in order to establish ownership] for houses, cisterns, trenches, caves, dovecotes, bath-houses, olive-presses, irrigated fields and slaves and anything which continually produces a yield is three complete years . The legal period of possession [in order to establish ownership] for a field irrigated by rain water is three years and they need not be completed.   Rabbi Yishmael says:  Three months during the first year, and three months during the last year and twelve months during the middle year, which makes eighteen months. Rabbi Akiva says:  One month during the first year and one month during the last year and twelve months during the middle year, which makes fourteen months. Rabbi Yishmael said:  When does this apply?  With regards to a grain field, but when it comes to a field of trees , if he brought in his produce (grapes), harvested the olives and gathered in his fig harvest, this counts as three years.   ", 
            "There are three separate areas of land for the purposes of <i>chazakah&lt;i\\&gt; [obtaining land through demonstrating ownership for an extended period of time]: Judea, The Eastern Side of the Jordan and the Galilee. If the owner of a piece of land in the Galilee was currently living in Judea and someone occupied on that person's land in the Galilee, that person would not acquire said land and vice versa.  One can only acquire the land if they are living in the same region.  Rabbi Yehuda says, the reason it takes three years to acquire land through occupying it is so that if the owner were in Spain the squatter could squat for one year, people traveling to inform the owner would take one year and then one year to return with the owner's objection. </i>", 
            "An act of possession without which there is no claim is not valid possession [to establish ownership]. How is this so? If he said to him:  “What are you doing on my property? And the other answered:  “No one ever said anything to me”, this is not valid possession [to establish ownership]. “You sold it to me”, “You gave it to me as a gift”, “Your father sold it to me”, “Your father gave it to me as a gift”, this is valid possession [to establish ownership]. One who comes due to inheritance [from the previous owner], does not need to make a claim. Craftsmen, partners, sharecroppers and guardians cannot establish ownership through possession. A man cannot establish ownership through possession of his wife’s property, nor may a wife establish ownership through possession of her husband’s property, nor a father of his son’s property, nor a son of his father’s property. When is this so? When the person attempts to acquire the land through possession. But, when the property was given as a gift, or when brothers shared a piece of their inheritance, or when one claimed title by possession to the property of a convert [who died without inheritors], then he locked up, walled up or broke down anything, behold, this is possession.", 
            "If there are two witnesses claiming that someone squatted on a piece of land for 3 years and they were found out to be false witnesses, they must pay the full value of the land the owner would have lost.  If a 2 witnesses testify about the first year, 2 about the second year and 2 about the third year, then they split the value between them.  If the witnesses were 3 brothers [who cannot testify as relatives cannot testify together], and one other witness joined them, they are considered to be 3 separate sets of witnesses but they must all be found to be false witnesses to require them to pay.

            "These are the [actions] through which possession is established and these are the action through which possession is not established.  If he put a beast in a courtyard, or an oven or stoves or mill-stones, or raised fowl or put his manure in a courtyard, this is not possession. But if he built for his beast a partition ten hand-breadths high, so too for an oven, so too for a stove, so too for a mill-stone, [or] he brought fowl inside the house, or prepared for his manure a place three hand-breadths deep or three hand-breadths high, this is possession. ", 
            "A gutter spout cannot cause title through its possession but its place does confer title through possession. A gutter can give title through possession. An Egyptian ladder cannot give title through possession but a Tyrian ladder can. An Egyptian window cannot give title through possession but a Tyrian window can. What is an Egyptian window?  One through which a man’s head may not enter. Rabbi Judah says:  If it has a frame, even though a man’s head cannot enter through it, it can give title through possession.” A projection, if it extends a handbreadth or more can give title through possession, and the other [into whose premises it projects] can protest against it. But if it is less than a handbreadth it cannot give title through possession and the other cannot protest against it. ", 
            "One may not open a window into a jointly owned courtyard. If one bought a house in another [and adjoining] courtyard, that person may not open it into a jointly held courtyard. If one built an upper story over one's house, one may not make it open into the jointly held courtyard. However, one may, if one wishes, build another room within one's house or build an upper room over one's house and make it open into one's own house. One may not open a door into a jointly held courtyard directly opposite another’s door, or a window directly opposite another’s window. If the window was small one may not make it larger; if it was a single window one may not make it into two. But one may open a door  into the public domain opposite another’s door, or a window opposite another’s window. If the window was small one may make it larger; if it was a single window one may make it into two. ", 
            "One may not hollow out a space underneath the public domain, cisterns, trenches or caves. Rabbi Eliezer permits it if it is such that a wagon loaded with stones can [safely] go over it.   One may not build out projections and balconies into the public domain; but if he wants, he may withdraw [his wall] within his own domain and build out from it. If one bought a courtyard in which were already projections and balconies, they are under that person's rights of possession. "
