            "How are witnesses [given the punishment due to] <i>zomemin</i> [scheming witnesses]?  [If witnesses said,] \"We testify that this man so-and-so is the son of a divorced woman\" or \"the son of a <i>chalutzah</i> [a women to whom levirate marriage has been declined],\" we do not say that [each scheming witness] should become the son of a divorced woman or the son of a <i>chalutzah</i> in place of [the falsely accused]. Rather, [each scheming witness] is given forty lashes. [If witnesses said,] \"We testify that this man so-and-so is liable for [a prohibition incurring] exile,\" we do not say that [each scheming witness] should be exiled in place of [the falsely accused]. Rather, [each scheming witness] is given forty lashes. [If witnesses said,] \"We testify that this man so-and-so divorced his wife and did not give her [the sum promised to her in her] <i>Ketubah</i>\"—is it not so that eventually [the accused] would have given her the [sum promised to her in her] <i>Ketubah</i>? [Therefore,] we assess how much a man would pay for this woman's <i>Ketubah</i>, given the chance that were she widowed or divorced [she would receive the money], whereas if she dies [before her husband] he inherit her [property, including the sum of the <i>Ketubah</i>]. [If witnesses said,] \"We testify that this man so-and-so owes his fellow one thousand <i>zuz</i> to be repaid within thirty days,\" and the [accused] says he must repay his loan within ten years, we assess how much one would be willing to pay to have in his hand one thousand <i>zuz</i>, [evaluating the difference] between [that quantity when the loan] is to be repaid within thirty days and [that quantity when the loan] is to be repaid within ten years. ", 
            "[Witnesses who say,] \"We testify that this man so-and-so owes his fellow two hundred <i>zuz</i>\" and are found to be <i>zomemin</i>, receive lashes and pay, for the title that brings upon [a witness] lashes does brings upon him [a requirement to make] restitution. [This is] according to Rabbi Meir. And the sages say, anyone who makes restitution does not receive lashes.", 
            "[Witnesses who say,] \"We testify that this man so-and-so is liable [for a prohibition incurring] forty lashes\" and are found to be <i>zomemin</i>, receive eighty lashes, [forty] on account of [the verse,] \"You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor,\" (Exodus 20:12), and [forty] on account of \"Then shall you do unto him, as he had purposed to do.\" (Deuteronomy 19:19) [This is] according to Rabbi Meir. And the Sages say, they only receive forty lashes. Monetary [compensation] may be divided up, but lashes cannot be divided up. How so? If they testified that one owed his fellow two hundred <i>zuz</i> and were found to be <i>zomemin</i>, they may divide up between them [the sum they owe to the one they conspired again]. But if they testified that he was liable [for a prohibition incurring] forty lashes and were found to be <i>zomemin</i>, each one of them receives forty lashes.", 
            "Witnesses are not considered <i>zomemin</i> until they themselves are incriminated How so? [If he first pair of witnesses] said, \"We testify that this man so-and-so killed a person,\" and [another pair of witnesses] say to them, \"How can you testify [to this matter], for the one killed or the one [accused of] killing was with us on that day at such-and-such a place\"—[the witnesses of the first pair] are not considered <i>zomemin</i>. But if [the second pair of witnesses] said, \"How can you testify [to this matter], for you were with us on that day at such-and-such a place\"—[the witnesses of the first pair] are considered <i>zomemin</i>, and are executed on account of [the second pair of witnesses' testimony].", 
            "If others [i.e. another pair of witnesses] come and prove [a prior pair] to be <i>zomemin</i>, and [still] others come and prove them <i>zomemin</i>, even [if this occurs] one hundred [times], all of them are executed. Rabbi Yehudah says, this is a conspiracy, and only the first group [of witnesses] is executed.", 
            "Witnesses [found to be] <i>zomemin</i> are only executed after the judgment is finished [i.e. after the verdict has been pronounced]. [This is said against the Sadducees], for the Sadducees say, [they are only executed] after the [falsely accused] has [already] been executed, for the verse says, \"a life for a life.\" The Sages said to the [Sadducees], has [the verse] not already said, (Deuteronomy 19:19): \" Then shall you do unto him, as he had purposed to do unto his brother,\" and his brother is still alive [after the verdict is pronounced, but before the falsely accused is executed]. And if so, why does [the verse] say \"a life for a life\"? It would have been possible [to maintain] that they are [liable for] execution from the moment their testimony has been accepted; [but] the verse says \"a life for a life,\" [from which we infer] that they are not killed until the judgment is finished.", 
            "(Deuteronomy 17:6) \"By the testimony of two or three witnesses [the perpetrator] shall surely be put to death.\" If two witnesses establish testimony, why did the verse specify three witnesses?  The Torah is relating three witnesses to two witnesses.  Just as a group of three witnesses can make a group of two witnesses zomemin, so too a group of two witnesses can make a group of three witnesses zomemin.  And where do we know that a group of two witnesses can make a group of one hundred witnesses zomemin?  The Torah says \"witnesses\".  Rabbi Shim'on says: Just as two witnesses are not killed until both of them become zomemin so too three witnesses are not killed until all three of them are zomemin.  And where do we know that this is the case even for one hundred witnesses?  The Torah says: \"witnesses\".  Rabbi 'Akiva says: The third witness in the group only makes the case stricter and makes his punishment like that of the others.  If so, the Torah punishes those that assist transgressors like transgressors.  All the more so, those who assist in the performance of mitzvoth will be rewarded like those that perform mitzvoth.", 
            "Just as if there were two [witnesses], and one was found to be a close relative or invalid, the entire testimony is invalidated, so too if there are three [witnesses] and one was found to be a close relative or invalid the entire testimony is invalidated. From where do we know [that this applies] even for one hundred [witnesses]?  The verse states: \"witnesses\". Rabbi Yossi said: \"What case are we talking about?  In cases of capital cases, however with monetary cases the testimony is upheld by the others.\" Rebbe said: \"The law is the same for capital cases and monetary cases.\"  And when is this?  In a case when they gave warning to [the perpetrator], however when they did not give warning what can two brothers do who saw someone killing a person?", 
            "Should two [witnesses] see [the perpetrator] from one window and two [witnesses] see him from another window and one [witness] warns him, if they have a partial view of each other they are considered as one group.  If not, they are considered as two groups.  Therefore if one pair is found guilty of perjury  [in a capital crime], both they and the  accused will be executed, and the other pair is exempt.  Rabbi Yossi says: \"They are never executed unless warned by two witnesses as it says (Deuteronomy 17:6): 'By the mouth of two witnesses.'\" Alternatively: \"By the mouth of two witnesses,\" [meaning] the court should not hear testimony in translation. ", 
            "If someone whose judgement was final, ran away but came back to the same Beit Din, we do not rip up his old judgment. Any place or time that two witnesses came and said, \"We testify that this person that had a judgement passed against him in a certain court,\" and \"Joe\" and \"Jon\" were the witnesses, we kill [the defendant on this testimony]. A Sanhedrin that would execute somebody once every seven years would be considered a violent Beit Din. Rabbi Elazar Ben Azariah says: \"Once every 70 years.\" Rabbi Tarfon and Rabbi 'Akiva said: \"If we were on the Sanhedrin we would never have killed anyone!\" Rabban Shim'on Ben Gamliel said: \"They would have increased violence in Israel.\""

            "These are exiled:  one who kills a human accidentally.  If he was rolling a roller and it fell on him and killed him, or if he was raising a barrel and it fell and killed him, or if he was descending a ladder and fell and killed him-- all of these would be exiled.  However, if he was pulling a roller and it fell and killed him, or if he was lowering a barrel and the rope broke and it fell and killed him, or if he was climbing a ladder and fell and killed him-- such a person is not exiled.  This is the principle:  anything that is on its way down, exile.  Anything that is not on its way down, no exile.  If the blade came off the handle and killed, Rabbi says he is not exiled but the sages say he is exiled.  If it came out of the wood being chopped, Rabbi says he is exiled but the sages say he is not exiled.", 
            "One who throws a rock into a public space and it kills someone, he is exiled.  Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says:  if the person stuck his head into the public space only after the stone left his hand, he is exempt.  If he threw the stone into his courtyard and it killed:  if the victim had permission to be there, he is exiled, but if he did not have permission, he is not exiled, as it says (Deuteronomy 19:5), \"If he comes upon his fellow in the woods...\" Just as the woods is open for both the victim and the perpetrator to be there, which excludes an owned courtyard where it is not the case that both the victim and the perpetrator have permission to be there.  Aba Shaul says: Just as chopping wood is optional, [so too one is only exiled for optional activities] which excludes a father beating his son, a teacher disciplining his student, and the messenger of the courts.", 
            "A father can be exiled on account of (killing his) son and a son can be exiled on account of (killing his) father.  All are exiled on account of (killing) an Israelite and an Israelite is exiled on account of (killing) them, except for a resident alien.  A resident alien is only exiled on account of (killing) a resident alien.  A blind person is not exiled, the words of Rabbi Judah.  Rabbi Meir says (a blind person is) exiled.  A known enemy is not exiled.  Rabbi Yose bar Yehuda says:  a known enemy is killed because he is as one who is habitual.  Rabbi Shimon says:  some known enemies are exiled and some are not exiled.  This is the general rule:  anyone who we can say killed with intent is not exiled.  If he killed without intent, he is exiled.", 
            "To where are they exiled?  To the cities of refuge:  3 on the other side of the Jordan River and 3 in the land of Canaan, as it says, (Numbers 35:14) \"Give three cities on this side of the Jordan and give three cities in the land of Canaan.\"  Until the three were chosen in the land of Canaan, the three on the other side of the Jordan did not collect, as it says, (Numbers 35:15) \"These six cities\"-- until all six can collect as one.", 
            "And roads are designated from one to the next, as it says, (Deuteronomy 19:3), \"Prepare the road and divide in thirds...\" Two sages are given to them lest they kill him on the road and they speak with him.  Rabbi Meir says:  He speaks for himself, as it says, (Deuteronomy 19:4), \"And this is the matter/word of the murderer...\"", 
            "Rabbi Yose bar Yehuda says:  At the outset, both neglectful and purposeful arrive at the city of refuge.  The court sends and takes him from there.  One who is to be killed by the court, they kill him.  One who is to be exiled, they return him to his place, as it says (Numbers 35:25), \"The community will return him to his city of refuge.\"  (The death of) one who is anointed with oil (the high priest) and one who has many clothes (a step in becoming the high priest) and one who used to be anointed, those return the killer (from the city of refuge to his city of origin).  Rabbi Judah says: even one who is anointed for the purposes of war returns the killer.  Therefore, the mothers of priests provided food and clothes (to the residents of cities of refuge), so they would not pray for their sons to die.  If the high priest died after his judgment was finished, he is not exiled.  If the high priest died before his judgment was finished and they appointed a new one and after that his judgment was finished, he is returned with the death of the second.", 
            "If his judgment is finished without a high priest, or if he kills the high priest, or a high priest who kills, those never leave there (the city of refuge).  And he may not leave in order to testify for an obligatory purpose or for a monetary case or for a capital case.  Even if Israel needs him, even if the head of the military of Israel like Yoav ben Zeruiah, he may not ever leave there.  As it says (Numbers 35:25), \"Where he ran there\"-- there must be his residence, there must be his death, there must be his burial.  Just as the city collects (protects), so too its outskirts collect.  A killer who leaves the outskirts and the blood avenger (next of kin) finds him, Rabbi Yose the Galilean says:  (killing him) is an obligation of the blood avenger and optional for anyone.  Rabbi Akiva says:  (killing him) is optional for the blood avenger and any person is not liable for it.  A tree which stands in the outskirts and its shade stretches out of the outskirts or if the tree stands out of the outskirts and its shade stretches into the outskirts, the ruling is according to the shade.  If he kills in the same city, he is exiled from one neighborhood to another neighborhood.  A Levite who kills is exiled from one city to another.", 
            "Similarly, a killer who was exiled to his city of refuge and the people of that city want to honor him, he should say to them, \"I am a killer.\"  If they say the desire even still, he should accept from them, as it says (Deuteronomy 19:4), \"This is the matter of the killer.\"  They would pay rent to the Levites, these are the words of Rabbi Judah.  Rabbi Meir says:  they do not pay them rent.  (When he returns to his city of origin) he returns to the level he had been, these are the words of Rabbi Meir.  Rabbi Judah says:  he would not return to the level he had been."
