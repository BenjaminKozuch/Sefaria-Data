            "\nOn the evening of the fourteenth [of Nissan] we check for leavened bread by candlelight. Any place which we do not bring leavened bread into does not require checking. And why did [the sages] say [that we must check up to] two rows in the wine cellar? [It is] a place which we bring leavened bread into. The House of Shammai say: Two rows upon the entire wine-cellar. The House of Hillel say: The two outer rows, which are the uppermost.", 
            "We do not need to be concerned [that] perhaps a weasel dragged [leavened bread] from [one] house to [another] house, or from [one] place to [another] place. Since if [we were to be concerned, we would also need to be concerned that <i>chamets</i> was dragged] from [one] courtyard to [another] courtyard, and from [one] city to [another] city — there [would be] no end to the matter.", 
            "Rabbi Yehuda says, \"We check on the evening of the fourteenth, and on the fourteenth in the morning, and at the time of the destruction [of <i>chamets</i>].\" And the Sages say, \"If he did not check on the evening of the fourteenth, he must check on the [day of the] fourteenth. If he did not check on the fourteenth, he must check on [the intermediate days of] the festival. If he did not check on the festival, he must check after the festival.\" And what he leaves over [on the night of the fourteenth in order to eat on the morrow], he must put in a private place, in order that checking after it shall not be necessary.",

            "Rabbi Yehudah also said, \"Two loaves of bread of a thank-offering [that had become] unfit were placed on the roof of the [Temple] portico. As long as they [both] lay [there], all the people would eat [<i>chamets</i>]. [When] one of them was removed, they would suspend and neither eat nor burn [their <i>chamets</i>]. [When] the second one of them was removed, all the people would begin burning [their <i>chamets</i>].\" Rabban Gamliel says, \"[<i>Chamets</i> that is] <i>chulin</i> [ food permitted for general consumption] may be eaten through all [the first] four [hours of the day]; but [<i>chamets</i> that is]  <i>terumah</i> [may be eaten] through all [the first] five [hours of the day]; and we must burn [all leavened bread] at the beginning of the sixth [hour].\"", 
            "Rabbi Chanina, the adjunct head of the <i>Kohanim</i> [the priestly caste, a subgroup of tribe of Levi, which is uniquely responsible for maintaining and carrying out the sacrificial services in the Temple], said, \"During [all] the days of the <i>Kohanim</i>, they never refrained from burning [sacrificial] meat that had become impure by a secondary source of impurity [along] with [sacrificial] meat that had become impure by a primary source of impurity, even though it added impurity to impurity.\"  Rabbi Akiva added and said, \"During [all] the days of the priests, they never refrained from lighting oil that had become unfit by [contact with] a <i>tevul yom</i> [a person who has immersed that day for purification but who must wait for night-fall to be fully pure] in a lamp that had become impure by one who had become impure by a corpse, even though they would [by so doing] add impurity to impurity.\"", 
            "Said Rabbi Meir, \"From their words we learn that we may burn <i> terumah</i> that is pure [that is <i>chamets</i>, together] with [<i> terumah</i>] that is impure on Pesach.\"  Rabbi Yose said to him, \"This is not analogous.  [Even] Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua concede that each is burned separately.  About what do they disagree?  Concerning [<i> terumah</i> whose status of purity was] in question and impure [<i> terumah</i>], where Rabbi Eliezer says, 'Each must be burned separately;' and Rabbi Yehoshua says, 'Both [of them may be burned] together.'\""

What [sort of] proof is it [to infer] from voluntary [acts on the festival] to [one which is] a commandment [namely, acts surrounding the offering of the Pesach sacrifice]?\" Rabbi Akiva responded and said, \"The sprinkling [of purifying waters on someone impure from contact with the dead] shall determine [this case]; for it is [also] a commandment, and is [forbidden only] on account of ‏<i>shevut</i>‎, and does not push off Shabbat; [then] you too do not wonder that these, even though they are a commandment, and are [forbidden only] on account of ‏<i>shevut</i>‎, that [they] will not push off Shabbat.\" Rabbi Eliezer said [back] to him, \"About it [too] I make the inference; if slaughtering an animal which is [forbidden] on account of ‏<i>melacha</i> pushes off Shabbat, does it not follow that the sprinkling, which is [only prohibited] on account of ‏<i>shevut‎</i>‎ should [also] push off Shabbat?\" Rabbi Akiva said [back] to him, \"Or reverse [the logic]; if the sprinkling, which is only prohibited on account of ‏<i>shevut‎</i> does [nevertheless] not push off Shabbat, does it not follow that slaughtering, which is prohibited on account of <i>melacha</i> should [also] not push off Shabbat?\" Rabbi Eliezer said [back] to him, \"Akiva! you have [thus] uprooted that which is written in the Torah, 'between the evenings... at its appointed time,' (Bemidbar 9:3), whether [that be] on a weekday or on Shabbat. \" He said [back] to him, \"My teacher!, bring me [a verse of the Torah which prescribes] an appointed time for these [acts, even] as [it does] for the slaughtering.\" [This] general rule did Rabbi Akiva say; all [‏<i>melacha</i>‎]  which is possible to do from the eve of Shabbat, does not push off Shabbat, [but] slaughtering, which is impossible to do from the eve of Shabbat, pushes off Shabbat.", 
            "When may one bring a <i>chagigah</i> [a sacrifice offered on festivals from which the owners may eat] with [in addition to the Pesach sacrifice]? When [the Pesach sacrifice is brought up] on a weekday, [when those that offer it are] in a state of purity, and [when] it is insufficient [for the number of those that are appointed to eat it]. But when it is [brought up] on Shabbat, [when] it is sufficient [for the persons appointed to eat it], or [when these are] in a state of impurity, we may not bring a <i>chagigah</i> with it.",

If he slaughtered any other sacrifices with the intention that they be a Pesach sacrifice; if the [animals] are not fit [for the requirements of a Pesach sacrifice], he is obligated; but if they are fit, Rabbi Eliezer obligates [him], but Rabbi Yehoshua exempts [him]. Said Rabbi Eliezer, \"If concerning the Pesach sacrifice which, with specific intention for it, is permitted [to slaughter on Shabbat], one who has changed the name [intention of what sacrifice it should be], is deemed to be obligated; does it not follow that when he had changed the names of other sacrifices, which are prohibited [to be slaughtered on Shabbat even] with specific intention for them, that he would, a fortiori, be guilty?\" Rabbi Yehoshua said [back] to him, \"No, can you [apply what is affirmed in respect to] the Pesach sacrifice, when its name was changed to that which is forbidden [on Shabbat], to other sacrifices where the name has been changed to what is permitted?\" Rabbi Eliezer said [back] to him, \"The public [offerings] will determine [this case,] for they are permitted on Shabbat with specific intention for them; and [yet] if one slaughters [other offerings] with the specific intention for it [to be such a sacrifice], he is guilty.\" Rabbi Yehoshua said [back] to him, \"No, can you [apply what is affirmed in respect to] the public [offerings], which have a determinate number, to the Pesach sacrifice which has no determinate number.\" Rabbi Meir said, \"Also he who slaughters [other offerings on Shabbat] with the intention that they be public [offerings] is exempt.\"", 
            "If a person slaughtered the Pesach sacrifice [on Shabbat] for those who are not [considered to be able to be] its eaters, or for those who are not designated for it, for those uncircumcised or for those impure, he is obligated; but if it had been slaughtered for those who are [considered to be able to be] its eaters and for those who are not [considered to be able to be] its eaters; or for those that are designated for it and for those that are not designated for it; or for those circumcised and for those uncircumcised; or for those impure and those pure, he is exempt. If one slaughtered it, and it was found to have a blemish, he is obligated; if, one slaughtered it, and it was found to be a <i>‏terefah‎</i> [an animal with a mortal condition such that it would die within one year] [due to a condition that is] in a hidden [location of the body], he is exempt. If one slaughters it and it [then] becomes known that the owners had withdrawn [themselves] from it, or died, or become impure, he is exempt, because he slaughtered it, when it had [still] been permitted."

            "How must we roast the Pesach sacrifice ? We bring a spit [made of the wood] of a pomegranate-tree and jab it in at its mouth [of the lamb or kid] until [it come out again at] the place of its [lower] opening; and one places its legs and its entrails inside of it - so says Rabbi Yose Haglili. Rabbi Akiva says, \"This would be a kind of boiling; rather we suspend them outside [of the lamb].\"", 
            "The paschal sacrifice may not be roasted on an iron roasting spit, nor on a gridiron [‏אסכלא‎]. R. Zadok relates that R. Gamaliel said once to his bondsman Tabbi, \"Go and roast for us the paschal sacrifice on a gridiron.\" If the roasted lamb had in any part touched the earthenware oven on which it was roasted, that part must be pared off. If the fat which drips therefrom had fallen on the oven, and had again fallen on the lamb, the part so touched must also be cut out; but if the dripping fell on [hot] fine flour, a handful [of the flour] must be taken [and burned].", 
            "If the paschal sacrifice has been anointed [or basted] with consecrated oil of heave-offering, and the company appointed to eat it consists of priests, they may eat it; but if of Israelites, they must wash it off the lamb, if yet raw; or should it have been already roasted, they must pare off the outward skin. If it had been anointed with oil of the second tithe, its value may not be charged to the company in money, because it is not lawful to redeem and sell it in Jerusalem.",

            "If, after the blood of a paschal sacrifice had been sprinkled on the altar, it became known that it was unclean, the plate or frontlet of gold [of the high priest] expiates [the sin]; but if the body of the paschal sacrifice had been polluted, the golden plate does not expiate; because it is a maxim, that the golden plate expiates the paschal sacrifice and that of the Nazarite, when the blood of these had been polluted; but it does not expiate when the body of the sacrifice had become polluted. It does, however, expiate, for [the so called] pollution of the abyss or ground.",

If the owners thereof have contracted pollution or died, it must he left till its form has passed away, and must be burned on the 16th of Nissan. R. Johanan ben Berokah says, \"That also must be burned immediately, because there are none to eat it.\"", 
            "The bones, nerves, and other remaining parts must be burned on the 16th; but if that should be a Sabbath, they must be burned on the 17th, because the burning of these does not supersede the laws of the Sabbath nor those of the festival.",

Whoever breaks any bones of the clean passover lamb, incurs the penalty of forty stripes, but the person who should leave a part of the paschal lamb over night, or who breaks a bone of an unclean paschal sacrifice, does not incur that penalty.",

With regard to other sacrifices [the bones of which might be lawfully broken], the protruding part must be cut off with a chopping knife; if it extend from the ‏אגף‎ [door-wing or lobby], it must be considered as inward; if it protrude further than this, it is to be considered as outward [and must be cut off].

When several guardians of an orphan have slaughtered paschal sacrifices for him, the orphan may go and eat it at the house he prefers.

As many people may partake of a paschal sacrifice as can obtain therefrom the quantity of meat of the size of an olive.

For a woman who has menstruated a day beyond her regular period, it may be slaughtered on her second day, and when she has done so for two consecutive days, after her regular period, it may be slaughtered for her on her third day; but for a woman subject to a flow of menses [three days beyond her regular period], it may be slaughtered on her eighth day only.",

But it may not be slaughtered for either on their own account alone, because they may cause the paschal offering to become desecrated and useless; therefore, when either of these becomes disqualified to eat it, he needs not bring a second Passover sacrifice: except the person who has dug out [a dead body] from under the ruins, since such a one is unclean from the very outset.",
