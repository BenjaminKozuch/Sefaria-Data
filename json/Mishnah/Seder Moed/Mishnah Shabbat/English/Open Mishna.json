            "There are two [types of] transfers on Shabbat which amount to four inside, and two which amount to four outside.  How so?  [This is illustrated by] a poor person standing outside and a homeowner [standing] inside: [If] the poor person reaches his hand inside and puts [something] into the hand of the homeowner, or takes [something] from [the hand] and brings it outside, the poor person is liable and the homeowner is exempt.  [If] the homeowner reaches his hand outside and puts [something] into the hand of the poor person, or takes [something] from [the hand] and brings it inside, the homeowner is liable and the poor person is exempt.  [If] the poor person reaches his hand inside and the homeowner takes [something] from it, or puts [something] into it, and [the poor person] brings it outside, they are both exempt.  [If] the homeowner reaches his hand outside and the poor person takes [something] from it, or puts [something] into it, and [the homeowner] brings it inside, they are both exempt.", 
            "A person should not sit down before the barber close to [the time of] <i>Mincha</i> [the afternoon prayer service] until he prays.  Nor should he enter a bath-house, or a tannery, or [start] eating, or judging [in court]. But if [one did] begin [such an activity], we do not interrupt him. We do interrupt for the recitation of <i>Shema</i>, but we do not interrupt for prayers.", 
            "The tailor may not go out with his needle close to nightfall [before Shabbat], lest he forget and go out [with it on Shabbat]; and neither [may] the scribe [go out] with his quill.  One may not delouse his apparel, and may not read by lamp light [on Shabbat].  In truth they said: The instructor may check where the students are reading but he may not read.  Similarly, a <i>Zav</i> [a man suffering from gonorrhea] may not eat with a <i>Zavah</i> [a woman with a menstrual-type flow occurring at a time other than her normal period] because familiarity leads to sin.", 
            "And these are some of the regulations enacted in the attic of Hananiah ben Chizkiyah ben Guryon when [the rabbis] went up to visit him. They called the roll and found that [members of] Beit Shammai outnumbered those of Beit Hillel and they decreed eighteen regulations on that day.", 
            "Beit Shammai say: One may not steep ink, dye, or vetches [fodder] in water [on Friday] unless there is sufficient time for them to dissolve while it is still day.  But Beit Hillel permit it.", 
            "Beit Shammai say: One may not put bundles of flax into the oven [on Friday] unless they will be steamed during the day; nor wool into the vat unless it will absorb the color. But Beit Hillel permit it. Beit Shammai say: One may not spread traps for animals, birds or fish [on Friday] unless they will ensnare [their quarry] during the day.  But Beit Hillel permit it.", 
            "Beit Shammai say: One should not sell [anything] to a non-Jew [on Friday], or help him load [an animal], or lift [a burden] onto himself, unless there is sufficient time for him to reach a neighboring place [before Shabbat].  But Beit Hillel permit it.", 
            "Beit Shammai say: One may not deliver hides to a non-Jewish tanner, or clothes to a non-Jewish launderer [on Friday], unless there is sufficient time for them to complete [the work before Shabbat].  Beit Hillel permit [one to act] in all of these [cases]  as long as the sun [is shining].", 
            "Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: It was the custom in my father's house to deliver white garments to the non-Jewish launderer three days before Shabbat.  [Both schools] agree that one may load the beams of the oil-press, and the cylinders on the wine-press [just before Shabbat].", 
            "One may not roast meat, onions, or eggs [on Friday] unless there is sufficient time for them to get roasted during the day [before Shabbat]. One may not put bread into the oven towards dusk [nightfall on Friday], nor cakes on the coals, unless there is sufficient time in the day for its surface to form a crust [before Shabbat]. Rabbi Eliezer says [unless there is sufficient time for] its bottom [surface] to form a crust.", 
            "One may lower the Passover offering into the oven towards dusk [on Friday].  And [the priests in the Temple] may kindle the fire in the hearth-room [on Friday], but outside [the Temple a fire may be lit] only if there is sufficient time for the fire to ignite the greater part of the wood. Rabbit Yehudah says: With regard to coals [it is acceptable] if any part of them becomes ignited [before Shbbat]."
